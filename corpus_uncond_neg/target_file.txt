Very Disappointed My boyfriend and I traveled with friends and stayed at the Ocean Sands Golf  Beach Resort from April 18th to April 25th 2006. We have stayed at all inclusive resorts in Cuba and the Mayan Rivera several times with no problems that we would bring to anyone鈥檚 attention.  CHECK IN: Upon arrival check in went pretty smooth although we had requested an adjoining room which we did not get or a king bed. We stayed in 8112 and our friends stayed in 8114. ROOMS: We stayed in Villa 8 as it is close to the pool and beach and only a short walk to the buffet and main lobby. We stayed on the main level Room 8112 and 8114 (main floor). Rooms were not bad, but not 5 star quality in our opinion. I really am not a picky person when it comes to traveling, I realize that we are going to other countries and some things will be out of sort. Upon arrival in our room the safe was locked and needed to be reset so we could use it. It took the staff 4 days to come and re-set the safe after many phone calls. We had to use the safe in 8114. The Signature brochure showed that the mini fridge was stocked daily and we received 2 mini beer and a couple of waters the day we arrived and after that we had to pay for it. We would leave money in the fridge and they would take the money and not leave the beverages including bottled water. One night we had come back to room 8114 and noticed that the bathroom had flooded from the ceiling. Water soaked the entire bathroom and there were sand and rocks that fell into the shower/tub. We used every towel to clean up the mess and thought it would be a one time occurrence but it happened a couple days later but this time the entire bathroom ceiling bowed down and exploded with water. They took the ceiling slats down and it gushed everywhere. Obviously they have plumbing issues in this hotel. We also noticed that our bedding was not changed while we stayed there and the rooms were never properly cleaned. I don't think they cleaned our bathroom once the entire 7 days. The phones in the room only worked on and off. 8112 had major cracks in the ceiling and for the resort only being a year old the inside of the rooms lacked serious maintenance.POWER OUTAGES: The first time the power went out it was around 8:00pm until 12:30am. The entire resort was pitch black as they have NO back up lighting. People were scrambling looking for their toddlers in the dark. We had to go into the A La Carte restaurants and take candles off the table so we had some light and not knowing how long it would last. When the electricity goes out, so does the water. No water in the sinks, shower or toilet for several hours. We had to use our garbage can to get water from the fountains to put into the toilet tanks so we could flush. The next day the power went out again around 4:00pm when people were getting ready to shower up for dinner and again NO water. We saw people showering in the pool and one lady used conditioner in her hair and rinsed in the pool. The power came back on an hour later but the water stayed off for over 3 hours. We didn't have any more episodes during our stay. The power outage was only our resort, the others were fine. RESTAURANTS: The buffet was the best by far. There are a lot of choices and we didn't have any problems. We tried the Mexican restaurant and the food was not edible. We took one bite each and walked out and went to the buffet. The Italian restaurant was not much better but we ate a bit and then went to the buffet for some more. The restaurants are like they have all the meals pre-made and they serve it buffet style from the kitchen as you get it within 10 mins of sitting down at your table. There was one restaurant down by the beach which was pretty good, we had the beef tenderloin and we enjoyed it.  BEACH/POOL: The pool was fine, but the beach is super noisy with motor boats and helicopters constantly running by. At the beach they rope off the area where you can swim and it is pretty narrow. We couldn't go past the buoys or you risk losing a limb to the crazy boat drivers! Lots of seaweed and they don't clean up the beach. There were plastic glasses and straws everywhere. I was not impressed.  STAFF: The staff aimed to please. They were friendly but kept to themselves or would just say they didn't understand and walk away. I am surprised that the resort allows the Royal Holiday people to stand outside the buffet and try to talk you into buying into their time shares. One couple we knew did attend the 1.5 hour session and got a free massage but they want you to drop $16,000 US on your credit card right then and there as the deposit and then pay the remainder later. We had terrible experiences every day being asked by staff members if we wanted to purchase cocaine or marijuana from them. The security guards were the worst - very persistent - This is not acceptable and I informed Max (our Signature rep at the resort) of this problem. Overall I would give this resort a 2 out of 5 based on our experiences. Again, we have been to several all inclusive resorts and never complained once and had a fantastic time. To pay over $4200 for two people plus spending money on top of that, you are better off staying at another hotel and not take the chance at this one. It's funny that Signature Vacations will not recommend certain excursions off the resort as they are not safe or worth the money in their opinion, but they still will list and recommend this resort in their travel brochure.  I am extremely displeased with this trip and filed a report with Signature Vacations. It is my belief that Signature should pull this resort from their packages.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.We went there, no one greeted us.Who is giving this place 4 stars? I have never written a review before. I travel a lot, but I have never been more compelled to warn fellow travelers. Room DOES NOT look like any promotional photo I've seen anywhere. Where are the rooms in the pictures? I literally teared up when I saw the room and realized we wouldn't have time to change hotels before we had to get to an event we came to town for. I asked the bellman if there were some other rooms that had been renovated and maybe my room was one that had not? He said it had been renovated a year and a half ago? I asked if there were any nicer rooms or if they were all like mine with dirty carpet, walls, etc. and he said they all looked like mine, but some rooms on higher floors had new headboards. Um, the headboard was the least of my concerns. Out of fairness I would try to balance this review with the positives, but as far as the room is concerned, there were not any. I will post some pictures which pretty much speak for themselves. We wore socks the entire time, i used a dog blanket from the car instead of the duvet which had no cover on it (and i'm sure is not regularly washed), i took a shower standing on a towel! thank goodness i had some anti bacteria wipes in my purse so I could use the remote control and wipe down a few things. I don't drink, but i had a drink with dinner in the hopes i would pass out and not have to think about how grossed out i was sleeping there. Check-in was a pain too. We checked in at 5pm. i reserved 2 beds. Didn't want to share a bed with my mom, thanks. I reconfirmed the 2 beds a day or 2 prior. Get to the desk and they want to put me in a king. I ask how long the wait might be if we decide to wait for a double room to become available? She doesn't know. I ask if a room is expected to be available that night? don't know. then she says they are "low" on double rooms. They weren't even out of double rooms and shes giving me a hard time. So I asked if I could have one of these available rooms and she had to ask a manager. that takes a bit of time. the people behind me are annoyed. i think there was only one other person at the front desks. So finally we get the room but really, what are they holding on to the rooms for? Obviously this was no VIP room they needed to keep open. A little more about the room before i sign off-- no duvet covers on the very thin, beigh/tan comforters. At least with covers, you kind of feel like there's a chance they wash those every once in a while. But I doubt these comforters are washed regularly just because it isn't practical and especially in a place like this. Carpet spotted, stained and dingy. Dreary color scheme. brown, tan, off white and then there is the nightmarish abstract "art" on the walls. just black and white splatters. Very cheerful. Not. Really brightened up the room. not. I just looked at the promo pics again. they show rooms with duvet covers, throw blankets at the foot of the bed, reading lights in the headboards, desks, desk chairs. My room had NONE of these things. How's that for bait and switch. Somewhere in the written hotel description they use the word "tranquil". Um, no. The fact that there was some sort of band playing outside until 2am is not the hotels fault, but they also shouldn't imply that the noise from the city is magically blocked out. They do not have any special noise reducing windows, etc. I have no idea where the music was coming from, but from the 35th floor I could make out the lyrics word for word. It was that loud. I'm really sooo disappointed. I do not understand how a hotel gets away with such a bait and switch. I book a lot of travel for people at the financial company I work at. I'm so glad it was me that found out about this hotel. If I had sent my bosses to a hotel like this, there would be repercussions. The room really affected the quality of my trip to NYC. While we were away from the hotel, I was dreading going back. And even though I'm home in my nice clean house, writing about this is even giving me the creeps. 6/30 - It's 2 weeks later now and the experience still bothers me every time I think about the trip. I did my research before booking this hotel. I saw photos. My mother rarely travels and so I wanted her to have a nice time--not to have to worry that she forgot and almost got out of bed without putting socks on before her feet touched the floor. I emailed the concierge about 7-10 days ago to ask for an email address of someone in management that I could forward this review to. I have not received a response, but I'm not surprised. Just today someone asked me about that trip (FYI Millennium, she also books tons of corporate travel to NY) the first thing out of my mouth was how horrible the hotel was. Last week I booked travel for some of the people in my office. The hotel they normally stay at was booked and they wanted something close to our offices in NY and near enough to the park for jogging. If I had a good experience at this hotel, I would have booked it for my Team in a minute. So on top of leaving me with a bad memory, the hotel lost out on a 3 night stay for 7 people. 21 rooms. As well as any future business my office could have given them. Hope the money they save by not cleaning, getting rid of ripped sheets, changing ruined carpets, removing spider webs, etc. is worth the money, the loss of business, and their reputation. I will never stay at The Millennium Broadway New York or any affiliated hotels again.We spent weeks looking at tripadvisor reviews of the Grand Sunset Princess and must say that what we read was pretty much true. We work hard for our money and go on holiday rarely. We were a group of 11 from Ontario and BC and we have to say that this resort has left a bad taste in all of our mouths. Check in - We came in through Houston and due to weather, we were delayed overnight. But we had bookit.com (the online company we used) call the resort to tell them we would be a day late and to ensure that our rooms would be ready for us when we arrived the next day at 11 am. Somebody at bookit.com spoke with Nacho at the front desk and told them we would be delayed and to also let our family members already there know why we would be late. This message was never passed on, nor did Nacho at the resort record this note he took onto our file, nor did he let our family know. So when we arrived at noon the following day we were met with.. "oh you were no shows so we gave your rooms away. You will have to leave the resort. We are full and have no room for you." Then they tried to say that they had never been paid for our rooms. I had our documentation and did call bookit and spent 1 hr 30 min on the phone with a great guy who got the marketing manager in Cancun for the resort involved as well as the resort manager. They did give us 3 rooms in the platinum section, but no upgrade to the service. The bottom line is that the resort just does not care. It is all a money grab. Speaking with others, their rooms had been given away too. Some families took night flights, arriving at 5 am and had made arrangements to have a room ready for them by paying for the prior night - and guess what? Their rooms had been given away as well as they were considered no shows! Nobody ever apologized to us. In fact the manager who told us to leave the resort never ever came back out to the front desk to talk to us in the end. He had an employee issue us the rooms. Bottom line... if you arrive late, your room will not be there for you. My family thought that a plane had gone down.. They kept checking the front desk and hmmm.. the message they kept getting was, no, they have not checked in yet. Weird that they still had our name then! Customer Service - being in a platinum room with no platinum service meant no access to the lounge, food, liquor.. and that was fine. But when my cousin (deaf and epileptic) lost her medical alert bracelet, we walked into the lounge to see if they had found it around the pool and we were promptly met with "You will have to leave. You are not to be in this section!" The man would not even entertain our question! When the front desk heard about this and how we were treated, they claimed to be apologetic, but really the damage was done. The hardest working people we saw were in the restaurants, the bellboys and the maids. Front desk staff - all rude, no smiles, and they could really care less about helping you. I could not even make this stuff up folks! Spend your money elsewhere and go where they actually treat you with respect! Food - buffets - something for everyone, but really repetitive. The same salads are out for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There is the sports bar near the sunset lobby where you can get popcorn, a hotdog, nachos and cheese and a drink, play some pool or foosball, but that is it. Restaurants - a la carte restaurant reservations are a joke at the Sunset. You can have 2 dinners for a week's stay. When we tried to get our reservations on Wed, we were told that they were all booked up and we would have to wait until Sun and Mon for our two reservations. Guess what? We get there at 6 and there are 4 tables in the whole restaurant being served. The other tables are empty! Why? The resort simply does not have the staff to open up any more tables. It is a crazy system, that is for sure. The fondue restaurant is great - cheese fondue with salmon, chicken, beef and veggies and chocolate fondue for dessert with fruit. Mexican restaurant was good too - offered fajitas or snapper as the main meal with salad bar and soup. Beach - very nice. Pools - lots to choose from. When you walk from the beach to the lobby, you will pass by a number of pools. Chairs - there are lots, but you need to set your alarm and get down to the pool by 7 am with a towel or something to save them or you will not get a chair for that day! Everyone saves the chairs there. Introductions - Nobody will meet you at the lobby to tell you where things are. In fact, I wandered the lobby area after we finally got checked in just asking anyone and everyone questions. I learned more about where the restaurants, theatre from strangers. Again, the customer service is terrible. Shuttles - there are golf carts to help shuttle people from one end of the resort to the other if you need it. The resort is massive! We have been to other all inclusive places, but this one was gigantic! We were disappointed at the size actually. It is not elderly or senior friendly at all. If you need a golf cart, have fun trying to track a driver down! Some people actually took the keys from the ignition and headed down on there own since the wait was 40 min one night! It actually turned comical after a while. Don't count on a shuttle, that is for sure. Shuttle to Playa del Carmen -leaves from Riviera lobby - nobody tells you that..... We were at the Sunset Lobby - leaves at 10, 11, 12 and 1 pm each day... but you need a green ticket from the bellboy to board it so get to the Riviera Lobby early or you will not get a ticket! Again, talk to others at the resort. Concierge did not know that you needed a ticket to board! And his desk is right near where the bus boards! Just hop a taxi back (12$ US) or you can wait until 6 pm to be picked up. This review is sooo negative, but I seriously considered booking elsewhere when I read the other reviews. I really wish that I had followed through with my gut feeling and cancelled when I could and booked elsewhere. A lot of money was spent and we were not happy at all. We did speak with a lot of people and yes, there are a lot of unhappy people there now. 180 reviews on trip advisor about the Sunset.. Hmmmm.. there are 1400 rooms and it has been at capacity since the past month. You folks are not hearing the half of it I am sure! Please email me if you have questions. We will not return to the Sunset nor would be recommend it to anyone! Cancel if you can! There are a lot of nice resorts around Cancun! Things have really not looked up there at all! Best of luck if you do go.. Go with a lot of patience - you will need it starting from the day you check in!We stayed at the Crowne Plaza in San Diego's Mission Valley on Sunday, Aug. 31, 2008 and we will NEVER stay there again! Unlike some of the other reviewers, I felt the rooms were well-decorated - our room had framed floral prints on the walls - the bed was new and the linens were expensive. The carpet had a brown and gold checkered pattern and was new-ish and clean - and, yes, we checked to make CERTAIN the floors/carpets were clean after reading the other reviews. Even more important, the bathrooms were clean as well. There was no mildew in the bath/shower and the shower curtain hangs on a convex rod that keeps it from touching you during a shower. Fine. The vanity and floors were of the same matching tile - heavy, modern stuff. The vanity had two sinks - always a plus for my partner and me - it makes getting out in the mornings much more efficient. The free shower soaps and shampoos were of high quality and the towels were plush enough. The room (Room 1337 BTW) seemed to be recently renovated or was simply well-maintained. Not at all unpleasant. All of the above goes in the "plus" category. However, in the "minus" category: The hotel tries for a faux tropical feel (read: Hawaiian tat) but it is a very sad attempt at a theme that simply does not work. It is filled with poorly done (very perfunctory) water features - tacky, tacky, tacky - and the odd, sad, faded, captive coi that seemed to call out, "Save me, kind sir, for God's sake end my misery." Ugh! One of the elevators was out. Really? On a holiday weekend? The real negative stuff started when we found that the hotel is built on large eight-story high horseshoe shaped courtyard. Not good! Every door that closed - no I got that wrong - EVERY DOOR THAT WAS SLAMMED SHUT and slammed shut EVERY TIME the doors were closed reverberated in our room like a cannon being fired. It was astounding the amount of noise that was generated and the number of booms we heard from these slamming doors - there were hundreds of them! HUNDREDS! Especially on Sunday morning! Yes, many other reviewers mention this fact - but take my word for this - I have NEVER experienced such a cacophony - I kept shouting, "Incoming! and "Take Cover!" Wow! We went to San Diego because we have a season subscription at LaJolla Playhouse. We go to get away from the noise and pace of Los Angeles - not to attempt to relax in the middle of a reenactment of the Civil War. When we went out on the balcony and saw the state of the facilities and were not pleased at all. We were on the third floor overlooking the swimming pool. On either side of our balcony was the top of some sort of supporting structure or perhaps storage units. No matter, they are covered with ugly broken wooden lattices - they must have been new at some point - perhaps back in the early 1990s - now they are broken and junky and should be scrapped. There is trash and TOWELS that have been dropped from the floors above collected in these lattices and it is simply a mess. Ugh - again! It appears that the Management at the Crowne Plaza does only what is required and does not choose to go that little extra distance or put in that little extra effort to make a guest's stay NICE. Isn't NICE the goal? Well it oughta be! It doesn't have to be perfect - just NICE! Now on to the worst aspect of the place. The smoking! We cannot abide smoky hotel rooms and will move to another hotel instead of staying in a room that has been infused with cigarette smoke. One reason we chose the Crowne Plaza was that the entire wing we were in was SUPPOSED to be non-smoking. THAT IS A LAUGH! When we entered the room, I remarked that the place smelled like a hotel room - fresh linen - recently cleaned - you know, like a non-smoking hotel room usually smells - no smoke at all. So far so good. We WERE a bit put off by the "survival kit" that was on the bed when we entered though. Other reviewers have mentioned this "kit" but I will reiterate - it contains three very tell-tale objects. Ear-plugs - oh no! - a sleep mask to cover your eyes - say it ain't so! - and finally a tiny spray bottle of lilac linen freshener - huh? Well, I suppose that the first two items are self-explanatory - too much noise (see the report from the front-lines above) and too much light - although I did not find there was too much light in the room - and there was a drape clip attached to the drape pull that made keeping the light out a snap. (Perhaps this is for people whose closet lights will not go off - as mentioned in other reviews.) But as for the third item (the spray) it was not until late at night that we finally got it. Right in the kisser! Yes, our wing was non-smoking - the floors above us and below were non-smoking - but somebody, somewhere was smoking in that hotel - SEVERAL SOMBODIES IN FACT! Our room filled with noxious cigarette smoke at regular intervals ALL NIGHT LONG and it worsened in the morning when all those smokers somewhere in the Crowne Plaza (AND MY PARTNER AND I) - EVEN THOUGH WE *DON'T* SMOKE!!! - partook of that first cigarette of the day! Jeez! We needed gas masks (to maintain up the battlefield motif of this review.) Why claim non-smoking rooms at all when it is obvious that the air-conditioning or ventilation system is so poorly engineered that is simply sucks all the smoke from other parts of the hotel into your room anyway! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE and another reason we will NEVER stay at the Crowne Plaza again. And let me assure you that tiny bottle of lilac linen spray is not sufficient to combat the onslaught of smoke. If only that were possible! A few other ideas in response to some of the other reviewers comments. The lights in our lighted closets DID do out when the doors were closed, so we did not have to contend with that. And I agree with some of the other reviewers - the safes are laughably small. About a foot wide and perhaps two inches deep. "Really? Really? Then you try to get your valuables in there!" And I don't travel with many valuables. Ludicrous! I found the staff friendly enough - unlike some of the other reviewers. The parking costs $12.00 for a 24-hour period and had in/out privileges. Pretty standard. The exhaust fan in the bathroom did not draw and the room stayed steamy all morning - why?, why? Why ask why? Towels are provided at pool side. Very good. And there is a separate area for sun-bathers away from the pool itself. VERY GOOD! But I felt the pool was under-chlorinated (dangerous) and it was filled with dead insects - it needed to be skimmed. We got out when someone in the pool suggested it was filled with salt water. It was simply under-chlorinated so it did not seem like most other "public" pools that one experiences! Ugh - a third time! Skip this place if you are able. We got a deal on Hotwire that I feel was not worth it in hindsight. There are so many choices in Mission Valley as well as LaJolla and San Diego and environs - surely there are better hotels that the Crowne Plaza!I stayed for 2 days in January to attend a conference (I'm an attorney). I brought along two t-shirts - one to sleep in, one to work out in. It was chilly in the room the last evening so I wore both. One was an extra soft "Life is Good" shirt my hubby got me on a trip and the other was a shirt the Obama campaign gave us in return for a donation. On Jan 30, I checked out early (around 8:30 am) to get to my conference. I packed my belongings - my two shirts in a shopping bag. Big mistake. I picked up my two bags in the afternoon and dropped them off at a nearby hotel (my husband was joining me that evening for a weekend in NY). Around 7 pm, I am unpacking and can't find my two tees. I think - well, maybe I left them in the room (although I'm 95% sure I did not as I travel alot for business and pleasure and I'm good about triple checking my room before I depart). Anyway, I run across the street - I see security. They take me to the room (which was cleaned but unoccupied). Nothing there. Nobody returned the shirts to the Lost & Found. I check the baggage check area - where I paid $3.50 for the day, presumably to keep my bags secure. No response. So they ask me to fill out a report, slip me a number to call "Mike in security" during the week to check with him to see if the shirts turn up. I do so the next week. Mike basically tells me he has "no idea" why they told me to call him. Really? A guest has items missing from either the room or the baggage area and SECURITY has "no idea" why I'm calling? Especially galling since SECURITY gave me "Mike's" number in the first place. I explain this to Mike. I also ask for the name of the Manager of the hotel, as I think maybe he should know about this. He tells me: "I can tell you right now that he isn't going to care. He'll refer you right back to us [SECURITY]." Then he says "oh, the baggage claim is not Hilton - it's a third party contractor." I replied, "Nice try, but it is the hotel's responsibility and at the end of the day, the hotel should know if any thefts are occurring on its premises." I also mentioned that on THursday, January 29, I was rudely treated by the maid on my floor Sophia. Here's what happened - I went back for my lunch break and went into my room to watch television. My remote control was gone. Since my room was clean and I had seen Sophia down the hall, I walked up, said "excuse me, I'm staying in room such and such, where is my remote?" She didn't respond. She waved me away. I asked again. She pointed down the LOOOONG hall: "Go ask her." And she turned away. So I walked down to the other end of the hall and ask this poor woman, whose name, unfortunately, I didn't get because it seemed she actually cared about doing a decent job and treating guests with respect. She said "Sophia cleaned your room -- Hold on, I'll find out..." she walked with my down the hall and asked Sophia about it. Sophia, annoyed, said "what? what are you talking about." This poor woman said "her TV REMOTE! You cleaned her room! Do you have it?" Of course, Sophia did - she had taken it from my room for some reason and put it in another and couldn't be bothered to answer my question. So of course I thought, well IF I did forget and leave my two tees in the room, maybe the oh-so-helpful Sophia would "forget" that she saw the tees although why someone would steal two tees I'll never know. So I mentioned this to "Mike." No effect. A week later, I get a call from a David H. in security asking me to call him. I think - wow, maybe they found them in the laundry or something - that's great. I call back. Nope. David wants to know whether I have receipts for the tees. I was flabbergasted. Now I have to prove that I had them? I have time to make up stories about two tees not worth more than $30? I explained to him that the one tee I got on a trip to MD with my hubby in October 2007 - so, uh, no I wouldn't have a receipt for that. As for my Obama tee - it was a gift from the campaign so in a way it is priceless. I explained that to this guy and then asked why - and he said "well, we need to know what they were worth IN CASE WE'RE LIABLE." Um, ok. I still plan to contact the hotel management. That was the most ridiculous, aggravating and downright obnoxious experience I have EVER had at a hotel. Like I said, I travel alot for business and pleasure and I have never had something go missing. I also felt like the so-called SECURITY Team was completely uninterested in my plight. I mean, I did say - yea, I get it, they're just two t-shirts, no big deal, but they are MY t-shirts and I like them both. I'd like to recover them. The whole thing left a bitter taste. Terrible hotel. Terrible service. Terrible follow up. Stay at the Warwick or the London. Hilton has gone down the hill. I will never stay at a Hilton, anywhere, ever again.This is a new property, booked directly on Radisson.com. It opened 3 days before my arrival. Billed as 1km away from Dubai Mall/Burj Khalifa. Since it was a new property, I downloaded the map displayed on their website. Arrived at Dubai airport, jumped in a taxi and we drove around for an eternity - the driver could not find the hotel. He called several times for directions and we appeared to be driving through non existent roads, but service roads through building sites. Out of frustration, we asked the taxi driver to let us out near a metro station and the hotel told us they would send a driver to collect us. The driver turned up around 10 minutes later. We were impressed by the hotel for doing this. This lasted momentarily. It was no wonder the taxi driver could not locate the hotel, it is in the middle of a building site with no infrastructure in terms of a road. Unless you knew the hotel was there, you would never find it. In short - the hotel has opened ahead of time, with no main road access. The hotel is glass and steel, minimalistic. Apart from myself/partner, there appeared to be around 10 other guests that we saw - Mostly Russian. The breakfast buffet was poor. Granted, with so few guests, wastage needs to be taken into account, but with more staff than guests, the sensible thing to do would be replenish little but often. This was not the case. A European Head Chef, clearly visible, who has not taught the ' egg station ' how to fry eggs. not count, since 2 fried eggs over easy are in fact 1 egg and crisp frisby's. I understand there are teething problems when a new hotel opens, but c'mon, a European Head Chef can oversee a handful of guests and the staff to offer a better quality experience. Rooms are nice, fresh and as usual with the Radisson group, internet access is free. The bathroom was foolishly finished with a tub and a shower attached to the taps. Zero water pressure. The hotel as a whole, is glass and steel and lacks any warmth. The pool area is large, but simply concrete surrounds. The hotel has views over the entire area, which is simply a building site. Food at the hotel, a cafe to speak of, was expensive. 55 dhs for a panini is ridiculous. The feeling is of imprisonment. The mall is 1km away, but there is no read access. The hotel, savvy to this fact, provides a shuttle service to the mall. ' As and when Guests need it '. Not so. It also seats 7 people. I needed to visit a friend in Satwa, I asked the reception if I could take the shuttle to the mall where I would pick up a taxi. They assured me the hotel limousine was ' slightly ' more expensive than a taxi. I am very familiar with Dubai and ' slightly ' was in fact triple, the meter starts at 8.5dhs before you leave the complex, a taxi starts at 3dhs. My taxi ride was 60dhs. From Dubai Mall, the ride is actually 11dhs. When I returned to the mall, I called the hotel for a shuttle pick up and was told I would need to wait one hour, the shuttle driver had a previous appointment taking a guest to ' The Address '. My understanding was the shuttle only takes guests to and from the Mall. I took a local taxi and directed him through the building site, which due to the navigation adds mileage and so you pay accordingly, if the hotel opened when the road was complete the taxi fare would be a few dirhams. When I arrived back at the hotel, since it's new, Radisson have clearly sent some European employees to oversee it's opening. I approached Reception and detailed the limousine experience. I know hotel limousine's are more expensive, but was assured slightly more expensive .... in my mind, that does not mean triple. Since you cannot call a taxi, you are reliant upon them. The money was not the question, being lied to by a 5 star hotel - clearly integrity isues. I was told the shuttle had no fixed time and Guests would be taken and picked up as their needs required. I explained this was clearly not the case. The response was apologies and ' What can we do to make it right ?' You tell me. Am I to suggest a complimentary stay, a refund of the limousine fare, an upgrade for my next stay .... not forthcoming and as a guest, not for me to suggest. Whilst I was relaying my grief, another guest, female, was at the reception having gone through the same experience as I, only the local taxi she took, dumped her on the roadside, refusing to drive any further through the building site. As a business traveller, she was late to all her meetings. I returned to my room, only to find that in the 4 hours since I had left, despite leaving the ' Please Clean my room ' card on the door, my room had not been serviced. I returned to reception and at this time, the European employee I had met, was now speaking to the Hotel Manager and relaying my experience. The Manager did not speak to me. I was staying on a discounted rate. It was a rate offered by Radisson, that does not mean I am not a Guest regardless of what I paid. That evening, we climbed over the temporary wall and walked through the dust to the main road and onto the mall. There was no way we were going to wait an eternity for the ' shuttle available as and when a guest needs it ' to take us there. I was told that they have no control over roads being built. Granted. But you cannot open a hotel with no infrastructure, access to the hotel is reliant upon a road being completed. Having checked the website again, there is still no mention that the property has no main road access. We checked out early. Once the public road into the hotel opens, there is no question, the location will be great. My experience lacked integrity, a lack of being able to win back a guest and with so many hotel rooms in Dubai now, needs to up it's game a great deal. I am a keen Radisson guest, and will continue to be, but this property lacks in every respect. Photos attached.I apologise for the length of this review but spending 5 minutes reading it may save you problems. My wife and I booked this hotel for 8 nights through an agent and pre-paid on arrival to secure the best rate. We left at 1am in the morning after staying just 3 nights. We are both seasoned travellers and we have NEVER left a hotel before during the middle of our stay. In the interests of a balanced review I will outline the GOOD points of this hotel. The buffet breakfast was excellent in terms of quality and variety. The beds we had were comfortable and the room was acceptably clean. The location of the hotel was very convenient. Now I will explain the BAD points. Firstly on arrival they did not have me listed on the booking which was a minor problem. Then they made a mistake on the charges which needed correcting - this was just a little annoying. When we tried to use the room safe we found it did not work so went to Reception who without checking assured us it did work but I was not using it properly. Eventually they sent a technician to our room who found that the batteries in the safe door needed replacing which is why it would not close. The safe worked for 1 day before failing to close and again the technician had to be called. Initially Reception insisted we wait in the room for the technician until I explained that the safe was empty and open at which point they relented and it was fixed. The next issue was that both the bedside lights did not work. Again we had to ask for the technician to come to fix them. As far as the room goes it was quite small and cluttered for two people for 8 days (I estimate about 200 square feet including bath and toilet) and it was badly designed with so many light switches that I was treated to a disco sensation every time my wife used the bathroom. Also they managed to squeeze in a desk and reclining chair which would have been good IF the room had been larger. The room had been refurbished within the last 2 or 3 years in my estimation but it was not done to a great standard and there was missing grout and some mould in the bathroom. Room facilites were limited. There was no kettle or even an alarm clock or a radio though there was a TV. There were 2 particularly annoying features. The internal soundproofing was awful so we could hear lots of noise from the rooms above and next to us especially the scraping of furniture as the floors were wooden. In addition we were 2 rooms away from the lift and when you were in bed you could clearly hear the lift bell at night. The other annoying feature was the fire detector / alarm which was located right above the bed and flashed brightly every 3 seconds. Luckily we always carry earplugs and eye masks so we could cope with these 2 issues. Also towels and toiletaries were not replaced 100 percent as they should have been. We picked this hotel for the pool. When we went to use it we were told it would cost Euro 15 for each of us per day. According to our travel agent the website does not tell you of this extra charge and I am told the hotel verbally admitted this but would not relent and allow us to use the facilities for free - although at the end they offered my wife one free day to use the pool facilities. All of the above is not good for a ´´5 star´¨ hotel but that is NOT why we left. On the fourth night we came back to our room at about 11pm and wanted a bath. The hot water ran brown (the cold seemed to be clear). It was not only brown but has scum on top and bits of detritus in. We called Reception who said let the bath run for a short time and it will go clear. We let it run for maybe 10 - 15 minutes and it was still brown so Reception sent up a technician who confirmed it was still brown! We asked Reception what the problem was. They came up with various answers such as it is a broken pipe outside and all the hotels in the area are affected (but if so why was the cold water running clear) but it became apparant that they just did not know. I asked if it was safe to use and they said absolutely it was. I then asked how could they say that it was safe if they did not know why it was happening. I also asked why they were not informing the guests and issuing bottled water - I was not given any answer to these 2 questions. We then asked to speak to the Duty Manager - AND WERE TOLD THAT THIS ¨¨5 STAR¨¨ 200+ BEDROOM HOTEL DOES NOT HAVE A MANGER AT NIGHT EVER!! (and this is standard in Spain!) and so the only person to deal with was the 23 year old (my guess) part-time student receptionist. The Manager (Fatima?) was at home and we awaited a call from her which never came. Eventually at midnight we asked for a refund for the 5 nights we had not used and we were told we had to wait until the Manager arrived in the morning. I said that the hotel now ought to call the police in to mediate as I was so unhappy and funnily enough within 2 or 3 minutes we had a refund and were able to leave!! I will try and tell Melia about this review and see what they have to say but we are now in a centrally located 5 star hotel paying about Euro 5 LESS a night with access to the business lounge and a 600 sq foot room. The other issue we found is that the staff we spoke to on Reception apart from 2 young girls spoke very little English - which is not what you expect for a so called ¨¨5 Star¨¨ hotel. They also had a really bad attitude apart from one tall slim blonde girl who spoke good English and was really helpful - but she was not there when we left.If you're someone who likes to judge a book by it's cover, then Paris will create an amazing first impression. However, once you actually start to look inside the book, some less than favorable things will start to surface by the end of the first chapter. The positives? Paris is one of the few hotels on the strip that really shines when it comes to establishing a theme and carrying it through. The common areas are beautiful and do a great job of making you feel like you've traveled across the pond to France. There is a great amount of attention to detail and the casino common areas and promenade between Paris and Bally's are just lovely. Overall the food is quite good. The 24-hour cafe and selections from room service were very tasty. The Burger Brasserie, situated just outside Bally's, was a great, quick choice with burgers and fries that kept us coming back several times during our stay. And best of all, the Burger Brasserie's prices are a great value for the quality and amount of food you get. Also, the drink service in the casino area was among the best I've ever encountered, you never go thirsty while playing and the cocktail servers are very, very sweet and professional and remember what you like to drink day after day. Mon Ami Gabi is just a magical place to eat. If you can sit outside, it's worth the effort and wait. Dining while the fountains are dancing across the street is unforgettable, and the food and drinks are among the best for the dollar. The business center staff are to be commended. Unbeknownst to myself, two of my credit cards and my social security card fell out of my wallet while I was rummaging through it at the business center. The clerk found them after I left and called by room to let me know. So nice to know honest folks still exist. The negatives? Quite a few I'm afraid. 1. At check-in, you get the feeling you're at a used car lot trying to get a good deal. Make a request for a room upgrade (even when willing to pay extra for it) and you'll find that they're "totally full" and "nothing's available." However, the mere appearance of a $20 bill in your hand subtly placed on the counter causes miraculous things to happen. I'd read about this trick from other's experiences on this board, and sure enough, once I let the front desk person notice the folded bill, we went from having a low floor, bally's roof view to a 28th floor fountain view, recently renovated, corner "p" suite... at no extra cost. I feel bad that I helped promote this practice, but it did work. Ultimately, it's just bad business for mgmt to allow this to happen. First come, first served ought to be rule. 2. The place just can't handle crowds. The shopping/dining promenade between Bally's/Paris simply can't handle the traffic with numerous bottlenecks that make you feel like you're in line for theme park attraction. Want to eat at the buffet? Be prepared for at least a one-hour wait for (at any time of day, even 2-3 pm). Aside from breakfast, it's a buffet experience that's as average as they come. At one point, the line stretched from the entrance of the buffet to just before the Burger Brasserie, which is about 50 feet from the Bally's entrance. According to the signs, that would be at least a 2 hour wait... for a buffet. These lines for the food establishments also exacerbate the crowding of the walkway and trying to navigate the crowd will quickly try your patience. This lack of sufficient dining capacity is a major, major miss for a hotel this popular. 3. Daily upkeep. On our first night (Monday) we ordered room service. Once finished, we placed the tray outside our door as people normally do and rang room service to have it picked up. The next morning, it was still there. And guess what? It was STILL there the next morning. The tray sat there until 11:30 am on Thursday and it was joined by no less than 2 other trays down our hall section (both there for more than a full 24 hours). That's just unacceptable. Not even the maids acted on it. Imagine the pest problem that could lead to. Inside the room, there was an obvious white stain on the red coverlet on the bed. Any maid paying attention to what she was doing would have noticed it and replaced it with a clean one. We called and asked for a replacement and never got it. We removed it from the bed and each day we found it placed back on the bed after the room was cleaned, the stain still as obvious as ever. 4. Prices. For room service, a burger/fries and two soft drinks came to $28... and gratuity was not included (as most hotels do). Complete and utter rip off of the guests, especially when the same meal at the cafe or burger brasserie is less than $16. 20 oz bottled soft drinks? $3 each. 10oz glass bottled soft drinks from the mini-bar? $4. 5. The 31st floor lounge. Huge rip off. $45 a day for two guests gets you whole/sliced fruit, croissants, toast, coffee, juice and some less than edible smoked salmon for breakfast. For evening, you get cold cut finger sandwiches. Glass of wine? nope. That's not included. Save yourself the money. Have a 3rd in your party? It's $10 per extra person per visit. All in all, I just felt totally taken advantage of at Paris and not well cared for or appreciated. I've stayed at most of the larger properties on the strip, and I won't go back to Paris, except maybe to play and to eat at Mon Ami Gabi. It's such a shame. There's a ton of potential and you WANT to like the place. At the same time, you leave feeling like you paid far, far more then the value you received for it.The food really isn't very good and the service is terrible.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Let me begin by saying I am a Starwood loyalist. I am a seasoned traveler. I stayed in this hotel a few weeks ago and hoped the bad experience might soften before I wrote the review. But whenever I think of that hotel, I think about my lovely relaxing get away from New York, as ruined by this experience. I went the weekend AFTER the SuperBowl, so you would think Westin property a few blocks from the stadium would have it's act together. Also the fact that this is a HUGE convention hotel. OK, convention hotels are not always the swankiest, but usually very service oriented. This one gets zero circles for service. First I had a rental car. When I pulled up at about 11 p.m., there was no valet/bellman/doorman who came out. I waited awhile and even honked my horn. It was a snowy night and I was nursing a broken ankle. After about 10 minutes, I had no choice but to lock up the care and hobble in. They said they only had one bellman on duty and he was helping someone else. One guy at the front desk also helping someone else. I was given a room with a burned out light in the bathroom. So I called downstairs. They couldn't tell me when maintainence would come up, so I asked if I could just change rooms, since I hadn't even unzipped my suitcase. So it took a while, but they come up with a key for a new room and floor. It was fine. As I started unpacking, I heard a lot of noise in the hallway. I waited about 15 minutes and it seemed to grow more. It was now midnight. I opened the door and I saw kids sitting in the hallway and drinking...show no signs of leaving. I said how much longer are you going to be out there, and they just looked at me. I called downstairs and asked if they could intervene. They said, Well a fraternity has booked the hotel, so there is not much we can do. I said, OK, do you have any floors without a fraternity party going on? They said they would move me. So I waited. and waited. I called down and they said the bellman was on his way. He never came after about 15 minutes. Back downstairs and the poor front desk guy, still alone, helping others. At this point, I am distraught. Bad ankle, tired from a long flight, and hungry. He put me in a room he said "where the pilots and flight attendants stay." The poor alone bellman tries to help me move. He was very sweet, but I said, it seems only three people are working tonight, you, the front desk, and the guy on the phone. And he said, pretty much. I couldn't believe it...the hotel is huge and they were nearly booked as it was the weekend before Valentine's Day. I got to the room, it was fine, no view, but it was quiet. I unpacked and called room service, nearly 1 a.m. now (wasted all this time getting to a decent, quiet room). They only had a few items to offer...nothing hot. And really cheap wines (well, I could see I am not at the W!). I asked how long it would take and they said 45 minutes. So it would be nearing 2 a.m.. It was near 0 outside, so they sent me to the attached restaurant, which was nice enough,and they were closing up, but took pity on me and had some bar food which was hot which I carried up to my room (very glamorous!) I then went to take a shower and the "heavenly shower heads"...only one worked so it was not so heavenly. The bathroom was smaller than most in New York and the lighting was very dim. The towels were super thin (definitely not heavenly), and there were only one bath towel! Then went to sleep in the so-called heavenly beds, which felt just like any old hotel bed. Nothing special about the linens either. The next morning, I went to use the phone by the bed, and it did not work. Had to get up and go over to the desk. I called down to ask for a manager to share my experience and see if I could get these items fixed while I went out for the day. They said they don't have a manager until 1. I said ok, can I leave a message for him? I was doubtful that they took the message, I went to the front desk on my way out (there is no concierge at this hotel)....again waiting in line, although there were now 2 people at the front desk. I told my person a little bit of my story, and she was very rude. I left my number again with her for the manager to call me on my mobile So, the entire day, no one called me. I got back to the room thinking there was a message, and again,none. The shower was not fixed, nor was the phone. The sheets were not changed. Even though I put the little card on the bed that said "change the sheets." When I left the hotel, I will say there were a few more people at the bell/valet stand than at night. But when I stop to ask them for the best directions to the location (only about 7 miles!), it was if I had asked them how to get to Memphis. They totally could not give me directions...didn't seem to know the streets at all. Very odd. They asked if I wanted to talk to a manager, and I just laughed and left, using my Google map on my cell phone...difficult to use as the roads were slick. When I returned late at night, I experienced the same problem with no bellman/valet. Had to turn the car off and come in. Same thing at the front desk...one lone guy. Well only one more night of this. When I checked out I stopped by the front desk just to be sure they had my entire bill, including valet (which incidentally they did not as I was charged for that a few days later). Again a very cold staff at the reception desk. This is not the Indy I remembered. I finally said, are you interested in my Westin experience at your hotel? The woman seemed a little shocked. She asked if I wanted to speak with a manager. I said yes, but it would have been nice to have someone to talk to DURING my stay, not as I am checking out. I left my cell phone number if they were interested in my experience. I will tell all who read this review to beware of this hotel. It really gave me a poor view of downtown Indianapolis after all the hype. As far as staying in a Westin...never. To all who may be forced to stay here, just know this is a very old property with some renovation in public areas. The rooms are clean enough, but very dated. Bathroom is so dimly lit, you need to put on your makeup in the bedroom (so bring some extensionn cords). In terms of my rating, if there were an option for no circles, that would no circles too many.My vegetable risotto was burnt, and infused totally in a burnt flavor.The 2 good things I found at this hotel: 1) LOCATION - You can walk to Universal City Walk within a few minutes. 2) Palm Restaurant is pretty good. Now the bad things I found: Arrival/Check-in Upon my arrival, it was rainy and I saw a sign to self-park. I followed the sign and parked the car expecting that I would enter the lobby level or at least a level with elevators or a covered walkway to the lobby. To my surprise, there is no elevators and I had to drag my 2 pieces of luggage across the parking lot in the rain and up 3 levels of wet stairs. When I checked in, they gave me 2 keys and 1 of the keys didn't work and checked me in a double-queen room when I asked for a King bed room. I went back to the front desk and told them that I requested for a King bed and the lady at the counter told me that my request was noted but it would not be guaranteed that I would get a King bed. They didn't tell me that when I booked the room. Some hotels charge a higher rate for a King bed than a Queen or Double Queen. It was a good thing that I traveled by myself and it was not a big deal. When we travel as a family, my 2 young kids like to sleep in with us (which may or may not be the best idea) but that what they like to do especially on a trip. I would have been really upset if I were to travel with my family. I later found out from another supervisor that they only have 4 King bed rooms in the entire hotel (that what he told me when he came to my rooms to discuss some other issues which I will share shortly below). Cleanliness (or should I say "DIRTINESS?") / Services/Conveniences DIRTINESS: After checking in, the first thing I noticed was a small bathtub with a filthy shower-head (the chrome shower-head is now in black color). I lifted up the sheets and there were some small black particles and even hairs! INCONVENIENCE - POOR DESIGN FOR BASIC THINGS This was a business trip and I had my work cell, personal cell and a laptop. I tried to look for place to charge all of these and another surprise, there is no outlet/place to plug in any thing around the nightstand between the 2 queen beds. Even their own alarm clock and lamp are plugged into the wall outlets behind the headboards that are not accessible. There is one duplex outlet on one wall of one bed and there is none for the other bed. I had to unplug the lamp to plug in one of my cell phones and the laptop and had to plug in the other cellphone on another wall that is not reachable from the bed (which means that if I either get a call from my personal phone or a work phone early in the morning, I would have to get out of bed to get to the phone or if you travel as a family and have other gadgets that you need to charge, you have to unplug some items to get other items charged). I have stayed at other much cheaper hotels where the electrical outlets are either on the lamps themselves or at a very convenience location. THEY TOOK SOME OF MY ITEMS THAT I COLLECTED FROM MY ROOM After going back from a trade show and stood in some long lines to get some freebies for my kids, I took them back to the hotel and left on the table. The next day I came back, I noticed that some items were missing. I picked up the phone to call their 'Star Service' number and there was no dial tone on the wireless handset. I walked to the wired desk phone and some of the buttons were sticky and worn out. I reported that some of my stuffs have been taken from my room and I gave them the benefit of the doubts that they might have mistakenly removed them and didn't report to security when the supervisor offered for me to do so. The house keeping manager called and left me a message a few hours later. The next day one of the front line manager called back and tried to address the issue. After all the issues that I reported, the only thing she offered to me was to find some replacement for the missing items (that would not be the same as what I collected). At least any other hotel or any service oriented managers would at least offer some incentives (such as discounted rate, complementary meal or some thing to keep the customers happy without the customers asking for it). They have no idea how to provide customer service. BACK TO DIRTINESS: On Thursday night, I took a shower and was about to use one of their bathrobes for the first time during my stay, I took the bathrobe out of the closet and there are few piece of rices on the bathrobe!!!! That means that never wash the bathrobes and put in the closet for new guests. How disgusting is that? I started to wonder whether they wash the towers or not. It's probably not a good idea to use bathrobes at any hotel from now on. I was too tired to deal with it and called the front desk the next morning and spoke to another manager. I asked him to come to my room to show him the DIRTY bathrobes and the chrome shower-head that had turned into a black shower-head. He found them to be disgusting himself but didn't really offer much until I asked for some incentives or discount. He offered future discount if I would bring my family back there in the future! I was thinking to myself, 'are you kidding me, you think I am going to come back after this experience?' I pushed the issue and he finally discounted the last day. Overall Overpriced, DIRTY and poor service. This is my worse hotel experience and I will never stay there again. Expect to pay $15/day for self-parking and ~ $25/day for valet (that is without tips). You don't even get wireless or internet access for free for a really expensive price already. I have not written any review before but I found that I have to write this review to share with people who may consider staying there.The waiters ALWAYS look angry and even ignore their high-tipping regulars.After three previous positive experiences at the Gaylord Palms our recent stay from December 30, 2006 until January 3, 2007 was, in a word, terrible. Our check in was anytime after 3:00 p.m. so we arrived at 6:00 p.m. to start our four day New Year's vacation. Within "just a few minutes" our car was unpacked and taken off to the valet parking lot (at a rate of $17.00 per day). After "just a few minutes" of waiting in a terribly long line at the check in counter, due to a terribly understaffed reception desk, we were assured that our room would be ready in "just a few minutes" and we would be called on our cellphone. After wandering around the hotel atrium (which after 4 visits is not as terribly impressive as the first time you see it) for over an hour with no call, we returned to the front desk to see what was taking so terribly long. There, after waiting "just a few more minutes" for a second time in a similarly terribly long line, the terribly exasperated young man at the reception desk assured us that it would "just be a few minutes" more and we would be finally called. After "just a few more minutes" than that, we finally got our room. When I informed the young man that we had checked in our luggage at the bellmen's station ($10.00 tip) "just a few minutes" after our arrival, but well over an hour earlier, he assured us that a bellmen would bring our bags up to our room in "just a few minutes". Within "just a few minutes" walk across the lovely atrium gardens, we finally arrived at our 7th floor suite (7331) in the Emerald Bay section (at a cost with tax of over $300.00 per day). Every call to the bellmen's desk was answered with the response "your luggage will be there in 'just a few minutes' ". We patiently waited for 45 minutes and then left wearing our same travel clothes, since our luggage had yet to arrive in our room as promised, and we had dinner reservations in the hotel restaurant in "just a few minutes" at 8:00 p.m. We arrived after "just a few minutes" stroll across the replica of the "Castillo de San Marco" at the picturesque mock sailboat floating Sunset Sam's Restaurantat promptly at 8:00 p.m., only to be told that our reserved table was not available, but if we would go wait in their bar section it should be available in "just a few minutes", and our beeper would vibrate and flash. The four of us proceeded to the neat looking bar where we each ordered a drink. Since I was terribly disappointed at having to wait for a reserved table I had two single malt scotches. Within "just a few minutes" we had spent $80.00 for two rounds each but since we had neither felt any vibrations nor seen any flashes, we proceeded to order appetizers at the bar. Even though we were assured by the nice bartender that it would only "take a few minutes" to get our three plate tower of cold seafood (at a cost of $40.00) the order didn't arrive until we were taken to our table over one hour after our reservation time and "just a few minutes" before our entrees arrived at the table. When we saw bread on all of the nearby tables other than our own, we inquired of our waitress if we could get some for ourselves. She returned to our table after "just a few minutes" only to tell us that they had run out of bread "just a few minutes" earlier. We finished our meal and paid the terribly over-priced bill ($178.00) for the terrible service and returned to our room hoping for a better tomorrow. Unfortunately, to our terrible surprise instead of a restfull slumber, we were suddenly awakened "just a few minutes" after 8:00 a.m. to Christmas music blaring from loudspeakers. This terribly loud barrage of nonstop Christmas selections continued on all day until "just a few minutes" before 10:00 p.m. I never thought I would resent hearing Christmas carols like "O Holy Night" and "Gingle Bells", but after 10 or 12 hours of listening to this music blaring through our terribly poor sound proofed room, I felt like Manuel Noriega in Panama who had American rock and roll music blared into his hideaway until he finally surrendered to the American troops. I found myself aligning with the likes of Ebeneezer Scrooge, the Grinch and saying "Bah Hum Bug!" as the day progressed and the music continued unabated. Keep in mind that Christmas was five days earlier and we were on the eve of a New Year by the morning of the 31st. I was ready for Frank Sinatra's New York New York and Dick Clark 's Rocking New Year's Eve, but instead I got Andy Williams, the Chipmunks and Charlie Brown's Christmas for fourteen terrible consecutive hours! Even my kids complained when on the morning of January 1, they were awakened by the same terrible barrage of Christmas music "just a few minutes" after 8:00 a.m., when we had gone to sleep "just a few minutes" (relatively) earlier. Enough already with that crap. It was enough to convert me into a Jehovah's Witness. I tried to make it up to them but the $80.00 that it cost to see the ice display that took "just a mere 10 minutes" was a terrible disappointment. The next day I did salvage the vacation by treating everyone to the wonderful Canyon Ranch Spa, where a massage and a facial for the four of us set me back a mere $1000. The total hotel bill with brunch at the buffet and dinner at the quaint Old Hickory Steakhouse was a whopping $3100.00. So next time, "just take a few minutes", shop around, and ice this place from your list, because at a rate of nearly $1000 per day you can go to the Bellagio, a Ritz Carlton, or a Four Season and get terribly good service at a terribly reasonable price.My wife and I stayed here - - or rather, didn't stay here, depending on your interpretation - - during a 12-day trip through Europe in October of 2011. We landed in Paris for one night before setting out for England and Germany, and for that initial night, used the Renaissance Place Vendome, which was outstanding. Based on reviews here, and the relatively low cost, we decided to stay at the Ares for three nights on our return to Paris to close out the trip. We just narrowly averted disaster. First off, if you do decide to stay at this place for some reason, be sure to get detailed routing info to the hotel from the hotel via e-mail. We didn't, and the cab driver took 10-15 minutes of trial and error and mapreading to find the very small side street upon which the hotel sits. Check-in was fine, about what I expected for a boutique hotel in Paris, where I've traveled before. The staffer at the reception desk was polite, but certainly not overly welcoming or warm. There was no offer of assistance with luggage, which, again, is to be expected for this sort of property. The elevator is absolutely tiny and not for the claustrophobic. The room cleanliness and overall appearance was exactly what I expected based on the TripAdvisor reviews; very pretty linens and drapery, huge bathroom with a window, plenty of space if you understand the general size of Paris hotel rooms. (Some reviews here say the rooms are small - - they aren't, not for Paris anyway.) Immediately, however, we noticed the distinct musty odor of cigarette smoke, which was disappointing for a nonsmoking room. I figured that the A/C would take care of it, and went to activate it, but found that I couldn't. I went downstairs to ask the staffer at the front desk what was wrong, and she told me (not rudely, but not very apologetically either) that since it was "so cold" outside, she had disabled the A/C for the entire hotel. This meant that there was no circulated air of any kind inside the room; no heat, no A/C, no central fan blowing uncooled air from the vents. As we continued our discussion in French, she told me that "in winter, there is no air conditioning." I'll grant her that it wasn't 80 or 90 degrees F outside (it was about 60-65 during the day and maybe 50 or a touch lower at night during our visit), but October isn't winter, and there's a difference between "no air conditioning" and "no central air." Both my wife and I have mild allergies and we need some sort of air circulating - - particularly if there's a lingering air of cigarette smoke from a recent guest. The staffer's solutions were to tell me to open the windows and to offer me an ancient-looking fan to carry back up to the room. The window solution was out of the question, as the Ares has large windows with no screens, and we weren't trying to deal with insects and perhaps even a bird in our room. The portable fan, of course, was unacceptable. I told her that this probably wouldn't work and that I would be back down soon to let her know. She said that was fine. I returned to my room, and my wife and I thankfully located a room at the Renaissance Arc de Triomphe (which was far more expensive but wonderful) for the remainder of our stay. We left, having sat in two of the chairs and logged on to the high-speed Internet. We were at the property for just over an hour. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, the front desk staffer was totally rigid and unwilling to waive the night's charges. She told me archly that I should have e-mailed the hotel in advance, and she would have readily told me all about the coerced deactivation of the air conditioning. I told her that wasn't my obligation, and since the hotel claims on its website that it offers air conditioned rooms, the hotel needs to live up to that promise. I simply didn't understand why any guests who didn't want A/C couldn't turn it off in their rooms, leaving any of us who did want to have some air moving around with that option. No dice! (I suspect the A/C might have been broken, but if so, she certainly wasn't telling.) In any event, although she had not taken my credit card upon check-in, I certainly didn't want to break any laws, so I handed it over and she happily charged us for the full night's stay - - about 350 Euros. She offered no apology and (even though we had seven bags) did not volunteer to call us a taxi. We walked to one of the nearby major streets, got a taxi, and went over to the Renaissance, thankfully enjoying it thoroughly regardless of the far greater cost. I followed up directly with the hotel by e-mail after returning home a few days later; they didn't even bother to answer me. No refund or reduction in the price was made, and the full charge appeared on my credit card statement as I expected. I realize that a lot of TripAdvisor registrants wouldn't care about this sort of situation, and a lot of people wouldn't want anything to do with air conditioning in Paris in October. Completely understood. However, the point of this review is not really in the details but in the big picture - - the Ares is fully prepared to mislead you about at least one of their claimed amenities (two, if you count the "no smoking" room that wasn't), and if you complain, they won't do a darn thing about it, and in fact will blithely ignore your request for a refund or price reduction later. So, if you're prepared to take that risk, the hotel is well-maintained and in a nice, well-located neighborhood once you find it - - just hope that you don't have any complaints! And, of course, if you like to have air circulating in your room during a "transition" month like October, April, or May - - forget it. Naturally, I will never stay at this place again. In fact, this experience has sadly soured me on all Paris boutique hotels. I'll be sticking with full-service establishments going forward. With the Ares, you definitely get what you pay for - - or in our case, you pay for it even if you don't get it. Lowest possible recommendation. Everything a hotel should not be.Like all Hotels and places to stay there are negatives and positives so lets start with the negatives. The coridors are in desparate need of a revamp, even a lick of paint would make a huge difference. It appears from the ceiling tiles there have been some leaks, this must contribute to the damp musty smell. With the pool being in the main part of the building there is an elemnt of clorine smell around. Not brilliant whilst having breakfast. The second problem with that is people come out of the poolk and straight into the eleventors making the floors sometimes slippery. Please be mindfull if you are unsteady on your feet. Next the room, Room 7034 is an inside room facing onto the dining and pool areas. Although not the best view in town it's acceptable, being inside and with mirrored glass makes the room dark and always requireing some of the lights on. The fridge is in the base of the TV cabinet which like the table and the cabinets in the bathroom require replacing. The shower curtain rail requires fixing properly as it is curved over time it had become unscrewed and now hangs down so the curtain moves to the middle not good when the shower is at one end of the bath tub. Housekeeping., Initially yhr housekeeping was accectable but as our stay progressed it deteriated dramatically. Let me give you some examples. Dirty towels left as if they were clean ones. We requested a bed change part way through the stay, leaving as requested the "you help the enviroment" sign on the bed. I'm not convinved it was changed. Our room's bin had not been cleared for 3 days and room service had not been in for 2 days. We know this as the bed in particular we had left made but not fully straightened out under the main cover. In a way it was a way of checking if anything was done properly. I had to complain as to me this is not acceptable, The day I made the complaint to reception they had not been in even to replace the coffee and cups. The toilet cistern has not been wiped down for a long time as there are marks on the top and the side that we tried and could remove quite easily. In the main sleeping / sitting area the corner floor lamp hasn't been dusted, wiped or cleaned in quite some time given the film of dust / muck. It may seem that I am being very critical but these points of hotel housekeeping are just basic fundamental ones. The day I complained regarding the 2nd days none room service the excuse was that we had the do not disturbe sign on the door, even though we were out of the room by 11am each day, poor excuse for poor housekeeping. I eventually had a quick meeting with the general manager ( sorry can not remember his name) explaining my concerns and disappointments pointing out that as a regular traveler and frequent hotel guest I regularly read and write reviews for this site and others and would most definatley be putting a review on his hotel on this occasion. I did offer for him to read what I had written so far and before I was to publish it. He said no thank you and was sure that what I was about to put would be honest and true. I did also explain that the previous review of the hotle I was hoping that they would turn out to be untrue but unfortunatley not so. He agreed to give me some recompence for the poor service we had received and he said he would be speaking to the housekeeping manager that day to ensure that the problems were put right. True to his word he did and although there was some improvement and they made the pillows look all fancy etc there was still the dust, still the mucky marks in the bathroom but coffee and cups were of sufficient supply. As we were checking out the following morning early on I could not be bothered to start again. I would have thought if a hotel guest had complained they they would have made a concerted effort even just for that once. Now that rant is over I have a couple of thing to be aware of. 1, Phone calls from the room, I made 3, two of which told me that I had to put a 9 in front of the number I was dialing, these totalled each $3.77 + tax full total $13.02 and a final call to a house I could have driven to within 15 minutes door to door that cost me $11.93 total $24.95. It would have cost me a lot less to have driven it. Apparentyly 1 - 2 two towns away is long distance. 2, The bar area, we tried it one night, to us it didn't feel appealing or welcoming now maybe thats because we were the only once in but still id dint feel like a bar atmosphere again with the smell of the pool. We have both filled out the customer survey cards for the hotel and I now wonder if it is going to change in any way. Out of curiosity I will keep reading any further reviews. Would I stop at this hotel again? I very much doubt it unless there was significant improvement. As always I keep an open mind and very rarely say never again. Would I stay in another Ramada? well yes as I have in the past in USA and NZ and the UK. Some say you get what you pay for but I have been in cheaper hotels and got far better service. It's not or should not be what you pay but what you get for your money that counts. I look forward to seeing if the General Manager puts a reply on this review. I hope so for the benefit of other potential travellwers and Hotel guests. NOTE. AFTER 15 + WORKING DAYS THE DEPOSIT AND THE MONEY AS REFUND HAS STILL NOT BEEN CREDITED INTO MY ACCOUNT. It does specify that it would be after 10 working days. Positives, Great central location for all the theme parks and the I4 to go west or east although don't expect a great night life. The 192 has all the shops you need for a stay. Look around and pop into Celebration for a feel of the Desparate Housewifes. Old Town has some sort of entertainment on every night of the week. Fri & Sat Muscle car and all American car shows. Bike shows and others. Back to the hotel, The hotel bed was fantasticly comfy and the pillows just the right sort of firmness formme and my good lady. The bedroom size was good and the bathroom was of an accceptable level. Don't leave it too late for a shower or bath, water goes cool fairly early on. The amount of storage space was adequate with enough hangers for two people. Good to have an Iron and board in the room even for those tidy bag packers. TV is a good size, If youn arrive by vehicle there is adequate free parking, however durung summer or busy periods I am sure that would get tight. I hope that this review will be of use to all those people thinking of using the hotel and look forward to the comments from others and the staff concerned.I am pretty amazed after reading the positive reviews on this website and visiting the Marriott firsthand. Did no one see what we saw? I must say that I will never book anyone in the Marriott, San Juan especially but probably not the Condado area as well. Here's why. First off, be forewarned that construction in the San Juan area (including Old San Juan and Candado) is rampant and EVERYWHERE - as are the problems that come along with it in any city, namely; traffic, noise, congestion. If this statement alone is enough to make you question San Juan as a place you'd like to vacation peacefully - trust your instincts and book a hotel at an alternate location in PR outside of the San Juan city area (Dorado, Isla Verde or farther) or choose an alternate island in the carribbean. As for the Marriott itself, and I am AMAZED no one has really made a point of this, THE HOTEL ITSELF IS UNDERGOING A 4 PHASE RECONSTRUCTION ON THE WEST END AND ON THE PROPERTY IMMIDIATELY EAST A HOTEL IS BEING BUILT THROUGH 2006. This means that unless you want a view of a construction site, your only bet is the middle-back of the hotel that overlooks the pool. Now if your room assigned does not have a working balcony as a result of the work being done, you are entitled to 5000 marriott points per night or a $100 food and beverage credit per night (sign upon checkin). This means that if you stay on the West side of the hotel where they are painting and renovating the outside and therefore your balcony is locked for safety and out of use, you are entitled. Unfortunately, if your balcony is functional (as was ours, although it overlooked a construction pit and 2- 100 foot cranes to the East. I am sadly not kidding), we did not apply for the credit. Of other notes, our room was 2-3* quality, so be forewarned the high stars given on tripadvisor are indeed misleading. While I understand the level of sophistication is generally not as high in the Carribbean as it is elsewhere, the reality is our room was not the usual Marriott quality (ie. clean, comfortable). A 4* hotel does not have mold growing around the caulf of the tub, our bedding looked shabby, the bathroom needed a desperate regrout, and our balcony had cheap plastic furniture that looked about 10 years old. I could deal w that - after all, how long are you really in a room? But After speaking to the manager and explaining we were not informed of the construction when booking the hotel (which is right next to the beach - you MUST be able to hear it when outside during the day), I was still not offered ANY type of compensation or apology because I was 'upgraded' to a room with a balcony. An insult, to say the least, being our balcony overlooked a pit and construction cranes. I responded by informing the manager the hotel booking policy of not informing guests of the construction, and then not compensating those they deem 'unaffected' is not good business and I would not recommend such a property to my clients. To which I was told to my amazement 'that's fine, do not book your clients here'. Which leads me to ask - if this is the way the hotel manager treats an agent, how would he treat a poor client ? This is not to imply that the manager's attitude prevails in terms of the rest of the Marriott employees - that would be unfair. But when I go away on vacation, I expect a few basic things - namely, clean sheets, a clean bathroom, and a quiet place to relax and read a book or nap. Unfortunately after an hour at the Marriott, it seemed clear to me none of these things would happen without an excruciating effort that would defeat the point of my vacations. So I cut my losses and I checked out. As for the pool, we never swam but it looked very nice. The beach we never made it to so I cannot comment. The casino was a typical hotel casino (a bit smaller than I expected). The lounge bar was very active however the music was too loud (and I like music!) to hear the person next to you. Be forewarned there is a 'resort fee' or $10 a day and also a daily parking fee of $18 per day if you decide to stay here. As far as the Condado 'strip', we were told of the many nice restaurants on the outside of the hotel but we walked the strip and found nothing other than local 2* joints. Not that that is ever necessarilly a bad thing - but just as I expect the cons of a city (ie. noise, traffic, etc), I expect the pros as well (more sophisticated areas, better dining, etc). I am a 26 year old girl and I would not have felt safe walking alone had my boyfriend not been there to be honest. (There is a little, shady strip club across the street and 5 doors down from the Marriott). All in all, I must say that I recommend no one stay at this hotel or Condado in general. The city of Old San Juan is not very big and there is no real benefit to staying near it - the traffic is horrendous, there is construction everywhere, I assume there is rampant poverty as we saw a ton of shanty areas and 'for sale' signs, and even strolling down the streets you will be continuously bombarded by people in their cars and on their scooters playing excessively loud music. (I live in Manhattan and don't need to leave the motherland to enjoy that). If you do go, you can see El Morro and el castillo and enjoy lunch or dinner and some shopping around all of Old San Juan in half a day. As far as nightlife, we were only in old San Juan for a night, but didn't see many options other than 5 or so nice restaurants. (So if nightlife is your thing, this is not your place - go to South Beach, Cancun, stay at Atlantis, etc). Most resorts outside of San Juan do not charge their guests parking and by the time you add up taxi fees and tour transportation charges (for example, if you travel to el yunque (the rainforest), it is $50 per person for the bus tour, a cab from the airport to Candado is $15 each way). Therefore, my strong suggestion is to rent a car and just get out of San Juan - stay elsewhere on the Island. We ended up at the Hyatt Dorado which was lovely - I will post a review for that. Hope this helps give you a more detailed view of the Marriott/Condado area.After extensive research before we came to Las Vegas we finally decided on the Vdara hotel as most reviews on Trip Advisor and other sites reported it was very quiet but still relatively close to the strip. When we got there we were upgraded to a room that overlooked the Bellagio fountains, absolutely beautiful view and room, we were so impressed. We were delighted with the quietness of the room as we were booked for 5 nights stay, and so excited that we couldn't hear any noise from neighbours at all. After some exploring we came back to our room looking forward to a great night's sleep as we were very tired having arrived from Australia, after going to bed at approx 11:30pm we were awoken at just after midnight with an increasingly loud throbbing bass noise, not quite believing what we were hearing and thinking this would just stop, we persevered until approx 2am when we finally rang the front desk to see if they knew what was causing the noise and asked if there was a nightclub in the hotel we didn't know about. They assured us that they didn't have a nightclub in the hotel and other guests had also made complaints so they were sending a security guy around to locate the noise. 3:00am the noise had still not ceased and had almost doubled in volume, we rang again, we were told that they were still looking for the source of the noise. My husband couldn't sleep anyway so he thought he would be helpful and go for a wander on some of the floors to see if he could locate the noise for them, but all the hallways were quiet. The noise finally ceased at 4am, after very little sleep we brought this to the attention of the front desk the following morning who were very apologetic and assured us that it would have been another guest having a party within the building and that 'those' people normally only stay 1-2 nights anyway. They gave us $50 worth of resort credits as an apology and said they would move us to another room if it happened again. Next 2 nights were quieter so we figured it was sorted and were happy. Friday night the noise started up again, once again we waited until 1:30am until we complained they promised to send security to search the floors to find the noise, nothing happened and the noise continued to rise in volume to the point where we could hear all the words to the songs, my ear plugs didn't even dull the noise. After ringing again and being told we were apparently the only guests who could hear the noise we gave up. 4am the noise finally stopped. Saturday night, same again, but this time we were so tired with no sleep we started ringing at approx 12am, they sent a security guy to our room to hear the noise, he was lovely and promised to go around the hotel to shut the noise down and assured us that they take parties in the hotel seriously and although they are happy let people go to a certain extent once someone complains they have to do something about it he stated it would take him approx 20mins to find the noise. Nothing happened and no word from security either so at 2am when the noise had increased agan in volume we rang again to be told by a different operator who answered the phone that many other people had complained and that 'yes it is just the noise from the Cosmopoliton Hotel's Nightclub again', it was the first we had heard of this! At 3am it was still loud so my husband went down to speak to the front desk and was advised that they were still trying to find the noise when he mentioned the Cosmopoliton hotel nightclub they were vague and non committal so he asked if we could move rooms but told they had none available as it was the start of spring break, at 3:30am we finally rang the front desk and security again and they admitted that it was the Cosmopoliton nightclub but the Vdara were powerless to get it shut down despite a large number of Vdara's guests complaining, 4:00am noise finally ceased. Exhausted we checked out to go to our next destination. Bitterly disappointed with our stay at Vdara it appears that the cause of the noise was the Cosmopoliton Hotel's open air night club on all the nights in question according to an admission from one of the front desk staff, and that the hotel did know this all week. Why not just be honest about the situation instead of blaming it on the poor other guests having parties when they weren't??! We had to wait until our last night to find this out, if we had've known we would have gone to another hotel after the first night. To top it off we went to book some tours only to find our credit card had hardly anything left on it, after ringing our bank we discovered Vdara hotel had taken an authorisation for over $650?? As we had pre paid all accommodation and resort fees we were stumped as to why this would be, hotel staff finally admitted that they take a very large authorisation as it is Vegas and people do tend to have parties, we asked why we weren't told this and were told we should have been advised of this when we checked in. Obviously we were not told, even though we specifically asked Zachary, the guy who checked us in, he stated 'oh we just take the credit card for incidentals and things...' every other hotel we visited were quite happy to be honest about how much they were taking as an authorisation and it was normally about $50-100 in total. To the credit of the person who checked us out on the final morning, he did go to lengths to have the authorisation released from our credit card quickly for us and kept his word so that was good. We are just an average late 30's professional couple who saved very hard and spent thousands to go for our first trip to th USA, although we made the decision to enjoy our visit to Vegas despite the lack of sleep and the hotel room and view was beautiful, next time we will not be returning to the Vdara or recommending it to anyone.Who is giving this place 4 stars? I have never written a review before. I travel a lot, but I have never been more compelled to warn fellow travelers. Room DOES NOT look like any promotional photo I've seen anywhere. Where are the rooms in the pictures? I literally teared up when I saw the room and realized we wouldn't have time to change hotels before we had to get to an event we came to town for. I asked the bellman if there were some other rooms that had been renovated and maybe my room was one that had not? He said it had been renovated a year and a half ago? I asked if there were any nicer rooms or if they were all like mine with dirty carpet, walls, etc. and he said they all looked like mine, but some rooms on higher floors had new headboards. Um, the headboard was the least of my concerns. Out of fairness I would try to balance this review with the positives, but as far as the room is concerned, there were not any. I will post some pictures which pretty much speak for themselves. We wore socks the entire time, i used a dog blanket from the car instead of the duvet which had no cover on it (and i'm sure is not regularly washed), i took a shower standing on a towel! thank goodness i had some anti bacteria wipes in my purse so I could use the remote control and wipe down a few things. I don't drink, but i had a drink with dinner in the hopes i would pass out and not have to think about how grossed out i was sleeping there. Check-in was a pain too. We checked in at 5pm. i reserved 2 beds. Didn't want to share a bed with my mom, thanks. I reconfirmed the 2 beds a day or 2 prior. Get to the desk and they want to put me in a king. I ask how long the wait might be if we decide to wait for a double room to become available? She doesn't know. I ask if a room is expected to be available that night? don't know. then she says they are "low" on double rooms. They weren't even out of double rooms and shes giving me a hard time. So I asked if I could have one of these available rooms and she had to ask a manager. that takes a bit of time. the people behind me are annoyed. i think there was only one other person at the front desks. So finally we get the room but really, what are they holding on to the rooms for? Obviously this was no VIP room they needed to keep open. A little more about the room before i sign off-- no duvet covers on the very thin, beigh/tan comforters. At least with covers, you kind of feel like there's a chance they wash those every once in a while. But I doubt these comforters are washed regularly just because it isn't practical and especially in a place like this. Carpet spotted, stained and dingy. Dreary color scheme. brown, tan, off white and then there is the nightmarish abstract "art" on the walls. just black and white splatters. Very cheerful. Not. Really brightened up the room. not. I just looked at the promo pics again. they show rooms with duvet covers, throw blankets at the foot of the bed, reading lights in the headboards, desks, desk chairs. My room had NONE of these things. How's that for bait and switch. Somewhere in the written hotel description they use the word "tranquil". Um, no. The fact that there was some sort of band playing outside until 2am is not the hotels fault, but they also shouldn't imply that the noise from the city is magically blocked out. They do not have any special noise reducing windows, etc. I have no idea where the music was coming from, but from the 35th floor I could make out the lyrics word for word. It was that loud. I'm really sooo disappointed. I do not understand how a hotel gets away with such a bait and switch. I book a lot of travel for people at the financial company I work at. I'm so glad it was me that found out about this hotel. If I had sent my bosses to a hotel like this, there would be repercussions. The room really affected the quality of my trip to NYC. While we were away from the hotel, I was dreading going back. And even though I'm home in my nice clean house, writing about this is even giving me the creeps. 6/30 - It's 2 weeks later now and the experience still bothers me every time I think about the trip. I did my research before booking this hotel. I saw photos. My mother rarely travels and so I wanted her to have a nice time--not to have to worry that she forgot and almost got out of bed without putting socks on before her feet touched the floor. I emailed the concierge about 7-10 days ago to ask for an email address of someone in management that I could forward this review to. I have not received a response, but I'm not surprised. Just today someone asked me about that trip (FYI Millennium, she also books tons of corporate travel to NY) the first thing out of my mouth was how horrible the hotel was. Last week I booked travel for some of the people in my office. The hotel they normally stay at was booked and they wanted something close to our offices in NY and near enough to the park for jogging. If I had a good experience at this hotel, I would have booked it for my Team in a minute. So on top of leaving me with a bad memory, the hotel lost out on a 3 night stay for 7 people. 21 rooms. As well as any future business my office could have given them. Hope the money they save by not cleaning, getting rid of ripped sheets, changing ruined carpets, removing spider webs, etc. is worth the money, the loss of business, and their reputation. I will never stay at The Millennium Broadway New York or any affiliated hotels again.But I can't, because it seems they don't want my entertainment dollar. I had a large group travelling to Las Vegas, from England, for a wedding and hoped to have after-dinner drinks for the Bachelorette Party at Parasol Down before heading to one of the nightclubs at the Wynn. I searched online for a telephone number for Parasol Down, but could not find a working number anywhere. Eventually, I called the resort's main number and asked to be transferred to Parasol Down. The less-than-friendly Operator asked, "Are you in the hotel?" I replied that I was in another State, but wished to speak with Parasol Down regarding a possible event. The Operator then replied, "You can't call them if you're not in the hotel." I again told her I was not within walking distance of the hotel, but wished to plan an event, and stated that surely there must be another way to reach them, as this same scenario must occur on a daily basis. She said there was not another way to reach them. She was very unpleasant during the entire call, and acted as if I was crazy for wanting to arrange an event over the phone and for calling from somewhere other than the hotel. I don't live at the Wynn or Encore, and I doubt the majority of their guests do. I thanked her and left the line. I had actually started making other arrangements involving other Vegas Strip locations in my mind by that point, but couldn't get the thought that she was wrong and very rude out of my mind. Obviously Steve Wynn wants people to come to his casinos, since he talks about it non-stop while one is on the websites, while one is on hold calling either Encore or Wynn, and on the little t.v.s in the taxis one takes around town, etc.. Maybe he should also advise the staff that visitors are to be encouraged. I thought it about long and hard enough, that I decided to give them another chance. I have been a player at the Wynn on many occasions. I belong to their player's loyalty club. I find the space beautiful and really wanted to delight the ladies in our group with a trip to Parasol Down, which is a lovely little bar. I was also looking for a special bottle of Champagne for the bride, but opted not to mention this until I had an actual venue arranged. So, I called again, the same main resort number. I got through to a much more friendly and more professional Operator the second time. She advised me they actually had an Entertainment Coordinator who worked with groups. Imagine that! She asked the size our group and then told me our group was just on the cusp of the size the Entertainment Coordinator would work with, but she would ring me through with the possibility of having some questions answered. As I was on hold, listening to Mr. Wynn talk about all the fabulous service one would experience if they just came to his hotel/casinos, I had to giggle a little. My giggle turned to further frustration as I listened to him tell me about the fabulous restaurants and dining experiences, followed by the fabulous (inaccessible) nightlife, by the time he had rambled through information regarding the amazingness of shopping at the Wynn (approximately 7 minutes later), I decided I wasn't being transferred. Eventually, (I'm going to say 12 minutes or so after I first called...long enough for me to get in some serious complaining to my husband and advise him not to take the Bachelors anywhere near the Wynn or Encore if they wanted to plan ahead) another operator picked up the phone and asked for whom I was holding. I told her I was waiting for the Group Entertainment Department. She put me back on hold, for a shorter time (just long enough to hear Steve mention that one can "have 'THE' fun" at Wynn/Encore, confirming my suspicions that he is indeed just rambling on those recordings and not following any sort of script whatsoever) Group Entertainment's answering machine came on. I left a message. Anyway, they did call back rather quickly, which was a nice surprise. When I told them the size of our group, they pretty much said there was nothing they could do. I asked if a table could be reserved at Parasol Down and was told not only no, but that our party might not even get in that night if it was busy. It was then I decided officially not to mention the bottle of Champagne in which we were interested. After wasting an entire afternoon of my time, Wynn didn't deserve our business or our money as far as I was concerned. We ended up booking after-dinner drinks at another Strip casino, an employee of which made a special and extensive effort to find the bottle of Champagne we were looking for. I know it's crass to mention money, but here I go, just to say that the tips alone that night equaled multiple thousands of dollars. I just want the Wynn/Encore to consider what could have occurred if things went differently from the beginning. What if they booked us at Parasol Down? Found and provided our Champagne? Treated us with excellent customer service? If that had happened, seventeen other people could be telling all their friends and family to stay at the Wynn/Encore when they go to Vegas right now. If those things had happened, I would probably seriously be considering taking advantage of the complimentary night's stay offered by Club Red via email today, and tacking on an additional 3 or 4 days to make it worth the trip of course. Sigh. If only... Unfortunately, I can say with certainty my Vegas dollars will be going elsewhere from this point forward.My husband and I just returned from the Westgate Town Center "Hotel" which we stayed at from February 12-February 17, 2012. We booked this through a hotwire deal that you couldn't see the hotel you were booking, but it would be a hotel similar to a Hilton, Hyatt, Wyndham, Westin, or similar. We have stayed at these other hotels, so we know what this type of experience should be. After we processed our selection the Westgate Town Center Hotel came up. We had not heard of it, but we were willing to give it a try. We started to do our research, and realized it was a timeshare condo type of place. A hotel in our opinion is much different than a timeshare condo. You know what to expect at the hotel (toiletries, cleaning service, beds, etc.), at a timeshare condo (or Villa as they call it) you have no idea. I made a call to Westgate to find out a little bit more before our trip. The phone number reached an central answering service, not the front desk of the hotel. The person did not know specifics regarding the place we were staying. This was concerning, but we were still willing to give this place a try. She told me we would be booked in a "studio" (again, this is not a familiar "hotel" type of stay) and the studio had a King size bed and a couch area. I asked if we needed to bring shampoo/conditioner, towels, etc. She did not know, but put me on hold and told me that the first shampoo/conditioner would be complimentary, but we would have to supply the rest. We also saw that we would be charged a resort fee of approximately $10 per night for amenities at the resort. The listed amenities were transportation to Disney and Universal, exercise facility, VIP services, ticket desk, internet, mini mart, game room, etc. (28 amenities listed on the site). At one point, we called hotwire because we felt that this listed as a hotel was not accurate. They said there was nothing that could be done. Now on to the actual trip.... We arrived around midnight because of a late flight. **note bring your itinerary to show the gate person so you can get it. We had ours, but this could make getting access difficult.** The front desk process seemed to go smooth, but the person at the counter claimed not to know anything about any of the amenities and services and said to come back the next morning (this was after having us fill out whether we were satisfied with her attitude in some sort of survey thing they give people). Although we mentioned several times to different employees through our trip that we had never been there, nobody explained any of the amenities to us or where to find things that we had paid a "resort fee" for. She gave us our room keys and sent us on our way through the giant compound known as Westgate. We arrived at our room and upon opening the door we found that we had two beds that were maybe full size. The bedding was scratchy, the room looked outdated, there was a mocha colored weird looking blanket, a loud continuous fan sound (the air was off), and a giant window that looked right into the room from the public walkway. There was no couch area. Here is a summary of what else we experienced (off-peak season): - Unfriendly service, no information when we arrived and everyone we talked to at VIP services was rude. - Definitely not a "hotel". - Not the same caliber as a Westin, Hilton, Hyatt, etc. - Fridge was broken - Air conditioner was okay, but loud - Walls very thin - Scratchy low grade sheets (I even had a burr in my bed that poked me for 2 nights before I figured out what it was). - Resort fee never mentioned by staff. Just given a fee summary at checkout. Also, they take a $50 deposit in addition to this at the beginning of the stay for incidental. - Cleaning service did not vaccuum. Only seemed to replace towels, which were small and poor quality. Definitely did not wipe down the bathroom floor either. At least not when we were there. Maybe this is the policy. Not sure since nobody ever explained anything about this "hotel" to us. - Security staff were the friendliest out of everyone we encountered. - The transportation to the theme parks is confusing. There are limited spaces available and you have to sign up for them ahead of time (at least a whole day) at VIP services. We went and signed up and the girl did not explain where to pick up the shuttle, how to get back (when I called to verify how we get back the guy that answered kept saying "it's on the sheet". They circled the departure time, but they did not circle anything for return. There were two times listed and a bus location number, but no directions. On the bus, the driver did not explain either. We found out that you bring your sheet to your departure driver (hang on to it!) and then you bring it with you again when you want to leave and stand at the location indicated on the sheet and show it to the return driver. They will not let you on if you do not have it. - Discount tickets are only available if you are going to a park for more than 1 day. It is worth buying them from hotel though if you do not wish to stand in line at the park. In order to get the discount you will need to sit through the timeshare speech. The ticket salesperson was helpful and nice and did not make us sith through this because we were only going one day. - Pool area near our room in the 5900 building was decent. Needless to say, the experience could have been a lot better. We were told very different things and provided comparisons that were not even close. This place might be decent for families though, but not for a couple looking for an easy get away. We would not do this again.Ice Water in Hell We stayed at the Occidental Grand Punta Cana 8/5/06 - 8/12/06. Let's first say that, I read all the negative reviews and decided to be open minded and take a chance. Boy am I sorry. Let's start at the airport. We flew First class on NW6168 into Punta Cana. We filled out all the required papers before arriving at the airport. Because we were First class we were one of the first passengers off the plane. We thought that was a good thing. After arriving into the airport we had to stand in line to buy a Tourist Card for $10. No one told us this, I just saw a guy in a booth and asked him what I needed to do. After that, we waited in another line over 30 minutes. As we got closer to the front, we noticed that people were filling out more paper work. Well, the 4 papers we filled out on the airplane were the wrong COLOR. Same paper but not BLUE, so we both had to redo all the same information. After that, there is a guy who takes the $10 Tourist Card, we just bought 40 minutes earlier, and we are allowed to get our luggage.Well, as if that wasn't enough. We're looking for VIP Transportation, which we booked directly through Occidental. No one knew who we were and said we couldn't have flown in on Northwest. So I finally realized that, although our ticket was booked on Northwest, it was actually a Continental Airlines flight. Who knew that made a difference? Once I gave them a Continental Airlines flight number they were willing to talk to me. Meanwhile, I'm showing them all my receipts, confirmation information, etc, but that made no difference. So 30 minutes later, they put us on a bus. After sitting down for less than 5 minutes we were asked to get off the bus. We were told we'd have to wait for the next bus. By now we're pretty --- off, and decide to take a taxi. He assures us we will wait only 5 more minutes and he was right. The driver loaded our bags, I showed him our receipt with the hotel name and told him there were 2 properties and which one we were staying at. Well, I guess it was our fault as well. Because we let him drive off before verifying we were at the right hotel and had to pay a taxi to drive us 25 minutes away to the right one.Now for the hotel. We stayed in Building 24 room 314. It was midway of the beach and theatre where they had live entertainment every night. We requested 1 king bed and were told that because we didn't get there untl 5pm we were stuck with 2 doubles pushed together. The toilet didn't work and although we reported it several times, no one ever came to fix it. It would flush properly every 2 - 3 flushes. Well, that may not have been a big deal if we both hadn't gotten sick off the food by Day 3, and had to spend much more time than anticipated in the room. On Day 2, I had an allergic reaction to something at dinner and was on Benadryl all week. I was covered in hives and a word to the wise. Bring allergy medicine. I'm 41 years old and have only had a food allergy once in my life. I've always been able to eat anything I want and never had to worry so this was very surprising to me. Needless to say, I was somewhat prepared and had brought 3 tablets, just enough to get me through the night until the store opened. A box of Benadryl costs $32, so I guess it is a hot seller at this hotel. All week, we would try a different restaurant and still end up back in the room sick. Not quite the way we pictured our first romantic vacation as a couple together. We were extremely dissapointed and tried to make the best of a bad situation. As far as the room, it was very dated but clean. We only had hot water 3 out of 8 days. We had to take cold showers the other days. I guess we were lucky because we met a couple who didn't have ANY water from noon until after midnight. The picture on the TV wasn't very clear and some channels wouldn't come in at times. We had read the reviews and knew to bring washcloths, which was a good thing, We also tipped the maid every day and it never made a difference. Some days we had to go find her because we hadn't received any towels and/or beverages in the fridge. Everyday we left a tip of at least a dollar along with asorted toiletries which I had read they really appreciate. Good luck, but it did nothing for us. All in all, I can honestly say this was the worst vacation I've ever been on and I am well traveled. I've been to Germany, France, Korea, Maui, Oahu, Kona, Jamaica, Cancun, St. Kitts, Antigua and the Bahamas. And I've never had a problem with the food . I also nne dto add that if you don't speak Spanish, you will have difficulty at this hotel. We tried to get a wake up call and couldn't. Maybe we called at the wrong time but it happened several nights. They seem to know English when it is convenient, but only speak Spanish if you have a problem.My wife and I decided to break away for a quick vacation to playa del Carmen, knowing full well that an all-inclusive hotel wasn't going to be the Four Seasons. Still I was shocked at the food, the rooms, the service and dishonest management...oh, and the sewage smell pervasive everywhere at the BlueBay. First the food, as it was the worst foul. It was inedible. Upon arriving we were told we must make reservations to the "restaurants" otherwise dinner could be had at the general buffet. The first two nights all restaurants were full so we were stuck at the buffet. It was inedible. I wasn't expecting gourmet but the food was worse than elementary school cafeteria boiled meat and fried whatevers. We vowed to avoid it even if it meant skipping meals (which we did). We finally got into the restaurants, where you could at least eat the stuff (though hunger was primary reason for doing so). We had one meal at the Asian restaurant and one at the Mexican. The staff had told us that the restaurants alternated every other night. This meant that our third night we would have to brave their version of seafood. Thinking this was a dangerous game we simply went to the Asian restaurant (which was supposed to be closed). They ended up seating us there after much fussing. Again, the food there wasn't good but we knew at least it wouldn't make us sick. Our last night in the restaurant we watched a newly arrived couple take a first bit of their meal, shudder in disgust, and then just get up and leave. Welcome to Paradise! Another annoyance in this category were the drinks. They were nasty. Everything liquid smelled of poo. I know it sounds crazy but something in their bar system was contaminated that made all of the drinks taste like sewage. Any mixed drink, margharita, coke, even sometimes the water tasted like sewage. We pointed this out to the bartenders, who admitted it was a problem, but then did nothing about it day after day. You would think a resort would be concerned about this. But no here. In BlueBay paradise poo is on the menu and you had better learn to like it. So we stuck to bottled water and canned Coke. Even if there hadn't been sewage in the drinks it's doubful they would taste good. It's all bottom barrel rotgut. And the beer - the only one available - is the Mexican version of natural light (no offense to natty light fans). The staff claims that it is Dos XX. I looked on the keg. It's not. That would cost too much. The rooms. When we finally got to our room it smelled horribly of mold and sandlewood. They had tried to use the latter to cure the problem of the former. Obviously it didn't work. The mold was coming from the waterlogged concrete floors which not only produced eyewatering allergins, but were the perfect breeding ground for swarms of Mosquitos. Within 10 minutes both my wife and I were coughing and swatting biting flies. Ahh, the romance. We called the front desk to ask for a room change but were told we would have to wait until the morning. There were as many staff as Mosquitos, so who knows why we had to stay the night there. What's more troubling is that the hotel HAD to know about the room's condition. Any human with a nose would have been repulsed by it. And yet they still thought it was fine to rent it out. So, the next morning we got up early - we hadn't slept - to go change rooms. The staffer with the magical power to give us a new room didn't arrive until 9, though. She happily agreed to change our room but said we had to look at a new one first. I tried to just take the new room, which was on a higher floor so would not have the mildew problem, but they would not relent. Did I mention the hotel lobby is set over a mile away from the rooms? So, off we went with a staff person in a golf cart to look at a new room. Only he dropped us off and drove away without telling any of the service staff to let us in. So, we trudged the mile in the heat back to the lobby to get the key and made the round trip one more time. After three hours of this stupidity we finally settled into a non biohazzard room around 1PM. Oh, in the middle of all of this they had the gall to hassle us constantly to buy a time share at this godforsaken hellhole. That aside, onto the service. "just wait a little bit" should be Blue Bay's motto. Bottom line the guests were seen by staff to be a nuisance. "oh, your Coke tastes like sewage? You should call the cocacola company." It's not necessarily the staffs fault. They haven't been trained. The management just hands outthe uniforms and tells them to go hang out in their respective areas of the hotel. I could go on and on. This is undoubtedly the worst vaca of my life. Just horrible in every respect. Want to hang out in the pool at watch the sunset? Too bad. It closes at 7 every day. Want a drink that doesn't taste like poo? Maybe better luck tomorrow. Want a room that isn't saturated with water and probably raw sewage? Call us tomorrow. Hungry? Hope you like prison cuisine. Don't think this is coming from some prisspot. My alltime favorite trip was trekking through the Iraqi and Turkish desert via public transport w/o air conditioning. In August. I don't need feather beds and chaiwallahs to have a good time. But I feel completely taken advantage of by this horrible place. Once you are there and have paid your (rather expensive) all inclusive fee upfront it is like you don't exist. They lie to you to get you out of their hair, serve you the lowest possible quality food to make an extra buck off of you, and don't even bother picking up the trash off the beach. Blue Bay is a Spanish owned company that is only interested in cashing your checks. They don't care if you come back. The only good thing i can say about them is that they refunded my money for the nights that I didn't stay there. If you like poo-flavored mixed drinks, will stay so drunk you won't notice the dog food and more Mosquitos than a Joseph Conrad novel...and are looking for scads of Sasquatch-like fat, hairy eurotrash in thongs (men and women) then BlueBay is for you. If you don't want those things then avoid this trap like the plague (and you might even be able to catch the actual plague in this place). Awful awful awful.I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people.I'd rename it the 'Do it yourself' resort! We just returned yesterday from the Ocean Bavaro and although we had a good time, none of it had to do with the hotel or the accomadations provided to us.Americans Welcome? I dont think so. Nobody understood english very well. There were barely even any english speaking guests to converse with. Here is a breakdown of our week.1st - we arrived at noon and we were told we could not check in until 3. We were not offerred a drink - a cold towel or any of the usual welcoming things that a resort offers. We were pointed to the restaurant and they said we could get something to eat. When we asked for a room to change into a bathing suit they pointed us to the public bathroom. We had to dig through our luggage on the side of the driveway and drag our stuff to the bathroom to change. In the meantime, we watched other spanish speaking people walk in, given drinks and cold towels and rooms to change. We were finally escorted to our room - which was filthy. I wouldnt bath my dog in the tub. when you sat on the toilet you could see under the sink which was plywood written on by prior guests. We went back to the front desk (15 minute walk) and were given a better room. In the 100 block - which was nicer but very far away from everything and with a 3 year old, that makes life very tough. I wouldnt advise that anyone excepts the first room given to them. It seems they try to give you a bad one to see if they can get away with it first. Every time you have a problem or need assistance you are told to walk to the front desk (this is a 10-15 minute walk from our rooms). And then when you get there they dont understand what you are saying and you are left standing there for 15-20 minutes. Our room key kept losing its activation and we would be locked out of our room. We would have to run back to the front desk every time. It was frustrating.Then, nmy husband was calling me nightly at 10:00 from the US to check in with us. He could not get through. He would ask for my room, he was transferred 3 or 4 times then disconnected several times, every night. I had to call the front desk and their answer to me was, come here and talk to us. After what seemed like hours! I finally was able to find someone to understand me and recognize that I was going to get a phone call every night and when I do, they should transfer the call. He still was hung up on every night and finally just stopped calling. I couldnt even get a phone call in!The beach was dirty. Plastic bags in the ocean wrapped around your legs. Seaweed everywhere. My 3 year old would not even go on the beach. Said it was yucky. I somewhat agreed. We found ourselves cleaning up the beaches.The pools were dirty too. First, they opened at 9 and closed at 7. To me this is bizarre. I have stayed in many resorts all over the place and not one had a time limit on when you can swim in the pool. The workers came out and cleaned the pools at 8 am. My daughter was up at 7 and wanted in the pool by 7:30 and we couldnt go in. The pools were not cleaned very well at all. The same garbage you saw the day before still floated even after the men attempted to clean. Filthy. We found ourselves cleaning up the areas we were in.The food. I am still sick at the thought. My daughter had a fever and was going to the bathroom non stop the 2nd day. By the 3rd day my mother was doing the same and I still am today. The thought of having to eat the food they served one more day is enough to make me want to vomit. I cant even think about it without feeling ill. I lived on bread and spaghetti with a prego like tomato suace. And snacks I brought from home.The service was do it yourself. get your own drinks - get your own food - get your own everything. They dont tell you the amenities at the resort, you have to figure it our yourself. They dont tell you whats going on or the activities, you have to figure it our yourself. The so called 24 hour nurse or doctor service is not free. When my daughter became feverish I wanted to run her by the staff nurse and I was told at the door $60.00. I went on the internet and got the answers to the questions that I had concerns with.The gift shop is a rip off. WATCH YOUR MONEY. They tried to charge me on a number of occassions $11 (that seemed to be their favorite number) for a bag of doritos, a push pop and a piece of gum. A woman employee once came to my rescue and I thought, finally! an honest person! On the last day of our visit she told us her home was robbed and she needed money, she mentioned having a small child and all of their clothes were stolen, we offerred to give her some clothing of my daughters and she only wanted the money. Although I wanted to help it was hard to believe after all of the dishonesty we experienced and I would find it a terrible shame if this is an ongoing scam that this worker poses on everyone. I am not a wealthy person and I save every penny I had this year to take my daughter on this vacation. They seem to think that you are american you must have money to spend, or money for them to steal. I would recommend being educated on Pesos and Euros before entering that gift shop.AND the worst. THe racism is apparant and insulting. Spanish speaking people were treated better. Given upgrades special treats. More respect. Americans were laughed at. Taken advantage of and simply made fun of.There was a restaurant about 20 feet from our rooms. This food was noticably better. More selection - better selection. In order to get into this restaurant you had to be a vip or come from an italian travel agent. Something bizarre which was never fully explained to us. If a common guest went into this restaurant they were told to leave! Then a family we met said they were told it was ok to eat there (they were of dominican decent) and another family we met, spanish speaking, they were told it was ok to eat there. When we asked the front desk we were told you had to be from a certain travel agent in order to eat there and we were not. and we were pointed back to the common area.Disgusting.Even our trip home was horrible. Our flight was at 1:00 - our airline said to be there 2 hours before. We prepaid with our package for transportation back to the airport. They told us they could only pick us up at 9 am. We had to sit at the airport with a 3 year old for 3 hours. We asked them to come later and they laughed at us. LITERALLY laughed at us. I think the service was Turnitad. HORRIBLE. Would I return to the dominican? certanly. But I would not go to this resort ever again nor would I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good vacation. It was frustrating, insulting and dirty.Horrible experience - stay away!The hotel is in the perfect downtown place to see the city, it looks lovely inside however do not be sucked in!!!!! We were 2 friends male and female travelling together, when we arrived we were met by a lovely man(Quenten) booked us in gave us our room perfect - then we opened the door - we had a kingsize bed!!!! no other bed at all in the room and since Im a married woman and my male friend is gay this was totally unacceptable! Right back down to reception and explained the situation - we had booked a queen queen room which we believed contained 2 queen size beds? Yes thats what the room we had booked was however the hotel was full and they had no other rooms to offer us!!!! the nightmare began!!! There was no roll away bed to offer us and the best he could do was give us extra bedding so my friend could sleep on the floor!!!!! We paid for 2 beds and my friend had to spend the night on the floor - great start!!!! We were assured this could be easily sorted out at 9am when the manager was back in Next morning after a very uncomfortable night for my friend on the floor we went at 10am expecting to be able to speak with the manager - was met by a very hostile receptionist who informed us of 3 different time the manager would be in work. when i questioned she had given me 3 different times, without even allowing me to finish what i was saying she shouted at me - erm i thought we were the guests in the hotel and they were providing us with a service??? We were given another room at 11.30 however still didnt see the manager of the hotel until about 2.30pm and then our niightmare really began. She told us we got what we paid for - we were really shocked since we were holding a booking confirmation that stated we had booked a room with 2 beds - OK the manager said we have sorted it now whats the problem? even more shocked now we explained we had paid for 2 beds and only received one, she then said she would speak to Bookit.com and see if she could get us a refund for the night we only had 1 bed - ok we thought thats fair enough and we went about our holiday. The next morning we got up late and went down to reception about 10.30 to see who were had been told was the manager the day before however she was sat in the lobby on a sofa talking to someone - so as not to be rude and interrupt her we decided to go out and see her later, however as we reached the door of the hotel she looked up and shouted across the hotel "Bookit.com said they would refund you 20%" I was so embarrassed by this outburst in front of other guessed I just said "thank you and left" however when we spoke to Bookit.com later that day they said they didnt say they would refund anything. We were feeling quite upset by this time and decided to contact Best Western Customer Services who informed us the person we had been speak to (the manager) was not the manager at all so things got worse - we got the name of the General Manager of the hotel and spoke to her and then things really did get bad. She screamed at us on the phone to check out of the hotel - oh my god I really couldnt believe this was happening and really believed there was no way things could get any worse however they did. After the General Manager had told us how sorry she was for what she said the very next morning there was a banging on our door like there was a fire in the building since we had put the "do not disturb" sign on our door we really did think there must be some sort of emergency that someone would bang on our door so loudly and with the sign there. My friend opened the door and a woman burst through it and right away began shouting at me - I was in total shock and had no idea who this woman was! I asked very calmly excuse me who are you? she informed me she was in fact the General Manager and wanted us out of her hotel by 11.30am at this point it was actually 11.45am when i asked why she informed me that I had complained that the iron in the room was not working right!!!! We choose to ignore this person however it did have a very big impact on the rest of our stay - we feared to go out of the hotel and leave our belongings in case they were not there on our return, we feared to speak to any of the staff in case this woman became irrational again and our room was never cleaned from that day on - to get clean towels we had to go to reception and ask for them daily and anything else we didnt dare ask for. So if you want somewhere that looks nice on the surface, you get screamed at by the staff and you fear for your things then this is the place for you. However if you want somewhere you will receive polite professional staff then go somewhere else and I have not exaggerated any of this if anything I have not expressed just how bad it really wasStaff and management attitude here is very bad overall. Leadership is abysmal, and is reflected in the outrageous treatment given to the guests by the employees. First, let me say this is a beautiful hotel and there are a few very good employees (especially the people who clean the rooms). However, for the most part, the employees reflect the worst attitudes possible in the service industry. 1. ATTITUDE. NO ONE SMILES. In fact, there appears to be a significant effort on the part of employees behind the reception counter, and in the restaurant, to avoid smiling, even when charming customers from various countries are smiling at them. 2. ATTITUDE. EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT ARE RUDE. Employees behind the reception counter act as if it is a great inconvenience to them to have to listen to a customer. They interrupt before they know what the issue is, and they treat customers rudely. Again, not all employees, but most. 3. ATTITUDE. CUSTOMERS ARE THE PROBLEM. There is no effort to fix problems, but, rather, to make excuses for why they can't be fixed, especially at the management level. The bell hop dropped my computer monitor. I reported it to security and they took a report. I heard nothing more about the incident. The next morning, I walked by a bell hop I believed to be the one who mishandled my monitor. He said something like "two, two, two." I didn’t know if that was a curse, or if he was saying something to the man next to him who was on the phone. It sounded more like a spit than words. 4. VALUE. YOU GET HALF OF WHAT YOU PAY FOR. There are two kinds of hotels. One provides a bed, the other provides a wonderful experience that makes guests want to come back, and to tell their friends. This hotel provides a bed (plus a bad experience). I can't recommend it to anyone. 5. GRATUITIES (TIPS). GRATUITIES ARE MANDATORY, NO EXCEPTION. Gratuities are automatically added to every check, at the bar, and in the restaurant, even for one person. There was no clear answer about the percentage rate of the tip, only that it was “minimal,” whatever that means. This allowed the employees to take a "could care less" attitude, and most did. The occasional employee with excellent social skills gets screwed out of a good tip. 7. RESTAURANT. RESTAURANT SERVICE IS RUDE. Waiters walk away while the customer is ordering, the music playing is most inappropriate, and is set to produce the familiar echo of over-amplified third-world radio stations. When I asked one waiter if the tip was included, he quickly said it was included, grabbed the bill and my credit card and disappeared. The two numbers at the bottom of the check that looked like they could have been tax and tip weren't labeled, and seemed way out of proportion. He didn't bother to show me the tip, or tell me how it was calculated. The only thing that came back with my credit card was the receipt for my signature. I was in a hurry, so I didn't question him on it. It made me feel like he stole from me, even if he didn't. 8. BAR. THE BAR IS BORING AND FRUSTRATING (BECAUSE OF THE STAFF, NOT THE GUESTS). I was at the bar for about an hour one night. There appeared to be two bartenders. One was constantly away getting food for the bar, while the other sat in a chair at the bar doing paperwork. The two employees appeared to be at each other throats. The bar was full, and people were upset that they couldn’t get service. But why should the bartenders provide service when their tips are automatically included in the bill? The bar environment would drive any employee crazy (and the customers hated it too). There was disco music playing from the PA system and a loud TV playing in the lounge area of the bar. It was the most pathetic bar experience I have ever had. 9. COMPUTER ACCESS. SOMETIMES THE WIRELESS NETWORK PROVIDES PLUG AND PLAY ACCESS. I was given a wireless network bridge to attach to my computer so I could use the wireless network in the hotel. This is a free service to customers with computers. For 8 hours I worked with the people providing bridge service via a 1-800 number. Most of the time was spent waiting on them to get back to me. Finally, they had me change out the equipment at the desk, and that solved the problem. They guy behind the desk said "you should have just brought it back right away." That wasn't helpful or fair, since one of the people at the desk told me to make the calls to the support company. 10. VENDING. THERE ISN’T ANY VENDING. I went to floors 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18. Those are the floors with soft drink machines. Not one of the machines worked (see pics). This was reported to management on the first day I was there, and it was that way when I left. On the last day, I bumped into one of the bell hops in the elevator, and even he knew there were no soft drinks to be had from the vending machines. The hotel manager whined that he could only advise the restaurant that the machines needed to be filled. But why should the restaurant fill the machines that charge $1.25 for a soft drink, when they sell the same soft drink from a refrigerator in the restaurant for $2.00, plus never having to work to keep the machines filled? The boutique/store in the hotel is forbidden to sell soft drinks. 11. HOUSEKEEPING. HOUSEKEEPING IS GREAT. The housekeeping staff did a marvelous job. They were very friendly and courteous and the room always looked great. Out of 5 stars (5 being the highest), this one gets a 1. The housekeeping staff kept it from getting a zero. It could have been amazing, but it wasn’t even mediocre.If you are wanting any kind of customer service, this hotel is not for you. My mother and I have been to Playa del Carmen 3 or 4 times before this trip, and we both agreed, this was by far, one of the worst experiences we have had in Playa. From the beginning at checking into the front desk, the staff was not very helpful with information about the hotel and provided us with only one piece of paper that was a faint copy of hours for the two restaurants (which one of them you had to make reservations for and some days it is open and some days it wasn't-although the sheet of paper never specified days it was closed". Our travel agent booked us a non-smoking room with 2 beds. When I asked if it was two beds, the front desk said no, it was a king but for $20 more a night, we could upgrade to a room with 2 beds. We said we would wait to see the room before making the decision. When we entered the room, it had an overwhelming smell of smoke and had ashtrays in it. We asked the bellboy about a non-smoking room and he said all of the rooms were smoking. There were not any non-smoking rooms. We asked him to call the front desk about getting us upgraded to the room with 2 beds and he said it wasn't ready yet and we would have to wait around 2-3 more hours if we wanted that room AND it would be $25 more per night (all of a sudden it went up another $5 a night). We decided to stay in the room we had and tried to make the best of it-even though it caused problems with our breathing. The bellboy said he would call someone to spray freshner in the room, but of course, that never came. Don't expect much from the room-there are no hairdryers, has little bathrooms, hard flat beds and our phone couldn't make any local calls and when we called the front desk or housekeeping, it was rare if we got someone to pick up the phone. I had someone from the states call me and it took him 3 times before he could get someone to answer at the hotel so that he could be connected to our room. It does have a small fridge which they stock on the first day with some sodas and water but they do not re-stock it each day you are there. Once we drank our bottled water, we couldn't get any more even though we were at an all-inclusive hotel. We had to buy bottled water if we wanted any after we drank the 2 bottles that were in our fridge in the room. The restaurants and bars only gave you water in little cups and did not carry bottled water. Another thing-the Real Resort website advertises that "Total Access to all Gran Porto Real facilities including its deluxe SPAREAL". When we asked about access to the Gran Porto, the front desk said we would have to pay $35 per person per day if we wanted access to that hotel. So don't fall for the false advertising on their website because ANYONE can buy a day-pass at those hotels. You don't have to be a guest at Real to get a day pass to Gran Porto. Other issues with the hotel: Later during our first night at the hotel, we asked if there were any non-smoking rooms and the front desk said they had some earlier but not any more. They were all full so basically the bellboy lied to us. You have to pay to use the computer to access the Internet, which is standard for most hotels, but several of the keys on the keyboard did not work such as the P, B, N and I am sure others but we got too frustrated to keep working on it, especially after we had to pay to use it. The food in the buffet was not great. It was edible but if you have stayed at other all-inclusive hotels in the Playa del Carmen area, it is very substandard to other hotels' food and their buffets. Their is a Latte machine next to the Cappucino machine, but it didn't work. I will say the Flan was excellent but that is about it. Many of the foods were odd concepts such as the brownish green small turkey legs with hard boiled eggs cut in half and mixed into the gravy, an unrecognizable fish dish, vienna type sausages mixed into eggs (which they called eggs and winnies!), and other items that if they did not have a sign, I would have had no idea what it was. And no champagne for Mimosas in the morning. The water did not work in the sinks in the public bathrooms available to guests at the hotel. One bathroom by the bar had water leaking out from the toilet and spilling all over the floor. Even after we let the front desk know that the water still wasn't working on the second day we were there, we just gave up on it ever working. The scary part is that both of these bathrooms are next to the restaurant and so all of these people are not washing their hands, including employees, and then going to eat at the buffet or serving the guests food. A very nasty environment to say the least. when we asked for change to use the Internet, the front desk was out of change. We asked how long to get to another hotel and they said 15 minutes and it actually took around 40 minutes with no traffic and our cab speeding past other cars. The "spa" is a small hut outside and we never saw anyone there or providing services there. Each night we were there, we had guests shouting in the halls around 3 am or 4 am with no security or hotel staff asking them to lower their voices. The staff at the front desk would consistently answer the phone first and finish that call before waiting on guests at the front desk so you would have to wait a long time if you had a question to ask them. To top it off, they have a computer by the front desk that ask for comments on the hotel. You are supposed to slide your room key to activate the survey. The card reader didn't work and not all the keys worked on the keyboard to type in a room number and therefore the survey couldn't ever start. Areas that were good: The flan was some of the best and there are some hammocks by the pool were very comfortable. The maids and the wait staff were very nice and the presentation of the food at dinner was nice in the Maria's restaurant (when it was open) and there is a 24 hour snack bar which was probably the best thing they had. I didn't think I would ever be so excited about chips and football stadium nacho cheese but after dealing with the food in the main restaurant, it was a wonderful snack to have!! Maybe some of the issues we had wouldn't bother you but compared to many of the other all-inclusive hotels we have stayed at, it was very disappointing. More than anything, the front desk staff was the worst and you just never felt like they ever "wanted" to be helpful. And it wasn't just us, each time I went up to the front desk, there was another guest complaining about something so during the time we were there, there were MANY unhappy guests.The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sausage like the ones that sell for $2.99/lb at the store.LANGHAM HOTEL LACKS PROFESSIONALISM, WE LEFT AND DID NOT STAY THE NIGHT EVEN IT WAS ALREADY PAID FOR! It is my birthday and as a birthday present, my sister got me a room at the Langham hotel to stay the night. I actually wanted to go for a weekend getaway (I live in HK, by that I mean heading to Macau), so I called Langham's reservation and see if I could reschedule the stay for another day. "Sorry sir, as written in the fine print in your email confirmation, there are no refund nor rescheduling allowed." ... so be it. Since the email confirmation said we can park overnight for a nominal fee, my fiancee and I drove and arrived at exactly 5:51pm (stamped by valet), as we get off, I told the attendant that the car will be parked overnight. He looked at me and said it will be charged by the hour. I told him its in the agreement, he said I would have to talk to reservations. There was hardly a line and as I was checking in, I mentioned the parking situation, after the Langham staff saw the confirmation letter, she showed it to her colleague, whom started serving us... by telling us its not possible and the hotel will not honor it... I explained to her that its in the agreement and its something the hotel has to deal with the agency, not the guest... She told me to wait while she calls her manager, after putting down the phone she told me that I can wait in my room while she resolves the issue, meanwhile the car will have a 2 hour free of parking. I said "NO! I am not going to wait in the room for 2 hours while you go check" (what if they come back declining it again?!?!"). She calls the manager again... this time, I told her to get the manager to come out and talk to me directly. She finally comes out, told us to show her the confirmation (it was on our mobile), then told us to send her a copy to her email, she then had her staff go back to back office, check her mail, printed it out and handed it to her, she told me that this is an error with the agency and thus it is not their responsibility to honor it.... I was like... excuses me?!?! I wanted to change the date of my stay, you said no because it states so in the terms and conditions while you have a right to refuse when you don't like it?!?! She then said that I have to go deal with the agency, its not the hotel's problem.... I asked her "is the agency not authorized by the hotel to make reservations and the terms and conditions were pre-agreed between the hotel and the agency?" She said yes. So I demanded that she honors the agreement or let me refund my sister's money or allow me to change the date on my reservations! She said she'll have to go inside to check. I said fine, stood (at the reservations desk) and waited, my fiancee got bored, she left and sat down at the lobby, (in the meantime, their staffs were busy serving other people and simply ignored me, the least they can do is to sit me down, give me a glass of water or something, but nothing!). 20 minutes later (it's 6:27pm, we've been at this for more than 30 minutes), my fiancee came back and said we should just leave and forget it. I asked a staff to let the manager knows that we are no longer waiting and will leave. The manager came back out and she said she had yet been able to resolve the problem. I immediately explained to her that this is no longer my issue. She is either to refund the money to my sister or allow us to change our reservations. She said no because it is stated in the confirmation letter. I went furious! I said "so is the parking!", and LOUD! "The problem is not me, why am I suffering from this, I am the Guest!". The floor manager quickly comes over and offers his help (he obviously knows what was going on), He explains that this is an error made by the agency, thus it is not the responsibility of the hotel to honor it. I told him that since the hotel authorized the agency to take room reservations on their behalf. The hotel must honor whatever is said on the terms and conditions. The floor manager finally gave in and agreed to offer the parking under the said terms. But I told him its too late, I don't want to stay at the hotel anymore, I didn't spend the last 45 minutes standing here to go over something that is not my fault. I am leaving and I'll let someone else stay here at another date. The floor manager disagrees and again brought up the terms and conditions... The conversations got heat up and by this time. I got so loud that the manager asked me to quiet down. I told him its not my fault that I am loud, if he has a problem with it, he should've moved me to a private room for discussion. I kept on telling him (and let people hear) how they're denying the terms and conditions they've set in the agreement and how I am standing there suffering from it. My only guess is that the floor manager finally decided that he no longer wants to deal with me he finally agrees to let me reschedule. I said "that's fine, simply give me your business card and I'll leave!" THIS IS A SCAM! For a very simple reason, when a guest tries to alter any terms and conditions set forth, the hotel will always uses the agency as an excuse to deny the alteration. But when the hotel does not want to honor the terms and conditions, they simply says they will not honor it and the guest should deal with the agency! COMPLETE LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM! First of all, Langham hotel should immediately acknowledge the agreement (and deal with the agency aside), having me stood at the reservation desk for 45 minutes is simply unprofessional. They could have at the very least sat me at a corner and deal with me. But no, the manager went back inside and had me stood there waiting for another 20 minutes. And the floor manager comes out and continues to tell me it is not their fault. This was merely a parking issue and yet I had to go through 4 staff, their entire chain of command just to acknowledge something they've written in fine print. Worst of all, not a single apology, not one! from any of the staff. For creating the hassle that should've never existed. For a mere parking issue, I had to wait in the lobby for 45 minutes, explained my situation that is set by their terms and conditions. Explained it to 4 different people, didn't even get to sit down or offered a glass of water, ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!Purina Busy Bone - A Lethal Product for your Dog.I write this letter after considerable thought and anguish.  On Friday morning, February 25, 2011, I was awakened by the screams of my fianc&eacute;e Lori as she sat on the living room floor cradling Greta, our 2 ½ year-old registered female Pug.  Greta crawled under the coffee table and there choked to death alone on a Purina Busy Bone.<br /><br />I'm left wondering how Purina, a company with a name as iconic as Betty Crocker, Bayer, Gerber and General Mills, could have not only manufactured such a lethal product, but, as I've since discovered on the Internet, has had issues with it in the deaths of other dogs for some time - and not pulled this dangerous item from the shelves.  I find this absolutely appalling.  I'm 57 years-old and I've put my trust in Purina products since I was a child.  And now our beloved Greta, purchased from a breeder as an adorable puppy in the fall of 2008, is dead because of your product.  And Lori, my sweetheart of 32 years, a stroke victim in 2004 and who most certainly can do without this kind of stressful catastrophe; a great animal lover, has had her heart torn asunder.  She's simply devastated - and angry.  And so am I.<br /> Did you know that in the United States its citizens spend more on their pets than their children?  Are you familiar with the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show series which includes the world's finest breeds in competition for "Best in Show," including the Chinese Pug?  Do you have any idea of the loss we've suffered at your negligent hands?<br /> I could talk about the money we paid for Greta from the breeder, and having her spayed (we don't breed our beloved pets; we keep them as loving companions for as long as we can).  And there are the regular check-ups, and shots and so on.  I find it bitterly ironic that the veterinary office we use is within walking distance of the Kroger store from which we purchased your killing Busy Bone.<br /> I have a 91 year-old father who lives alone.  I visit him at least twice a week, sometimes more if time allows.  He certainly appreciates those visits.  But he also has a fulltime companion - Spencer, his Jack Russell terrier.  Spencer will turn 12 in May.  Dad is disabled, uses a walker, is scheduled for heart-valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and has a myriad of other health issues.  Yet despite them he has managed to take very good care of his dog.  And I believe if it weren't for the loving attention Spencer gives dad, he would not be alive today.  His dog has given him something special - the gift of life.  Something which Purina has stolen away from us.  You'd think that Purina would have the same consideration for the welfare of dogs in this country as a disabled 91 year-old man.  But tragically that's not the case.<br /> Yet there's more.  We also have a male pug which we named Winston because he has the same tenacious bulldog features etched into his amazing face as that of Winston Churchill.  Winston, like Greta was, is truly an individual - a soulful companion.  And like us, he's now subdued.  He's actually depressed because his playmate has disappeared and he doesn't understand why.  This concerns me.<br /> I am a professional photographer and writer by trade.  I work with the general public and I have to present a side to it which instills confidence.  Writing, by nature, requires a certain state of mind as well.  As a result of losing Greta, all I can think about now is me handing her a Busy Bone, not knowing that it would snatch her away from us forever a short while later.  The guilt is killing me.  How can I write?  How can I do anything?  Grief passes they say.  But tragic memories remain fixed for a lifetime.  And what makes things worse in this case is that Greta's death could have been prevented.<br /> Though both Winston and Greta liked the Busy Bone, several times in the past Greta had gagged on it.  So, I served her a smaller portion each time, which, after careful observation I assumed resolved the problem.  In retrospect I should have responded more to the concerns Lori expressed over this potential danger to begin with.  In a brief moment, while we were in another room, Greta died because of your product.  And why should such a product even exist?  Why wasn't it at least labeled as a choking hazard?  Why didn't Purina conduct the adequate safety research before releasing this product to the stores?<br /> The answer is self-evident: Gross negligence.  A negligence which has caused the death of not only our beloved Greta and other dogs, but has now indelibly left its mark in Lori's and my life.  We'll never be able to erase the painful images seared into our minds of her lying still on the floor.  I lie awake at night thinking about it now, as well as remembering digging her grave in our backyard through such anguish that even I, a writer, cannot express in words.  It's now the closest we can get to our special friend.  We are utterly distraught.  Greta, only 2 ½ years-old, healthy and in her prime, a wonderful, loving companion, is gone forever.  It's a horrid loss that cannot be replaced - thanks to Purina.<br /> The very least Purina can do is pull all forms of the Busy Bone from the market immediately, and to conduct adequate, responsible research in the future before releasing any Purina product.<br /><br /> Karl and Lori<br /> Former owners of beloved Greta, purebred female pug.  Our baby.  Gone forever.It took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses.menu - uneventful, small.Staff and management attitude here is very bad overall. Leadership is abysmal, and is reflected in the outrageous treatment given to the guests by the employees. First, let me say this is a beautiful hotel and there are a few very good employees (especially the people who clean the rooms).

There is no effort to fix problems, but, rather, to make excuses for why they can't be fixed, especially at the management level. The bell hop dropped my computer monitor. I reported it to security and they took a report. I heard nothing more about the incident. The next morning, I walked by a bell hop I believed to be the one who mishandled my monitor. He said something like "two, two, two." I didn’t know if that was a curse, or if he was saying something to the man next to him who was on the phone. It sounded more like a spit than words. 4. VALUE. YOU GET HALF OF WHAT YOU PAY FOR. There are two kinds of hotels. One provides a bed, the other provides a wonderful experience that makes guests want to come back, and to tell their friends. This hotel provides a bed (plus a bad experience). I can't recommend it to anyone. 5. GRATUITIES (TIPS). GRATUITIES ARE MANDATORY, NO EXCEPTION. Gratuities are automatically added to every check, at the bar, and in the restaurant, even for one person. There was no clear answer about the percentage rate of the tip, only that it was “minimal,” whatever that means. This allowed the employees to take a "could care less" attitude, and most did. The occasional employee with excellent social skills gets screwed out of a good tip. 7. RESTAURANT. RESTAURANT SERVICE IS RUDE. Waiters walk away while the customer is ordering, the music playing is most inappropriate, and is set to produce the familiar echo of over-amplified third-world radio stations. When I asked one waiter if the tip was included, he quickly said it was included, grabbed the bill and my credit card and disappeared. The two numbers at the bottom of the check that looked like they could have been tax and tip weren't labeled, and seemed way out of proportion.

But why should the bartenders provide service when their tips are automatically included in the bill? The bar environment would drive any employee crazy (and the customers hated it too). There was disco music playing from the PA system and a loud TV playing in the lounge area of the bar. It was the most pathetic bar experience I have ever had. 9. COMPUTER ACCESS. SOMETIMES THE WIRELESS NETWORK PROVIDES PLUG AND PLAY ACCESS. I was given a wireless network bridge to attach to my computer so I could use the wireless network in the hotel. This is a free service to customers with computers. For 8 hours I worked with the people providing bridge service via a 1-800 number. Most of the time was spent waiting on them to get back to me. Finally, they had me change out the equipment at the desk, and that solved the problem. They guy behind the desk said "you should have just brought it back right away." That wasn't helpful or fair, since one of the people at the desk told me to make the calls to the support company. 10. VENDING. THERE ISN’T ANY VENDING. I went to floors 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18.

They were very friendly and courteous and the room always looked great. Out of 5 stars (5 being the highest), this one gets a 1. The housekeeping staff kept it from getting a zero. It could have been amazing, but it wasn’t even mediocre.We made a relatively last minute trip to New Orleans the first weekend in May. Being a Harrahâ€™s rewards card holder, I called them to get a room, and, with the Jazz Fest going on, they were sold out, but the best deal they could find was the DoubleTree, right across the street from Harrahâ€™s. This was our â€œmini honeymoon,â€� as we just got married, but weâ€™re not taking our real honeymoon for a while. Harrahâ€™s reservation agent was very excited for us, and noted that it was our honeymoon on our reservation with the DoubleTree so they could do "something special for us" - her words, not mine. When we arrived in town, we waited in line for valet parking for 10-15 minutes, watching two valet parkers come and go, but never being acknowledged. Finally, after I got out, one came to the door to tell us that the garage was completely full, but they could give us a discount coupon for another garage. He told us they have over 300 rooms in the hotel, but only 100 spaces, so the valet sells out, especially on busy weekends. We didnâ€™t overreact, though, since we saw a bunch of kids coming in their prom attire, and knew the jazz fest was going on. Downtown New Orleans parking is tight. Strike one. Leaving our key with the valet so we could check in, we walked into the hotel to find four people behind the counterâ€¦ but we had to wait anyway. When it was our turn, the agent found our reservation very efficiently, and got us checked in just fine. However, she didnâ€™t smile onceâ€¦ it was then that we realized that nobody behind the counter was smiling. No pleasantries, no â€œwelcome to New Orleans,â€� or even a â€œhave a nice stayâ€� or â€œthank you for staying with us.â€� No mention of our honeymoon. We did get the famous DoubleTree cookies, but they werenâ€™t warm at all. The best description of their attitude was indifference. Other adjectives include uncaring, surly, and just plain rude. Strike two. When we got to the room, it looked fine. The rooms are small, and our room only had a queen bed, even though we had requested a king. The furnishings were nice, and appeared to be recently updated. The bathroom counter, as well as the dresser top and coffee table top were granite, the furniture was real wood. The room was clean, with the exception of the TV â€“ it was smeared, like it was cleaned with a dirty rag, and one towel rack in the bathroom is half torn off the wall. But, as another reviewer said, the toilet sounds like a large plane. With engine trouble. Maybe even an engine fire, with a large bird sucked into the engine. Maybe even an ostrich. Also, the walls and doors are beyond thin. When the person in the next door opens and closes his door, you jump because you think someone is coming into your room. And the doors are loud â€“ they close by themselves, and slam when they shut. Strike three. We took this all in stride, since, as they say, â€œevery hotel room looks the same with your eyes closed.â€� Saturday morning, we decided to sleep in. However, at 7:46, two housekeepers were yelling to each other in the hall, and letting those loud doors slam. Strike four. I should have been counting. After we finally woke up (again), we ordered room service for breakfast. It did take the full 30-45 minutes that we were quoted, and it was our server who had the best attitude of any staff we met. She was friendly, smiled, and joked with us. However, my fried eggs were not cooked right, the grits had been sitting and formed a crust on the top, and our soft drink and orange juice were served in the plastic bottles, with no glasses or ice. Strike five. I really should have been counting. After a day of being lazy, it was time to get cleaned up and get out. I started the water for the shower, and noted how nice the water pressure was. Got the temperature right, and noticed that the tub was now alarmingly full, even though the drain was open. I decided it wasnâ€™t that big of a deal, so I pull the diverter knob to turn on the shower, and it came off in my hand. That was enough. I called the care line (dialed 44 on the phone) and was told engineering would be up in â€œa few minutes.â€� After 40 minutes, we called again to be told that engineering was backed up, but he was taking a remote to another room, and would be up in ten minutes. After almost 20 minutes more, another call got another promise. Luckily, he showed up within 5 minutes after that, apologizing because he was on the only one on call for the hotel. He was the second staff member who was polite, and I did feel sorry for him. It took him a second trip to bring back the parts, and we finally had a working shower! Repeated calls to talk to talk to the manager resulted in â€œsheâ€™s at lunch.â€� Left messages for her to call us back, but that didnâ€™t happen. We did get a call offering two free dinners downstairs, two free breakfasts the next morning, and a tin of cookies. We passed on the dinner, since we had plans to go out. Plus, we had eaten their breakfast that morning, so we had an idea what weâ€™d be in store for. The only good news about this stay (besides the cookies) was that, when we went to pay, we found that we were not charged for the room â€“ only internet and room service. Still, no apologies, no, â€œIâ€™m very sorry about the problems you experienced, therefore we wonâ€™t charge you for your room.â€� Once again, the best description you could use for the staffâ€™s attitude is indifference. I present all these facts as just facts â€“ this was a story that happened to me, and that doesnâ€™t mean that everyone will have the same experience. One, two, or maybe even three things could just be a coincidence. (I lost track of how many strikes this hotel had.) However, all these events seem to show a pattern of mismanagement and poor customer service. There are far too many good hotels in New Orleansâ€¦ I wonâ€™t be back to this one. And, Iâ€™ve learned my lesson â€“ ALWAYS check TripAdvisor before you travel!What an awful experience we had at the San Juan Marriott!! My party (husband, my mother and my sister) and I travelled to this hotel during Memorial Day weekend and it DEFINITELY was NOT what we expected!! It was something reminiscent of Spring Break, from the EXTREMELY scantilly clothed guests (which I would get into more detail about but think it wil be best to hold back) to the loud, obnoxious drunk people in the pool, this was not what we envisioned our vacation to be. Now, my husband, sister and I are all in our 20's, laid back and like to have fun, but this was over the top. THE GOOD: To begin, check in was a breeze, and they accomodated our early check in request. The rooms have nice decor - flat screen tvs, comfy bed, they did do a nice job with the renovations. The bathrooms are nicely appointed as well - beautiful marlbe vanity with lots of space to store toiletries, etc. Even though we didnt have an oceanfront room and when you immediately looked out onto the balcony you got an ugly view of this monstrous building under construction, all we had to do was look to our left and the ocean was right there, so that was a nice perk, as well. THE BAD: The surf at this resort is SOO strong and rough you really couldnt be in the water and relax; you constantly had to watch for the next wave to come and take you under. All of the staff encouraged the guests to stay out of the water. Now, when you are in the Carribean, you want to be able to swim in the beautiful, crystal clear ocean water, and we couldnt do that here.Needless to say, we were hugely dissappointed when we discovered this, and after we saw the size of the small pool. Food/drink service on the beach was PAINFULLY slow...I understand the Carribean (been to Aruba, Bermuda and Mexico ) and that your mindset should be to relax, you are on island time thing, but we waited almost an hour for 4 drinks!! We had lunch there at LA VISTA, I believe. Food was decent, but pretty pricey. The restaurant is located right next to the pool/beach so it does have some nice scenery. Our first (and only) time we had dinner at the resort was the BBQ buffet they had beachside...it seemed like a nice idea, but after we paid 24 dollars a person for alot of unappetizing food we realized what a bad move that was. THE UGLY: We were there less than 24 hours and I had to call the front desk 3 times!!!! At 11 pm (yes, that is a bit early, but we had been traveling since 4 am) the room next to ours was outrageously loud and having a party, with a screaming baby in the room, nonetheless. They definitely need to do something about the noise levels in the guestrooms - it seemed as if you could hear everything coming from the rooms next to you and there were no sound barriers at all. The noise was unbearable and we couldnt sleep and after dealing with it for a couple of hours, we succombed to calling the front desk to complain. A few minutes later, through our peephole, we counted 10 adults leave that room. I will say that security did come up after to confirm they broke up the party. 6AM: We were woken up to about 7 girls yelling outside our door. They sounded pretty wasted. As I was calling the front desk to complain (AGAIN,) the door to the room next to ours opened and a gentleman excertingly told the girls to "Shut up." The girls felt the need to respond to him with expletives I wont use, but once he went back into his room. we thought (erroneously) that this escapade was over. Boy, were we wrong. About 10 minutes later these girls returned AGAIN and this time when the guy next room over opened his doors to yell at them again, it turned into a shouting match and the girls threatening to hit him (unprovoked), etc. We watched this unravel through our trusty peephole, for to be honest, we were afraid of what might happen if we opened the door. I called the front desk for the 3rd time and told them they had a pretty serious situation on their hands on the 10th floor and they better get up here. The thing that bothered me the most about this situation was that we never, not ONCE, heard back from the front desk about this situation. They never called or came to our room to see if things had been solved.We barely got a sorry out of them for everything we had experienced our first and ONLY night here. I called up to my mothers room on the 12th floor (who had noise issues the night before, as well, but nothing compared to ours) and we would return to the InterContinental (Katherine at the beach bar rocks!!) in a heartbeat. Overall, we were extremely disappointed with our brief stay at the Marriott. My husband and I stayed at the Marriott Aruba resort for our honeymoon and we were extremely pleased with our stay there, so its not as if we have never stayed at a Marriott before.I've had better Japanese food at a mall food court.Where do I start? we booked this hotel through hotwire and once we found out it was the Westin, we were so excited. We arrived at 12 midnight after a long drive from San Diego to Desert Hill Premium outlet and then to LA.Since we arrived late, we were given a room on the 12th floor. This is considered the executive club level, again very excited. the excitement lasted only a few minutes. We were staying at this hotel for 5 nights, so we unpacked everything( we had also, done lots of shopping at the outlet mall and had bags and bags of stuff, un-packed all those). We entered the room and it was so old looking an the floor was so dirty. By 12:45 I go downstairs to ask if there is a place to get a coffee and the front desk told me that unfortunately there isn't any place available at this time! I go back to the room and start reading the booklets in the room, to my surprise , it says the bar downstair is open till 1:30 and has variety of speciality coffees!!! So i attempted to make coffee in the room, well, the coffee machine had water in it from the previous person, and it would shut off every 30 seconds, so it took me 4-5 attempts to make a cup of coffee. the top of coffee maker was so filthy and disgusting that I had to take a picture of! anyways, i could not get a decent coffee. Then, I went to brush my teeth and noticed the sink is clogged and there is a horrible smell coming from it.( remember, this room was supposed to be cleaned before we got there, not sure how the cleaning staff cleaned there and did not open the water in sink!!). I called the service express and they sent their engineer to check on it. it is already 1:30 in the morning!!! Sonny the engineer comes up( such a great guy) and spent another almost 2 hours in our bathroom. I had to stay up for this whole time, at the end he said it is not fixable and we have to switch rooms,by this time the horrible smell is all over our room, you could hardly breath!b He asked us not to use the sink either, My husband had already fallen asleep so I called the front desk and made them aware of the situation. I told them that we will be changing our room in the morning since my husband is asleep. She said she will call me in the morning to tell me which room is assigned to us.I set the alarm at 7:30 so I can pack everything again and be ready for our 8:30 room change. I got up, packed and went to take a shower , believe it pr not, my body touched the shower curtain and there is a huge nose mucus( BOOGIE!). I almost threw up! anyways, got out of shower as soon as I could, since the water was so cold too! anyways, no one calls until a little pass 8:30 I call the front desk to ask about the room number, well, they had no idea what I was talking about! finally, they said after 12 pm they will have a room on the 12th floor, we packed everything and left for universal. Came back at 11 pm and they had given us a room on the 11th floor. By then I am furious at everything with the hotel. To compensate for all these, they had given us a suite with a terrace but to get to the room, it took you a while to get from the elevator to your room as the room was at the end of a connecting hallway. also, what am I gonna do with a terrace by the airport in December? So I go downstairs and wait in the preferred line to be served! with no one in front of me, it took them 20 minutes to serve me,actually they didn't. I just walked in front of the other line waiting to be checked in. The guy was so rude an arrogant that I had to ask for the night manager, I explained to her what had happened and she was very nice and understanding. At the end, we were given free internet and free valet parking for our whole stay( we had already started using both accepting the charges). Also, there is a coffee stand in the lobby, the only place that serves Starbucks coffee. you go there at 10 am and she says she is closed!!! Also, in the booklet in the room was a list for complimentary things you could ask. I asked for hair spray and a sewing kit and they didn't have either one. also , the cleaning lady did not clean the bathroom floor or any other floor for that matter. I guess they don't vacuum everyday. Just make your bed and put new soap and shampoo! In this trip I stayed at 2 other hotels and they both were amazing( hilton La Jolla San Diego and Hotel Nikko San Francisco union square). This by far was the worst hotel I had every stayed at. Except Jennifer the night manager, Sonny the engineer and another lady/girl at the front desk in the morning, everyone else demonstrate a less than satisfactory service. I Will never ever go back to this place. ever! and make sure no one I know would not go there either.If you have ever stayed at a hotel with any level of solid customer service; Ritz, Four Seasons, W etc. do yourself a favor and don't book the trip. I know it's tempting..it's cheap but the old adage "you get what you pay for" has never been more true..except in the case of this resort...way worse. I won't rehash the problems other guests had with the pools, the beach or the food. I'll just speak to my specific issues. -Upon checking in to our room we were immediately underwhelmed. It was tiny and right next to the "party pool" by the beach. Not ideal for a week with 2 young kids. The safe was also locked. We called maintenance to have someone come open. Guy arrives & proceeds to take out a screw driver, hammer & with one pop, opens the locked safe...not making me feel very secure at this point. The safe issue would plague us all week..had to have guy come 3 times to get safe to work properly (wonder if all the screw driver entries has had any effect?). -I signed up for the Sandos rewards program which allegedly allowed me certain upgrades. I figured I'd go to front desk & see if we could upgrade to a better room. Guy at front desk had no idea what rewards program was. After some back & forth..they agree to upgrade and come by in a couple hours with bell hop to transfer us to other side of resort. -We got to other end of resort & lug all our stuff up 3 stories..open door to a completely unmade room. Wet towels on floor, no sheets. Bell hop gets on phone, apologizes & says they have another room for us. Haul stuff down..into cart..to another building & then up more steps..open door & same damn thing..only worse. Unmade room only this one didn't even have electricity. Bell hop goes to use phone except that doesn't work either. Same deal one more time until finally on 4th try they find a clean room. -Wiped out, we go to bed only to be woken at 8:00 am by a call from a guy who needs to meet with us to go over our stay etc. Annoyed, I said "Look, if I'm interested I'll stop by". Next morning..same thing. He then says "If you don't meet with me I can't guarantee your shuttle back to airport". I go by later to meet this guy & tell him to stop bugging us. He then says "I won't know any shuttle info until tomorrow. It'll be on a white board in lobby, can I do anything else for you?". I said "The only thing you've done for me is wake me up on the 1st 2 days of my vacation". -If you're staying for less than a week you get 1..yep 1 reservation at the restaurants. Funny how that's not told to you prior to the trip. No matter as the food was brutal and all 4 of us got TD anyways. -If you love 50 degree Dos Equis drafts in cheapo plastic cups and bottom shelf liquor, this is your place..as that's all you'll be getting. -They set either trash or cut wood on fire in the middle of the night on several nights filling our room with smoke (doesn't this place bill itself as an eco-resort?). I thought the building was burning down. If any of us had respiratory problems we would have been in trouble. I call front desk & ask if anyone else thinks the resort is burning down. Front desk guy says "Hmmm..maybe guy in room next door is smoking". I would have serious concerns for guest safety if there actually were any emergencies. -Electricity went out every day we were there..in the entire resort. How the hell does that happen? Every time it kicked off the AC which had to then be re-set. Good times at 4:00 am. -The kicker came upon checking out. They give you 4 cards which you turn in each day for a towel. Concept kinda makes sense except the only place you can do this is at the pool by the beach..not at any of the other pools. Why? On the last night our one son got sick on the floor. We used the 2 pool towels we had & called front desk to explain that we had 2 cards & 2 towels & were checking out. Front desk says we have to turn towels in. I said "I'm not walking from one end of resort to other just to get 2 more cards" just to check out..."can we leave in room". He says "No, has to have towels". I explain situation..won't budge so we had to carry 2 vomit covered towels to front desk to check out. I get the impression the management has no concern whether anyone returns. It felt like the place was full of lots of locals who go there for a cheap beach stay. I wouldn't say the staff was rude but rather, seriously under trained, often times clueless. I would have zero confidence in the staff of Sandos of ever handling an emergency situation properly. The area is pretty but the whole package of mediocre food, cheap drink options, poor lodging and horrendous customer service made for a pretty horrible experience. If it would have not been such a huge hassle & costly, we would have ejected early.My husband and I stayed at Animal Kingdom Lodge for 3 nights in March 2005, which turned out to be 2 Nights, because we thought the service and overall stay was so horrible that we left a day early!! We arrived about 7:00pm on Friday and after it took us almost two hours to check in and get our luggage we headed to our room (The room was very dark , had two queen beds and very hot ..the heat was on???) .....we had realized that they didn't give us our park tickets, so we had to head back to the front desk, stood in line again and after about 45 minutes they told us we had to go to the will call window to get our tickets the next day? We also reported that our heat was stuck on and were told that someone would be up to fix it.(you had to leave the door open to breathe) After another 15 minutes or so, we finally got our tickets and headed out to get dinner. I ran up to the room to grab a few thing and there was a girl leaving with our thermostat unit, she said she would repair and replace it before we got back ( she also had 5 other units from other rooms and told me they were having big problems with them that night). There are three restaurants in the hotel, one is upscale, one is a buffet and one is a cafeteria. The Buffet and Upscale restaurant had 1 1/2 - 2 hour waits, and the cafeteria was just that...a cafeteria. Due to the fact that it was very busy at check-in, you were NOT told much. Not where go to take a bus, not where special things where going on, where to get info, etc. It took us about another half an hour to get out of there to find dinner...we ended up grabbing a cab, rather than wait for a bus...we were starving. We went to downtown Disney for dinner, we arrived about a half an hour before the restaurants closed...but we made it! But then we couldn't figure out where the bus picked up to take us back (we had taken the cab, so we couldn't find the bus stop). Finally after walking around the entire place we found the bus stop (quite a walk to get to). We arrived back at our room around 2:00am, and we immediatley checked our thermostat, because it was now frezzing in our room. It was on 65 and blowing cold (it was 49 degree's outside that night)....so we turned it up to 68 degrees and it blew HOT air again....there is NO OFF button so we had to sleep with the patio door open and the heat basting to balance the air?? We were up all night either freezing or sweating...thank goodness for the extra bed, because we had to take all the blakets off it and use them! We actually held our blanket in front of the vent to warm them up because our room was so cold. We finally got up at seven, and just said forget this. We called down to tell them that our thermostat still was not working properly, we asked them to send someone up, as we were going to the park for the day and also to send up extra blankets, just in case! We got back around 8:00 and had planned to changed into our suits and relax in the Jacuzzi after all the walking, we couldn't wait to relax. We opened the door to our room and it was about 90 degree's! We called down to speak with a manager and were told that they would call him and have him call us right away....my husband hung up phone and it rang instantly!!! My husband said hello and the man at the desk that we just spoke with says to my husband in a sarcastic voice," Room # 1234 wants to speak with a manager right away, their heat is in and they just can't stand it any more...blah, blah, blah", This is when my husband speaks up and says, Sir, this is room # 1234 and the guy just stops and says...oh, i must have hit redial, needless to say, my husband just hung up. So now the staff is being sarcastic and rude. So we wait for a call back and a half and hour later we have a knock at our door. Its two repair women, who tell us that the manager sent them instead, and that they were never sent to our room that day to repair it again. One tells us that she did what she could with ours last night, but that they couldn't get new one's until today. Now it 9:00, nobody came to fix or replace it while we were gone all day, and so we wait with them. After they make a phone call to the Head Repair man (on a radio) they ask him to come up, he says he is busy, she tells him it is an emergency and he tell her that she can do it....just check the such and such part. One leaves to get the new part and one stays with us. She returns and goes to replace the part...then a Pipe Burst and boiling hot water is shooting out all over the floor...and hitting the walls across the room....she is soaked and because the water is so hot they are scrambling to find towels or blankets to cover themselves, so they can shut it off and not get burned! It was beyond a nightmare! They now have to move us to another room. I packed everything up and we moved....our room was not on the same Savannah that we had in the beginning, but at this point, we don't care...we put our suits on and now its after 10:00pm and we go to the jacuzzi. I guess the part that really surprised me, is that we never got a phone call back from the manager. After the mess that just happened, I would have expected a manager to call us and apologize, and just check in on us at this point. But we got nothing, not a phone call, not a message on our room phone, not a note! We checked out the later on the next day. Things happen that are out of our control, but I am a business owner and can never imagine not approaching a customer to apologize for something like this. My husband and I get away once a year for a long weekend, as small business owners we work 6 days a week and so look forward to our little getaway, needless to say I would never recommend this property. I have stayed at other Disney deluxe Resorts and can tell you that the service at this Resort is unexceptable. Also, be aware that there are no mini-bars in the rooms, Room service food seems like it comes from the cafeteria restaurant, there is NO poolside service, and you cannot order food from the pool bar. The service level at this Hotel is very poor. As far as the animals go, they are hard to find and are far and few. Customer Service by far needs huge improvement, they just are not living up to what they sell you. I was also told that my package include a private safari for Hotel guest only, yet when we got there upon check-in were told we were not qualified, that this was for special guest at conceriege level only. I actually had another guest checking in directly beside me and overheard her telling her service check-in person the same thing...so when you are told that your package includes a special Safari...get it in writing. Hope this helps in making your vacation a better experience then ours.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Its good to go there for drinks if you don't want to get drunk because you'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad.If I could rate this hotel's service a 0, I would. Recently myself and my youth group attended a church competition in Orlando, Fl. We are from Tampa and traveled to Orlando to stay for a couple of days. Our Pastor booked this hotel for an excellent rate of $99 a room, per night. We had two, two-bedroom villas, for two nights. The total came to a little over $400. It was a great price. After staying there, I now understand why it was so cheap. The rooms were nice, spacious and fairly comfortable. Some of the beds weren't fantastic, but it wasn't unbearable. The first thing I noticed was that the guy who was working the front desk could not have been more than 22 years old. So I figured it was just a family type business and brushed it aside because he was very friendly. Later on in the first night, we realized we didn't have enough towels for all the kids. We had 10 girls in our room, which with the sleep sofas, fit pretty comfortably. So I called down to the front desk to ask for more towels, and they told me that because we had not chosen to have housekeeping for the reservation they would have to charge us for the towels. Upon asking for the price of the towels, I was told it would be 23 dollars a day. Now, our reservation confirmation listed that 10 people would be in one room. So obviously the hotel staff knew this information as well. But we were only given 6 towels. Needless to say, they were literally charging us to bathe. Obviously I declined the towel service, we just decided to recycle the towels we had. Later we ran out of toilet paper. We were originally given one roll of toilet paper per bathroom (2 bathrooms total). So we had two rolls of toilet paper for 10 girls/women to use over the course of 2 days. When we called to say we had run out of toilet paper, they charged us per roll. WHO CHARGES FOR TOILET PAPER? So by this point, we had been charged to take showers and go to the bathroom. You think that if the resort knew how many people were staying in a room withOUT the housekeeping option, they would stock it fairly well. But apparently not. The same first night, we realized we had not blankets or pillows for the sleeper sofas. It took an hour for the pillows to arrive, even though the front desk was a two-minute walk from our room. So when we requested for sheets (surprisingly they did not charge us for these) it took well over an hour, so I called again. The lady at the front desk rudely informed me that housekeeping left at 7, and it was our responsibility to call before then. Like we were supposed to know what time housekeeping went home? So I said that we need the blankets to sleep (this was well after midnight, and we had a performance early the next morning). I, and my girls, just wanted some sleep. So after waiting another hour, a knock finally arrives at the door, and it's the security guard. He brought us pillow cases. Not sheets. So we told him we didn't need those and that we asked for sheets. Needless to say I called the front desk again and the lady huffed and puffed about how the night shift literally consisted of herself and the security guard. TWO PEOPLE RUNNING AN ENTIRE RESORT. How unsafe is that? The security guard couldn't even do his actual job because he was doing housekeeping's. By about 1am we finally got our sheets and were able to go to bed. The next day I went to the front desk and asked to speak with the housekeeping manager. She once again tried to charge me for towels, at which point I said "Okay, you didn't even give us enough towels for how many people are in the room, we're not going to let you charge us to take showers". She finally said she would have the towels sent down. 4 HOURS LATER they had not arrived. So I called again, and when she finally brought them, she was once again very rude and was rolling her eyes at me. Now, I am a Hospitality major in college. I plan to work at a hotel one day. I know what is worthy of a complaint and what is not, considering my future career. But this was just ridiculous. I don't like complaining about service, I feel bad. But I did not feel bad at all at this "resort" because of how rude the staff was. It seemed like bringing us towels to bathe, toilet paper to use the bathroom, and sheets to sleep on, was such an inconvenience. THESE THINGS ARE NECESSITIES. Now, if they had told us at the beginning that we should bring our own towels and blankets because we didn't have housekeeping, we could have been more prepared and been able to avoid some of these problems. But they didn't even tell us that. It was horrible. The last day, housekeeping walks into the boys room at 7am because it was our checkout day. The decided that even though 11am was checkout time, it was okay to go into the rooms 4 hours earlier to see if we had left yet. Now, I think common sense would tell someone that if checkout is at 11am, housekeeping should not even enter the room until at least 11:15am. When we finally were leaving the room at 10:45, the maids were literally waiting outside our door to finish up. I have NEVER experienced anything like that. I travel quite frequently, and to various hotels, but I have never once seen a maid standing at the door waiting for you to leave, and again, before checkout time. It was clear that they wanted us to hurry up and get out so she could start cleaning our room. It was visibly an inconvenience for her. She clearly hated her job. After we left, two of the boys realized they left their bathing suits in the dryer. When we called to see if housekeeping found them, the hotel informed us that they had THROWN THEM AWAY. HOUSEKEEPING SHOULD NEVER THROW BELONGINGS AWAY. Especially a mere few hours after checkout! Any items found should immediately go to lost and found, and then MAYBE after a couple months, be disposed of. To say I was pissed, would be an understatement. I will never stay at this "resort" again. I wouldn't even call it a resort. I'd just call it a terrible experience. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, not even someone I hated. The service was beyond awful, and those people don't even deserve to have that job. I think that resort should be shut down immediately, and turned into something that actually produces an enjoyable experience.I cannot say enough bad things about this hotel. We stayed at the Hotel du Champ de Mars in mid-June of 2009. The trip was for personal leisure with my boyfriend, my cousin, and her husband. I should have taken it as a sign not to stay at this hotel when, previous to our stay, I made many attempts to contact the staff via email on their own website, and never received any response. During our June 2009 trip we stayed our first 3 nights in Paris, spent 3 nights in Rome, and then one last night in Paris. The first 3 nights in Paris we stayed in 2 different hotels and both were miles above Hotel du Champ de Mars in every stretch of the imagination. I am very grateful that Hotel du Champ de Mars was booked for the beginning stretch of our trip because our 1-day stay at this hotel was more than enough. Horrible! There are 3 reasons that I chose to book this hotel in the first place. (1) It was in close proximity to the Eiffel Tower, (2) it was highly recommended by Rick Steves, and (3) the photos on the website appeared very cute for the low price. After staying here, I wonder why this hotel comes recommended at all. The rooms are decent, but beware that the single rooms don’t leave you any extra walking-around room. The price is okay for the area (close to the Eiffel Tower), but to avoid their rude staff, I personally would pay an extra 10 euros to stay somewhere else. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted (this is much too friendly of a word for his demeanor) by an attendant at the reception desk. After giving our name, he just blankly stared at us. I think he was counting our number of guests (only 4 of us) and was confused because they had us booked in one double room and one single room. Mind you, we confirmed the reservation no more than a week prior and had booked 2 double rooms for 4 people. Needless to say, the hotel was completely booked so we were stuck with the incorrect booking…yet charged the same price as if we had 2 double rooms as originally booked. We tried to haggle with this since it was not our fault they overbooked their hotel, but the desk attendant kept stating as long as 2 people were staying in the single room, we’d have to pay double-room price. Oh, and he added, if we didn’t like it, we could leave (and that is pretty much a direct quote). Yeah, at 6pm on our last night in Paris, find a new hotel and still be charged cancellation at this one…I think not. We were stuck with this hotel at this point. Our room (the one my boyfriend and I had) was on the ground floor. It was a decent size and pretty cute. I will attach some photos. The cleanliness left something to be desired though. Wrappers (of who knows what) left on the floor, and many many hairs (ick!) on the bathroom floor and shower. I have photos of this too. It seems like they may have come in and made the bed, but did nothing else. It makes me wonder if they even changed the sheets. Luckily there was a window in the room (that looked directly into the window of the room across the way) and a fan in the cabinet, because this hotel did not have air conditioning. My cousin and her husband’s room, if I remember correctly, was on the 5th floor. There is a tiny elevator (which is common for Parisian hotels to only have a small one if there is one at all), but 5 flights of a narrow circular staircase is a long hard walk even if you are not carrying a suitcase. Since their room was incorrectly booked as a single instead of a double, their bed was a full size bed and the room was only about a foot wider on each side of the bed. Very tiny. The bathroom was also very tiny. I don’t think they would have minded the tiny size of the room as much if they would have at least had a bed that fit the 2 of them comfortably. When we left the hotel later that evening, we were stopped halfway out the door by the desk attendant stating that we would have to leave our key at the front desk. It took us by surprise (since this was never mentioned when we arrived at the hotel) and I have to say we didn’t feel 100% comfortable leaving all our belongings in our room with him having the key to enter…especially with the rude way we had been treated upon our check-in. I guess that is why we had bought luggage locks before the trip. Later that evening we left the hotel again to do some sight-seeing and the desk attendant was not even at the desk for us to drop off the key. We had to wait in the lobby while a 3 other couples also piled up in the lobby to wait. Eventually the desk attendant sauntered out of the bathroom to collect the keys, but only after I had the chance to read a magazine. Overall, our stay at Hotel du Champ de Mars was unpleasant. The rooms were decent in décor, but they were not clean and the desk staff was beyond unpleasant and rude. I can’t imagine they would have been of much help if we would have needed help with anything or needed tourist information. And the desk attendant upon leaving in the morning was equally as rude as the one the night prior. This one ignored us and stared at the computer in front of us and did not look up until he was greeted first. And then his only greeting was to correct our French. This hotel gives French staff a bad reputation and was our only unpleasant encounter of our 8 day trip. My opinion is that they think they can get away with treating people in this manner because being in a foreign country you do not have much recourse against them, and they have a steady stream of tourists and no need for you to be a repeat visitor. In hindsight, I would stay at Hotel de la Paix (the hotel we stayed at our 2nd and 3rd nights in Paris, only a few blocks away and closer to the Eiffel Tower, and the staff and rooms there were excellent) instead or try something in the Notre Dame area. Never again would I stay at Hotel du Champs de Mars and I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone.Stay away from this hotel and its aggressive and violent owner!!! Please read through and decide for yourself. This is long but details are important. We arrived at Abbey Court Westpoint Hotel with our 2 year old and 14 year old sons, on Monday 17th of April right after the Easter weekend. We paid two days in advance (that is half of our stay) because that was the hotel's policy. We had a very horrible experience that made us understand why. At first we were pleasantly surprised, the location is great, the apartment was well equipped, clean, the cot for the little one was ready. The bathroom was very hot and we understood that it was because the water in the toilet was boiling hot as funny as it may sound. We reported the problem and were told that it would be taken care of. At around 6:30pm that evening the toilet flush sink cracked and boiling water started to pour down in the bathroom!!! The reception clerk (who was genuinely very nice I must add) came right away and could hardly touch the main tap leading to the sink in order to stop the water because it was so hot. A few minutes later he came back with the owner of the hotel who did not bother to apologize or even say hello for that matter. Because of the late hour and no other apartment available, we were given the key to another room at the end of the hallway to use the bathroom and were told that the problem would be solved first thing in the morning. Not ideal but we understood the situation... Next morning starting from 8:30 until we left a little before 10am, I had to have at least three phone conversations with the new shift at the reception desk re-explaining the problem and asking that the room be usable by 1pm when I would be back with our little one. The best commitment I could get was a very impatient "OK MADAM! I will leave a note to Room Service!!!" Please keep on reading, this is a horror story!!! When I came back with the little one a little before 1:30 pm, and asked for the key to the room, the people at the reception desk could not find it so they told me that the worker was probably still there. I was quite upset because my son had a fever and I wanted to put him to bed as soon as possible. I went to the apartment anyway but the door was locked and the tools of the worker were outside, and he himself nowhere to be found! I went back to the reception and asked again for the key. I understood that they did not want me in there before the work was done. I had to endure 30 minutes of going back and forth and on-going negotiation to get my key. I asked to speak to the manager, he was "on holiday", I asked to speak to some kind of a person in charge, and that was the lady who had told me coldly that they were doing the best they could when I first asked for the key, and she had gone to lunch leaving me in the lobby with my sonâ€¦ At that point I simply demanded to go into my room and was very generously offered to put my son to bed in another room which I refused because that meant that I still had to go into my room pack some clothes, diapers and transfer his cot. No need to say that I was very upset by then and outraged by the service I received, or the lack of it. I said that I would not pay for that day, that they could call the police if they wanted to but I would not pay! Finally the very-frustrated-reception-clerk agreed to open the door for me, after raising her voice at me and slamming at my face the door of the office leading to the reception desk where she went in order to get the master key. In the meantime the workers appeared at the door and they continued their work while I attended to my son in the living room. This is where the real horror begins... Suddenly, while I was taking my son's temperature with his diapers down, somebody simply barged into the room without even knocking. I recognized the owner of the hotel who I naively thought had come to apologize. He started to shout at me standing very close to me physically and wagging his finger at me, told me if I did not intend to pay I should pick up my things and leave right away. The tone of his voice and his body language were so aggressive that I got really afraid for my son and myself. I asked him to lower his tone, but his answer was that this was his place and he could do whatever he wanted and that the police could not help me. I told him that I did not want to have this discussion in front of the child that we would speak when my husband returned, but he would listen to none of that. He kept telling me that HE would call the police and if I did not leave they would throw all my things out, that they had been very nice to us and that nobody could speak to his staff "that way". At some point he even ordered the workers to leave the job undone and leave. Trying very hard to stay calm I told him that in the name of Go.d I had not spoken badly to anyone, and that is where things got really ugly. Our address reads Israel, he said "You are using my electricity, you slept here you used my money, what kind of God is this God of yours!!! You pay me right now for the rest of your stay or get out of hereâ€¦" waving his hand as if he were flicking away a piece of dirt. At some point during all this yelling and shouting (by the owner of the hotel only, because I had to stay calm for the wellbeing of my son), the lady who had gone to lunch (because she is a "human being" unlike myself and my son) came in (without knocking of course) and said that I had indeed not insulted them or called them names or anything but I had been very "harsh." While the two of them started discussing about our fate! I grabbed the opportunity to call my husband. When he arrived the suitcases were already packed and of course we left that horrible place as quickly as we could. On our way out when my husband asked to speak with the owner of the hotel he was not there and there was only the same junior and very fragile reception clerk. Of course nobody talked about any reimbursement that the owner had mentioned under his breath during his attack. I simply could not bear to stay another minute there anyway, or face those people again, so we left having paid full price for that agony. I was assaulted certainly verbally but also physically, my privacy was violated, and I was robbedâ€¦ I will most certainly report this ugly event to the authorities. This is my story, what you make of it is up to you. Thank you for your time.I was booked into this Hotel for 2 nights in July as i was attending a training course for work purposes and the Park Lane Mews Hotel was close by. I believe in going with an open mind despite reading the recent bad comments on TripAdvisor that this Hotel had been getting. Surely it cannot be that bad? Except yes it really is. First impressions of the building outside and inside the reception is very good, it looks very nice. Until you check in. As soon as you walk in, before saying Hello, you say your name they find the booking and demand full payment, when I questioned could I not pay at the end, they said in a loud stern voice NO I had to pay and did I want to stay or not. Great start !! So I hand over my card, and it is my card as I don't get a company one and its debited. I was asked non smoking or smoking opted for non smoking, and allocated a room on the top floor. Room Impression - On 1st impressions looked not too bad until I turned on the light which by the way you have to put the card in the slot for any lights to work, which isn't mentioned anywhere. Carpet was filthy. Wall paper something out of the 70's. It was thundering and lighting and had been pouring with rain all day he window was open and water drops all over the table. I tried to close the window, and part of it fell to pieces, so its now at an angle. More force and I got it shut and put the broken parts to one side (at least it was shut !!) Air Con unit on the wall again looks about 20 years old, had a red light on it but I had instructions as to how to use. Except the red light meant it was out of operation, however I could still turn on even worse as it sounded as though an areoplane was about to come through the wall. Good job it didn't work. I was trying to get the room warm after the freezing cold wet window. Although you would think they would put a sign saying do not use, instead you can try and turn it on and probably blow yourself up or get an electric shock nice one !! View from window, tower scraper of the back of the Hilton Hotel which had about 10 more floors higher and I had all the fumes from the back of the Hilton breathing into my room. Yes its London but I don't expect to have more gas and smoke than a diesel train not to mention the noise of it even with my window shut. Looking further around - Flatscreen Tv, older than my CRT screen at home, like a box fixed to the wall but beneath a boarded up unit with white plyboard that would of housed an old CRT TV about 10 years ago. Bed is as hard as nails although at least I have a double bed, with plenty of pillows. Kettle has fur in it, so needed good clean out. Coffee and Tea was quite good for amounts, no biscuits or mineral water which I would expect from a 4 star hotel. Bathroom small but looked not too bad, clean. Then tried taking a shower no hot water, no pressure in the water so shower hardly came on this happened both times I used the shower. Worst was the sink it took 10 minutes for the water to drain out. Everyone knows that you have to turn a hot tap on and wait for it to become hot, however the sink was overflowing almost before the tap became lukewarm that is how bad it was. Wether this was because I was on the 5th and highest floor I don't know but it was beyond a joke. I ordered breakfast to arrive in my room, and filled out the card and attached to my door handle at 7pm. The card had to be out by 2am at the latest. Breakfast was booked for 7:15am and when it got to 7:25 I started to get worried. I opened the door of my room and found the card still attached to the door handle it hadn't even been collected and my tray from 6pm last night with a light tea on was still outside as well. I called the meal service option and was asked if I would like to order now, no apology nothng as though it was my fault and when I asked how long would I have to wait the answer "I don't know". Great when you got to be at a training course at a set time, thats the whole point of room service to save time !! I tried to order a taxi the night before, and the hotel refused to order one when I tried to book one in the morning as they advised I did, they told me to go to the Hilton as there was a taxi rank. I went to the taxi rank by the Hilton and asked 7 cabs to take me about 1 mile all of them said no, reason, why well I imagine because they are waiting for bigger fares coming out of the Hilton. I walked to another Taxi rank asked another 3 cabs and eventually found someone who would take me. I arrived late at my course. At last it was my time to leave, I checked out and I noticed that nobdy asked if everything was ok, nobody said thank you or stay again, when I went to raise the issues I had they said well other guest haven't complained and more or less made out I was imaging things and they didn't want to know but then they already had my money at Â£244 for 2 nights rip off, plusÂ£14.95 breakfast and Â£3.50 extra for room service. Travel Lodge for me by a mile anyday even Glastonbury in a tent doesn't have such rude manners. Please do not go there I cannot recommend for anyone, its a joke to say its 4 stars and there is no excuse in the world for being rude to customers and not caring when you pay not only London Prices, but 4 star prices for 1-2 star service. Rip off Britain, I hate to imagine what people from other countries must think of British Hotels if they base everything on this hotel.I found this hotel via hotels dot com where it was listed as a 3 star. It was probably ok as a hostel and certainly wasn't even a 1 star tourist class hotel in my view. I actually booked through the hotels own website where the photos looked decent and the description inviting. They also had an unfeasibly good deal on the week I wanted to stay...I should've twigged that this was too good to be true! I booked for 4nts for about Â£30 per night in a single ensuite. Which for a well-located hotel is excellent. However, I didn't get value for money or the service I was expecting from a hotel listed as 3star. A palace it aint and calling it a hotel is stretching it, more like a backpackers hostel. First of all you have to find it. The pictures make it seem that the entrance is facing the lovely square but it isn't. It's on a wide street where it's Princes Sq on one side of the street and Leinster Sq on the other. Confusing and annoying when you've got to trek your luggage in sub-zero wintryness. First impressions weren't great. The reception staff were brusque and made you feel like you were disturbing their telly watching. I was given a card key and hoped that this would lead me to a clean, comfortable, quiet room. Luckily they had a small lift and I was on the 2nd floor. I got out and the carpet was worn out in places and alarm bells in my head sounded. Passing through the narrow - one person at a time - corridor I saw that some room doors had obviously been broken into before. My room had two single beds with large sash window looking out onto the square which was nice. Except the windows were old and dirty. The room was a riot of multicoloured patterns from the carpet, curtains and bedspread. It hurt my eyes to look at it all, so I ripped off the frilly flowery nylon bedcover. To my horror, there was fluff and hairs all over th underside of it. I flung it on top of the wardrobe and there it stayed. The pillows were flat and rubbish and the bedding was cheap and nasty. No duvets just fleecy blankets and sheets. I wasn't looking forward to sleeping on it. There wasn't much heating on and it felt very cold. The bathroom was ok, some mould on the tiles. But you could tell that they try to keep it clean but the fixtures are old and worn out giving further bad impressions. The shower worked ok but there was no bath plug (NB to work the shower just turn the large middle knob on its own). The towels are old and frayed and not as fresh as expected. I thought that the single toiletry - sliver of soap - they provided was too funny. I later went out and bought a bar of baby soap from Boots for 57p so that I could compare them. I expected to have tea/coffee making facilities in my room but nothing was evident. When I asked about this they said that it was available only from the reception lobby. The TV worked ok and there was a pathetic little hairdryer in the dressing table drawer. There was hanging space but not enough hangers or any shelves. My door had a huge gap at the bottom where the whole floor was on a slant. I had to open my bathroom door across it to obscure it. Don't expect to get much good sleep or any possibility of a restful lie in. Get earplugs. The floors and doors creak and you can hear the person next door or above you snoring, walking, flushing toilet. You don't have the option of not being disturbed in the morning because the eastern european maids must be paid by the number of rooms they clean and they're very persistent. They'll knock loudly from about 8am and keep on. They probably think that everyone likes to get up early and have breakfast on holiday! I don't eat breakfast so I can't comment on what that was like - I can only guess. I suppose the maids being persistent is a good thing as the rooms are cleaned as well as possible and at least I didn't get bitten by any bugs (first thing I did was look for signs of buglife!) Overall, the hostel is shabby and staff are abrupt and verging on the rude. The beds, bedding and towels all need complete change. If it's not hotel whites it must be hiding something? I left a day early and went home. I couldn't stand it anymore. I'd spent the whole day out touring lovely London and meeting friends in the evening but hated knowing that I wasn't going to get a comfortable and restful sleep in that place. The ONLY good thing about the hostel is the location. Being so close to Bayswater and Queensway tube, restaurants, shopping and several good bus routes. Walking distance of Kens' High St and Portobello. If this is your only criteria then good luck but I would strongly advise you to budget more. The extra Â£20 a night or whatever on top would make sure that you do stay somewhere nicer, cleaner and restful for your trip to London.Double check your room reservations before leaving! Let me first say that I didn't expect a 4 or 5 star resort and am very easygoing when on vacation. I'm not a chronic complainer and don't need much to keep me happy. We stayed at the Grand Paradise Bavaro from June 15-22, there were 17 in our group, ranging in ages from 7-60. After reading all the reviews about this resort I made sure our travel agent requested our group be placed in Building 6--on the beach at the main resort. Our tour operator was GoGo. The one thing we were adamant about is that we didn't want to be placed in The Club--we didn't want to have to take the tram to the main area everyday with 9 kids.When we arrived after the hotel (after a very long wait for our transfer) we were told to take the tram to the other side of the hotel. We tried to argue with the desk operators telling them we requested the main hotel area. We were informed that our reservations were at the Club. However, for $50 per person, per night, we could move to the main hotel. When we didn't take them up on their offer then we were told they could reduce it to $25 per person per night. $25 x 17 people. The men at the front desk are con artists. I heard this same story over and over again from other guests. We decided we would check out the Club. Basically, there is nothing at this end of the hotel. If you are there without children and don't care about not having the beach a few steps away--you might enjoy this quieter part of the resort. One pool, one a la carte restaurant and 2 bars, as far as I could tell.After 2 days of arguing with the staff at the front desk, my mother contacted guest services. They moved us all to the main resort immediately. I am a very easy going traveler and I don't sweat the small stuff but I have to say that the first two days of this vacation were complete and utter hell.Rooms: We were in Building 3. Not as good a location as Building 6 but it was close to the pool and the main lobby. The rooms were dark, which we antipated. The bathroom flooded a couple of times and we were without hot water or towels one day--not a very big deal. Rooms were a little run down, fridge not very cold. The AC seemed to work fine. The biggest problem we encountered with the room was the late night noise. The concrete hallway acted like an echo chamber and the other guests were really inconsiderate. Earplugs are a necessity--even for the heavy sleeper. The maids were very kind and accomodating--I left ours a tip and a little gift each day and never had to ask for something twice.Pools: The pools were nice, slightly scummy some days. The biggest problem I had with the pools were that although there were notices prohibiting topless bathing at the pool, dozens of women ignored this. I expected it at the beach but not around and IN the pool. I'm sure my 15 and 17 yo sons didn't care but to me it was just another example of foreign guests ignoring the rules and generally being rude. They smoked in no smoking areas, barged in front of people in line at the restaurants and bars. I found the French very obnoxious (and I hate stereotyping). I also thought the staff could have done more to entertain the kids. The activities revolved around the adults, meringue lessons, water aerobics etc. Our kids were mostly too old for the kids club but I think that when they should make an effort to include the teenagers in some activities.Food: I didn't have a problem with the food. No one in our group got sick. The breakfast got a little boring by the end of the week but there was always fresh fruit and cereal. Lunches were fine. We ate at both the Cana Grill and the buffet. We went to make dinner reservations at the ala carte restaurants and were told they couldn't accomodate a group of 17. We pointed out that they took the $ for a group of 17--then we were given reservations. I wasn't impressed with the ala carte restaurants at all. Italian was mediocre and Cana Grill horrible, orders were incorrect and the wait was awful. The Manglar (French) was very good.I thought the drinks were very watered down and they could use more staff at the bars.Hotel: The hotel buidings and grounds are very attractive. The Sports Bar could use a little updating and better AC, as could the gym. The lobby was beautiful, but on the last day we had torrential rains and the main lobby flooded very badly (imagine 6 men with giant sqeegees). I also agree with the person who said it was everyone out for themselves. There was no orientation (unless you want to sit through a timeshare spiel). You basically had to find out everything for yourself. A good brochure/map would have been a very handy thing.Punta Cana: The beaches are beautiful, as is the turquoise water. We took advantage of the water sports there, kayaking, tubing, banana boats etc. We also took the 2hr. horseback ride and bought gifts and clothing for the local children. That in itself made the trip worthwhile. If you go, don't forget the Dominican children. We went on an ATV trip as well (also lots of fun). The market outside the hotel gates is great but the vendors can be very pushy. If you are looking for braids, walk down the beach to the right. There is a really sweet woman on the beach and she is much cheaper than the hotel salon. Natasha (henna artist) is great at her craft and very interesting to chat with.We had a great family vacation in spite of our problems with the hotel. But I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Don't Do it! We booked the Tornabuoni based on the mostly positive reviews here on Tripadvisor. This site is usually right on the mark, but it failed us this time....forgive the rant that follows, but we had to get this off our chests.We were so disappointed with this hotel right from the start. It was my girlfriend's 40th birthday, and we booked this hotel 4 months in advance through Expedia. We called the hotel a week before our arrival to request an upgraded room since it was a special occasion. They said they would see what they could do..After checking in, they took us up one flight of stairs, then down another (the hotel layout is really confusing) to room 28 - This has to be the worst room in the hotel!!! It was a small, cramped, dark, room with a partial view - of the alley! It felt like a dungeon. To add to it's charm, they were kind enough to leave the dirty imprint of a former occupant's sandal on the wall (apparently someone found a solution to the hotel's massive mosquito problem!) - no 4 star hotel I have ever heard of would ever let that happen, or even provide such on awful room. It really felt like a converted janitor's closet.I was completely embarrassed that I had chosen this place for my girlfriend's 40th, so trying to make it better, we marched back to the front desk and told them there was no way we were staying in this room.We reminded the front desk that we had called and requested a nice room with a view, and the front desk clerk pointed to his hand written ledger and said he didn't see any notes on such a request, and then proceeded to look down his nose at us and said Well, you see, you are Expedia customers, and 90% of our customers book directly through our website...and blah, blah, blah - now I'm even more embarrassed! (Can't wait to write to Expedia about that).But we stuck to our guns and demanded a better room. The guy huffed and puffed and said that the hotel was really full. He said he may be able to give us a different room, but it may only be for one night, then we might have to switch rooms.Not exactly what we wanted to hear, but we figured anything would be better than Room 28, so we decided to go for it, especially since he only said we MIGHT have to move.The second room was much better, can't remember the room number. It was definitely one of the updated rooms that we read about - don't understand why they wouldn't update all of the rooms?We settled in and hoped we wouldn't have to switch rooms again because this room was acceptable.We woke up the next morning, and hadn't heard from anyone at the hotel, so we figured we were OK to stay in this room. We went off to breakfast on the terrace, and stopped by the front desk to leave our room key (This is normal, I guess older hotels don't like replacing their locks when tourists lose their keys).When we returned later that afternoon, we stopped at the desk to pick up our key, which they gave us, and we headed to our room...Shwew! Looked like we were able to keep our room! We get there, and open the door...I didn't recognize any of the luggage in the room? Uh-oh - I guess they moved us??? Good thing we're not criminals, or a couple of tourists would have been out of their belongings...anyway, off to the front desk again...The guy tells us, yes you were moved....Now I really want to lose it - we felt so violated, they had every opportunity to make us aware of that - at breakfast (they ask for your room number), when we left our key at the desk, and when we returned and they gave us the key to that room! Then of course they could've called us too!!!!!!!!We are LIVID! And to make matters worse, they put us back in Room 28!!!!! Why wouldn't they give that room to the people that had just checked in??? We asked and got no answer...and to top it off, they forgot some of our items in the other room!!!!What an embarrassment, I feel like a complete moron for ruining my girlfriends 40th birthday by booking this place.We both want nothing else but to leave this dump, but what can you do - we already paid for it. So, back to front desk we go...we tell them how incredibly disappointed we are. And they don't even offer an apology - we tell them there's no way we're staying in room 28, and they offer us yet another room...but tell us we will probably have to switch again the next day!!! I've had enough, but I left it up to my girlfriend to decide - Room 28 is so bad that she decided we should go for it.So off we go to our 3rd room - long story short, we had to move, yet again, they next day - at least this time they called us in the morning to let us know that they would take care of it while we were out on the town. We moved a total of 5 times...5 TIMES! while we were there.OK, so you get the point - sorry, but we had to get all of that out - we certainly did not get treated very well by this hotel and wanted to warn potential victims who might not want to be treated this way...We would definitely not recommend this place to anyone...but to be fair, here are our thoughts on the rest of our experience:Location:Excellent, and really the only positive thing we took out of this part of our trip - 5 minute cab ride to train station, close to all the sitesDecor  Common Areas:Really outdated throughout - a few nice areas were the reading room (only place to get internet) and the terrace. There were several areas where old pipes and equipment were stored in corners, and didn't look like they had been moved for months - a lot of the common areas were not clean, and they definitely could use a fresh coat of paint throughout. There is no logical pattern to the layout of the rooms - they are scattered in far off nooks and crannies, and can be hard to find, and it is hard to maneuver luggage and large bags.Food:Breakfast was adequate, croissants, fresh cheeses and ham, rolls, good coffee - we had read about a restaurant - but there wasn't one? You could eat your breakfast on the terrace which was nice.Rooms:Hit or miss - we got to experience 4 of them during our 4 night stay!!!! Some are updated, some not...some are REALLY small, others acceptable. All in all, you can do better for the money.To sum it up, even if we weren't forced to bounce around from room to room, we would not recommend this hotel. It is not worth the extra cash you will spend. There are many hotels in great locations nearby that are less expensive, and will hopefully treat you better. And definitely don't book this place through Expedia!Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert, it was overpriced and fell short on taste.Have to tell you: Not at all impressed.Myself and my partner (we are two men) arrived at 2.30pm on Saturday where we were told that only a twin room was available and for that we would need to pay £15 extra per night. We said that we were happy with a double bed which we had booked and a call was then made by the receptionist and we were told that we had to stay ‘down the road’. We asked if the room was the same standard and that it was all Ok and we were advised that ‘yes it was a very good room and we had to stay there because the Corbigoe was full’ (despite being offered a twin room and a vacancy sign showing on the door). We were taken to The Park Hotel on 64 Belgrave Road and were taken to a room 4 floors up (very steep stairs) – Room 14. This room was a very small room with a standard double bed. The room did not have any wardrobe or hooks – so in fact no-where to hang clothes, no cupboards, drawers or shelves so no-where to place anything. The bed was made up with a single sheet on the double bed so only half the bed was covered and the mattress was exposed. A thin blanket and a sheet lay on the bed. There was one towel, one mug (unwashed), one spoon, coffee, tea and no sugar in the room. We were unable to unpack or hang our clothes so spent the night getting ready stepping over our cases. The kettle would not fit under the tap so we could only fill it by scooping water from the dirty mug. The kettle then could only be plugged in on a plug half way up the wall and the kettle had to be held whilst being boiled. We went to Reception and asked to change room and was advised that nothing was available. We asked for the bed to be remade with a double sheet as we did not wish to lay on an exposed mattress, we were told there was nothing wrong with the bed and the sheets were changed only once per stay – after a lot of arguing we finally got a sheet and made the bed ourselves. We asked for an extra towel and again was told we could not have one, the towels were only given out once per stay, we tried explaining it was not reasonable to expect us both to use the same towel and after much arguing finally we got an extra towel, the same went for the mug. The receptionist was extremely rude and unhelpful and made it very hard for us to get these extra items, we asked to speak to a manager but was advised one would not be available until Monday am. When we returned to the room a few minutes later the receptionist burst into the room without knocking and said; ‘sorry sirs you are right the room is terrible, I will get you a refund, the fu~~ing cleaner did not do his job properly, tomorrow I will F~~k him F~~k him..... we were completely shocked by this outburst. The receptionist continually apologised agreeing the room was disgusting and said that tomorrow (Sunday) he would get us a better room and a refund for Saturday, he had also brought with him an open plate of sugar which contained dirty bits. We had an unpleasant nights sleep in what was a dirty cold room and showered in a disgusting mouldy shower. We could only sit on the toilet sideways as our legs would not fit in front of us. That night we returned to the hotel at separate times. My partner came in and went to bed taking the key from reception (we had to leave the key at the desk when going out). I returned at 4am and after knocking continually at the Reception window the receptionist got out his bed which was made on the reception floor and advised me I could not have a key to get in but I must wake up my partner to get in my room– which I therefore did. The following morning we chose not to have breakfast at the hotel as we did not feel satisfied that the food hygiene would be up to standards as the room certainly as not. We spoke to the same receptionist in the morning and again he apologised and said we must speak with the manager on Monday morning (Mr S...?) and he would arrange a refund for us. In the meantime he had said that he had arranged for us to return to our original hotel to a larger room with a wardrobe so we could hang our clothes – all was to be in order and waiting for us. We walked back to the Corbigoe with our luggage and was told by the receptionist that we had to pay £15 extra for the room! By this time I was really annoyed and made it clear i would not be paying anymore. We were then taken to a room on the 3rd floor – room 13. This room was larger with a wardrobe and contained 3-beds. The room was still dirty and the beds made with just a single sheet on the mattress, it was again a disgusting room , however we could hang our clothes. The beds that night were extremely uncomfortable and the towel rail fell off the wall, the Tv only had 4 working channels. During our stay I noted that every fire door was propped open and I advised the receptionist that this was not correct as the fire doors should remain closed to prevent the spread of fire, the receptionist would not accept this and said they were left open to let people in/out. This therefore gave us grave concern as we were up on the 4th floor and our only means of escape in the event of a fire was down the one set of stairs where all the doors were constantly propped open! I also noticed that some fire extinguishers required a re-service this month. That night I returned to the hotel before my partner (who had the key on him) and asked the receptionist for a spare key, he told me ‘no’ and that i had to get the key from my partner. Not being happy I insisted he opened the door with a master key to let me in, finally he gave me a key but said I must return it immediately after unlocking my door, I said NO as I did not wish to walk up/down 4 flights of steep stairs, and reluctantly he followed me up to take back the key. Again we chose not to take breakfast at the hotel. I explained to the receptionist that i wished to have a written confirmation of my complaints which he refused to give. He said i must speak with the manager but the manager was away on holiday. I have photos which I can send you showing all the above mentioned faults should you wish. I am an operations Manager for a Warner hotel so I did realise that @£50 per night we would be not be getting large rooms or anything special in London – we just wanted a clean place to sleep, shower and take breakfast;, however we did expect a clean room and bed, towels, blankets and sheets and to stay in the hotel we had booked and not get treated rudely. We did not get what we paid for and in fact one night did not even get to stay in the hotel we booked for. The whole experience ruined our weekend as we felt uncomfortable walking and washing in dirty rooms, stepping over our cases because we could not hang anything. We tried to speak to a manager and was refused 3-times.As I was searching a hotel to stay for a weekend visit back to San Francisco, I came cross to this hotel which is managed by Shell Hospitality and considered as a "resort" in the company's standard. It is an all suite property right off Civic Center, War Memorial Opera House and Symphony Hall in the posh Hayes Valley area. Welcome area and lounge area are decorated in classic tone and completely charming boutique feel from the beginning of the boutique hotel booms in the industry. The first staff I encountered at Front Desk was not uniformed when I arrived at a quarter past 1PM (a bit early for check-in but it was Sunday and the city is running lower occupancy in hotel industry, so I thought I could give it a try). Of course, the room/suite was not ready. I stored my belongings with the hotel and off my errands in the city. I was told that the room would be ready by 3PM. I returned to the hotel around 3:30PM and was given room 35 after 10 minutes wait by the Front Desk to get someone to acknowledge me. I got the key within one minute and off I went to the classic SF apartment cozy elevator. As I got off the elevator, I almost hit the robe (not sure if it is clean or not), hanging by the door that enters to the wing my room located. I carefully walk around it in the Hotelâ€™s narrow hallway. It indeed reminds me a bit like many of the city sponsored apartment buildings around SF, except the price tag for this hotel was way much higher. As I walked past an opened door with housekeeper inside to get to my room, I knew that my room would not be ready (this came from my experience working in Sales & Marketing department in a two major hotel chains in US for 10 years). The bed was not done and the room had a really bad odor. I turned around and went back to the Front Desk. This time, I was noticed right away. I informed the staff that the room given to me was not ready. They radioed the housekeeping department and I was told that the room was ready after they got the confirmation from housekeeping. I told the FD staff that the bed was not made so it could not possibly be clean and ready. One of the FD staff went into the office behind the desk and later I was given another room - Room 55 on 5th floor. This time I did not encounter the dirty linen hanging from the door and did not notice any housekeepers on this floor. I got into the STUDIO and was really shocked. The kitchenette area was efficiently in front of the door. To the right, there was the bed that I would be crashed for the 2 nights. There was no working area or desk. The tiny night stand houses an old lamp, the house phone, standard hotel radio/alarm and a pile of magazines/hotel information directory (I gathered as I did not want to get more shocks with the 3.5 star hotel accommodations). The armoire right in front of the bed has a VCR-TV combo, few drawers and hangers. There was no safe deposit that could be found as most 2-5 star hotels would have across US. The iron and iron board are tugged away next to the armoire and the mirror wall (YES, the mirror wall that can be found in some road-side motels often with a big billboard offering honeymoon suite by the hour!) On the other side of the bed is a classic armed-chair sits between the window (going out to the fire escape) leaving a bit of room for me to walk by. The studio is really tiny comparing to most hotel rooms I have seen in San Francisco (one of the hotel chains I worked was in the city) but this room is to suppose to be a STUDIO and the hotel names itself as a 3.5 star resort. I was truly disappointed but I told myself to make do since I am only staying two nights. I tried to put away my suitcase and all my belongings since there was not much room to walk around in the bedroom area. The armoire canâ€™t be opened all the way and hit the end of the bed when opens to 60 degree so I carefully tugged my bag in the armoire as well as the portable heater it was left in my room. The bathroom was decent size comparing to my sleeping quarter but I would only consider it was efficient not luxurious or nicely decorated. It does appear to be clean and everything seems to all attached, however, the rose color shower curtain stands way out in this all ivory/creamy colored bathroom. I looked again in the hotelâ€™s website and made sure that I was not making any mistakes on my research before booking the hotel. I found there is some rooms in the hotel SMALLER than mine, called Ballet Room for efficiency travelers (I however had hard-time to image any room smaller than mine). For my type of studio, it supposes to have two chairs and a desk or table according to the hotelâ€™s website. I told myself that there is no way, the hotel can even try to put in another chair or a desk/table and still advertises this studio as comfortable for two people. I pulled over a pillow as my desk on the bed and sat on the one and only chair to make it work as working area. The resort/hotel is not deserved 3.5 star as I have seen 2.5 and 3 star hotel in the city that are more spacious, clean and well dÃ¨cored. I donâ€™t know how the hotel pulled together to get the star rating from AAA and passed the standards as required. Shell Hospitality managed a few great resorts so I was really disappointed that this hotel can be part of Shellâ€™s world of elegant resorts and vacation homes. The rate for the studio was low but I know that I can get some other hotels with less star rating but more comfortable setting for travelers. My back was getting stiff just to sit on the chair and work on the laptop for one hour, a business traveler definitely would not be able to use this property for the business trip.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her.

Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever.

It's garbage.In fact, this was not a Nicoise salad and was barely eatable.this is my review of quite frankly the most useless hotel I have ever encountered. please see my letter to them below and pics attached. read from the top down (incl the farcical response) part 1 Dear Sir/Madam I wish to complain about the treatment received and lack of quality with regard to my stay in the Central Park Hotel from the 11th August for 2 nights. Myself and my partner had arrived in London having been up from 3am british time flying from Palma. Having lugged our bags around we eventually got to the hotel around 3-4pm physically and mentally exhausted. We had requested a double room and arrived to find a small twin room which had any space possible taken up by our bags (which the concierge or anyone else didnt offer to help with). We immediately requested a change of room from 417 I believe and were then switched to 517 (I am not 100% certain of the numbers) which was again miniscule. It began to get even better, as we noticed a power box of some sort right directly behind the bed which I would imagine would surely be a safety hazard. There was also a loose skirting board and bits of carpet not laid properly with threads clearly visible and parts of it partially ripped. Having lifted the duvet it was clear the bed was also not clean judging by the amount of hair in it. I congratulate you for having the first bed I have ever seen in need of a shave! The pictures of the above are attached! We immediately rang reception who promised to get housekeeping to contact us, 15 minutes later having not heard a word we decided to go back to reception and complain. At this stage we were very tired, our bags had been lugged around all day to the point where it felt like an extra body part(s). We told reception we were extremely disappointed with this treatment as we were very tired from travelling and had hoped to rest and wash before meeting friends. We had now changed rooms twice which was a waste of time given the 3rd room was again miniscule (700 and something). Once again no discount/major apology was offered and once more we had to lug our bags again as the staff didnt offer to (concierge was watching sky at this point). This experience has made me extremely angry and frustrated and certainly put a huge downer on my trip to London, things didnt improve as the staff then just ignored us for the rest of the trip even when we made the effort to say hello. Manners dont cost much do they? This included the cleaning staff who didnt even acknowledge us and one member of staff seeing me come out of the lift and turning their back! I began reading some more reviews on my phone which were surprisingly good until I discovered that despite having a concierge there was no facilites to look after our bags until it was time for us to make our way to Gatwick on our check out day. This turned out to be true when we enquired. We again complained that it was the least that could be done given our issue with the rooms and the money we paid (€213 not the dearest price, but it is dear when you consider how much we had to save given our bills, only for I had already been charged through Otel.com I would have left the hotel minutes after arriving). Although I was told facilities are not provided to store bags, I fail to see the purpose of a concierge who from what I can see did absolutely nothing other than watch sky and couldnt even speak english! The reception staff in trying to explain muttered and mumbled a half hearted apology which just made me leave in utter frustration (to lug our bags around once more, to Victoria at a cost of £25). This most defintely the cherry on top of an awful experience which more or less ruined my trip to London. This merely describes my anger and utter frustration with the rooms and the service and staff from the hotel, I am utterly disgusted with the treatment received. I would most defintely not recommend this hotel to anyone! That said I would welcome your comments and a response to this, (an offer of a refund wouldnt go amiss) otherwise I would certainly have no problem in posting this or my views to deter any future visit for anyone across the world on the many websites I use to book hotels (and I am not talking just about tripadvisor or facebook). Given my experience of working in the Government for over a decade I would also certainly not hesitate to contact a local representative or Government Minister to highlight the issues I have raised. I await your response. Yours Sincerely PART 2 Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your email. First you have booked a room in the quiet zone which is in the basement and is a room without windows. But we have allocated a nice standard room which was not up to your expectations and as a courtesy we have moved you to an executive room on the 7thfloor for which the rate is 50% higher than the room you have booked. I refer you to our website which clearly shows that we don’t offer luggage storage facilities and concierge service. And I must attract your attention that we are a 3*** hotel, not a 4**** or a 5***** deluxe. On your next visit to Central Park Hotel please contact me personally and I will be there to welcome you and make sure you get a very nice, executive room at no extra cost. Kind Regards, ********************* Front Office Manager Central Park Hotel 49/67 Queensborough Terrace London W2 3SY PART 3 (which has not been responded to) dear xxxx, Thank you for your response. I am confused as how you came to the conclusion that I booked a room in the basement without windows? The rooms were on the 4th and 5th floors and did have windows. You then suggest that I was moved to the 7th floor into an executive room yet it didnt look at all different from either of the other 2 rooms I declined. Your explanation that "we are a 3*** hotel, not a 4**** or a 5***** deluxe. " is true but I can clearly see that from the site and it is almost as if you are saying that as an explanation for things being so poor. I didnt expect a 5 star hotel and a presidential suite but I certainly expect a lot better from a hotel I pay over 100 Euros a night for. The 2 star travelodge I stayed in near Gatwick airport had a room twice the size for £19, whilst its not exactly the centre of London, it was much better value. I also note that you say you dont provide a concierge service yet there is a picture of it on the main site, as they didnt look after the bags/or even offer any assistance to us, I am not sure what the purpose of it was. Whilst your site does not indeed advertise that it stores luggage I would have assumed that this was a basic service provided as it has been in probably every hotel I have ever stayed in. There is also no reference in your email to explain 1. The attitude of staff. 2. The safety hazard of the second room. 3. The appearance of the room with the carpet. 4. The bed being covered in hair! Again, I would welcome your response. signed xxxRecall on Diamond Food.There is a recent recall on Diamond Pet Foods.<br /><br />Recall Information<br /><br />UPDATED: CORRECT PRODUCTION CODE INFORMATION<br /><br />Diamond Pet Foods Expands Voluntary Recall of Dry Pet Food Due to Potential  Salmonella Contamination<br /><br />Batches of the brands manufactured between December 9, 2011 and April 7, 2012 are affected<br /><br />PLEASE VISIT DIAMONDPETRECALL.COM FOR MORE INFORMATION AND UPDATES.<br /><br />Consumer Contact: 866-918-8756<br /> Media Contact: 816-255-1974<br /><br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - May 5, 2012<br /><br />Diamond Pet Foods today announced that it is expanding a voluntary recall to include batches of nine brands of dry pet food formulas manufactured between December 9, 2011 and April 7, 2012 due to potential Salmonella contamination.<br /><br />In April 2012, Diamond Pet Foods initiated three voluntary recalls of Diamond manufactured dry dog food.

It is fthe first thing that comes to the mind when I think about my stay in the Gran MeliÃ¡. I was in this hotel from the 8/21 to the 8/24. The reservation was done with two months of anticipation. It is really hard for me to think that such a beautiful and elegant hotel has been of such deception for me. Next I will summarize and expose my points of view having used this order: Value, Hotel and Facilities, Front Desk/Activities/check in /check out. A little about me, I was born in Puerto Rico. I have been living in Philadelphia, PA for more than 18 years. I studied in LaSalle University. I travel constantly inside and outside the USA. I consider that the value by money of the hotel is absurd due to the reasons that I will expose ahead. The right price by stayed in this hotel should be $70-$95, not more. The hotel does not work as four stars rather work as two stars top. Moreover, 80% of the employees have a lack of courtesy and respect towards the guests. The facilities are gorgeous, elegant and clean with an enormous swimming pool that is opened 24/7. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable you can accommodate up to four adults and you can request to prepare the sofa bed for you if you needed. The rooms are far from Front Desk. The resort has golf carts that run throughout the grounds to transport you to and from your room every 5 minutes. I do not recommend using the roomâ€™s towels they are dirty and stained. Bring your own towels. The rooms are equipped with a ridiculous electronic candy bar right under the TV set. This potentially will ruin you vacation if you brings kids, the prices are extreme. The resort is near the ocean but, you cannot swim in the beach. There are so many rocks and, seaweed on the beach that make it impossible to swim on it. You cannot use the beach volleyball court because the sand is very hard. I assure you that if you fall on it they have to take you to the hospital with big lacerations. The restaurants are expensive and there is no restaurant with a Puerto Rican flavor. There is an absurd parking fee of $16.05 per night. The resort never told me about it until I arrived. This, I consider is a robbery and a disrespect to the guests that not only have to pay this fee but, to make matters worse a 22% of tax or IVU, whatever. Let talk about check in; when I arrived to the resort an employee made me wait 45 minutes for the check in, first she did not find it in the list since I am member of MAS and soon she requested to me to be seated while she resolve the situation. After 45 minutes and feeling that they forgot me I decided to look for another person in Front Desk. I decided to look for another person in Front Desk. I finally found an excellent employee Jose, who helped me. In the Front Desk most of them are rude and slow with the exception of Jose. We decided to stay at the Gran Melia because we wanted to relax and stay away from all the action. I have to say the Gran Melia ruined my wished vacations planned with months of anticipation because they never informed to me about one of the worse event I have never seen "Heineken Fantasy Island" The hotel made me spend an horrible day WHERE Not only they restricted the entrance to the main swimming pool but, in addition, they constantly harassed with stupid questions. The security of this event was very rude, and constantly obstructed the flow and freedom to walk inside the resort. In the event djs and singers were constantly using obscene words. Do not take kids to the resorts if you know the resort will held an event. The swimming pool could not be used because not only was full to the top also were people drinking, smoking and apparently some of them making sexual things the Djs constantly found it funny. The security never acted on the matter; they were worried only for wrist bands. A Lots of drunken people. In that night the only thing that matter to security was to received money for the event and drinks, not to the security of the hotel, nor of the guests. In less than 30 minutes I observed to leave drunk and unconscious with paramedics to more than 2 persons. The check out was long. It took me over two hours to check out. Most of the time they only had 1 representative working and there were a lot of people in line. In conclusion: Thursday and Friday were excellent days of relaxation and enjoys outside the mishaps with Front Desk. Saturday and Sunday were the most horrible of my life. I strongly believe that the hotel must warn everybody in case of any event or celebration where they would limit the use of the facilities. The best thing of the resort is the physical beauty. Unfortunately, I cannot say that I will be returning to this resort.We've stayed at the Grand Hotel Dei Dogi every year bar one (where we stayed at the 5 star Boscolo Aleph in Rome - now that's another sore point!!!!) for the last 6 years and initially we couldn't recommend it more. Our first stay was brilliant - staff were excellent and the whole experience was superb, hence returning year after year. However, nothing ever seems to stay the same nowadays and over the last 6 years the quality of the hotel and especially the service and attitude of staff has waned gradually but this year has plummeted dramatically. I booked this trip in March and as I am a Boscolo Card holder requested at the time of booking, my complimentary free upgrade to the room we stayed in the previous year. I assumed as this was requested 5 months in advance it had been actioned. Nearer the time of travel I sent an email requesting confirmation of this request - no response - then another a few days later - again no response. So, with fingers crossed we travelled. We firstly flew to Rome and stayed in the Regina Baglioni (we normally stay at the Aleph but after dreadful treatment there - is this a trait of the Boscolo group I wonder....). The experience at the Baglioni was fabulous - we have stayed at countless 5 star hotels and this rates up there with the very best. Superb, attentive staff, great room with excellent air con, great service, great location - great everything really. We then flew to Venice to stay at our 'old faithful' Grand Hotel dei Dogi - yes, it had lost it's excellent status over the years, but we were confident it wouldn't slip further - how very wrong we were... We were greeted, AFTER struggling up the step into the hotel by a doorman/porter in bright white Nike trainers! We went to the desk where we were greeted with indifference by the femail receptionist. No warm welcome at all. I asked her if my request for the upgrade had been made to the specified room and she said no, because that room was one grade above the upgrade - so why wasn't I told this 5 months ago or anytime since that booking and the two request for confirmation so I could have done something about it - payed more to secure it? She said the hotel was full anyway so that was that. I was a little annoyed to say the least but kept my composure and accepted we would have to compromise. Not the best of starts. We were shown to our room and it was awful - small, a very low ceiling, windows set at skirting board level and only half way up the wall, ie a nice view of your midriff for those below but no view for you! Obviously we went down to reception and politely requested if it was at all possible to move rooms - the receptionist was ignorant and put out! This got me seiving inside as I had paid Â£750 over 5 months ago (and this was with an early booking, pay in full up front discount!) for three nights room only for this 'service' - a not inconsiderable amount. She just kept tutting and shaking her head and showing she was annoyed with us! I then had just about had enough of this attitude, this lack of respect and service and said we'd be more than happy to leave and I would like a refund. She then said we could have the room originally requested(!) BUT we would need to pay another 200 euros PER NIGHT!!!! Thanks for nothing!!!! I spoke to my wife and said spending another Â£400+ with this hotel was not something I wanted to do so I said no. She then said we could look at another few rooms (I thought they were full?) so, with a heavy heart we agreed. The rooms were in a row - Room one was bad - tiny, dark - no good. Room 2 was only a tiny bit better and a third room was about the same. My wife was getting annoyed so I said room two - bit of a mistake!!! When the porter had gone I went into the bathroom - or should that be shower room!!! Oh dear - my wife likes a bath - me a shower and I assumed all the rooms had a shower over bath set-up but no. I did notice the third room had a bath as the door had been open but hadn't noticed this hadn't as the door had been closed. Yes, my mistake, innocent and understandable I am sure you'd agree. I popped to reception and said appoligetically that we had just realised that the room didn't have a bath and could we move to the third room - well, was she annoyed or what. She huffed and said 'well you didn't ask for a bath, tut,' shake of the head several times!!! There was no, 'No problem sir - certainly you can move to the next room'. A truelly dislikeable, ignorrant, inpolite and rude person as you would ever have the displeasure in meeting. We moved rooms and on closer examination it was shabby, unclean, badly leaking shower screen all over the floors (very dangerous), noisey and ineffective air con, no turndown service (had been every other year), fraying furnishings, dark, noisy - need I go on...) but we were beyond caring - we just got out at every opportunity. On the second night the room beside us was taken and it seemed like a party was going on with at least 4 very raised voices (in a double room - very cosy!) It was like the people were sitting at the foot of our bed! it started a 11.50pm with a huge bang, bang on the nexr door and after much merryment, 2 people left the room at 2am. The 2 people left in the room continued to below at each other until almost 4am! Bad luck I guess... Suffice to say, we will NEVER stay there again. I am sure some people have had reasonable stays there, but take it from me - I've stayed there many times - not like these 'one hit wonders' - 'oh we'll definitely be going back' brigade. It's been sliding for several years but started at such a great height of 5 star luxury and class that it has taken until now to hit rock bottom - and boy has it done that. The Boscolo group need to get their act together as we have had dreadful service the last two times we stayed at the Aleph in Rome to, so this seems to be a serious problem stemming from their choice of employees. Italians are good people but can come across as a little curt - it's just how they are - nothing is meant by it - but the Boscolo staff at the dei Dogi and Aleph take this to a whole new level...I am slicing through my Boscolo Priviledge card as I speak....Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.It was July 1st, 2011 when my cousin called me from the Best Western Hotel located on 1177 Madison Ave. in Memphis, Tennessee. We both had made reservations to stay at the hotel with our family during the 4th of July holiday weekend. I had made reservations for three rooms for a three night stay. My cousin proceeded to tell me that the desk clerk at the Best Western was very unfriendly, the sofas in the lounge were dirty, the hotel smelled like mildew and paint, the hotel was located in an unsafe area and she was hesitant about staying one night in the place. She further stated that the desk clerk refused to cancel our reservations because of their 24 hour cancellation policy. Neither one of us were informed about their policy when we made our reservations. After we finished our conversation, I immediately called Best Westernâ€™s customer service line to plead our case, but again our request was denied. Eventually my cousin decided to call one of our uncles to pick her up until I arrived in town. When I arrived at the hotel my family and I checked in because at that point we had no choice. I still had three rooms reserved on my credit card at $119 per night and I didnâ€™t relish the idea of paying over $600 for rooms we didnâ€™t even stay in. A couple hours later my mom, my brother and my nephews arrived at the hotel and they also refused to stay at the hotel because they were concerned about the location and the cleanest of the hotel. Instead they checked in at the Holiday Inn located on 3700 Central Ave., in Memphis for the same rate I was paying at the Best Western, so my husband and I agreed to join them with our kids the following morning. At the Best Western, the carpet in our room was dirty, one of the walls had stains on them, the wall paper around the window was peeling, the furniture in the room was extremely dusty and my daughter discovered black foot prints in the bathtub, so much for southern hospitality. This hotel was truly a dumpster dive. My cousin and I were both deceived by the pictures of the hotel on the internet. When I woke up the next morning I immediately went downstairs to check on my car while my family slept. To my horror, the front passenger window had been broken out and glass was everywhere. Then I noticed that van that was parked next to my car also had a broken window. This should have never happened because both cars were parked in a well lit area and close to the building. Furthermore, the parking lot was small, both vehicles were parked in the direct view of the security cameras, and a night attendant was on duty. I checked my car to see if anything was taken. A few items were stolen from both vehicles, but nothing that couldnâ€™t be easily replaced (i.e., dvds, tapes,). When I reported the incidents to the night clerk, she claimed she was unaware of what had transpired that night. Someone please tell me what was the purpose of the hotel security cameras? Later on I found out that a third car had been broken into and possibly more vehicles. This particular vehicle was sitting in the parking lot less than 50 ft. away from the front office and once again it was in a well lit area. So, when I asked the night clerk had she notify the other guests concerning their vehicles, the night attendant stated she didnâ€™t know which guests owned the vehicles. Imagine their surprise when they eventually saw their cars. I found it quite odd that the hotel didnâ€™t record the car tag and driverâ€™s license number of their guests when they checked into the hotel. Maybe I am wrong, but I thought this was a standard practice at most hotels and motels around the U.S. today especially during this post 911 era at least it use to be. When I spoke to the manager that morning, she didnâ€™t seem at all surprised about what had happened to my car nor did she seem to care about my familyâ€™s current predicament. In fact, she was very cold and totally removed from the entire situation. However, she did agree to refund me for one of the roomâ€™s on my credit card. So while my husband was cleaning out the glass of our rental car (â€œThank GOD we have GEICO insurance!â€�) I gave the staff at the hotel a â€œHUGE!â€� piece of my mind and I proceeded to tell every guest at the hotel about our â€œWONDERFUL!â€� stay at the Best Western. Fortunately, I was able persuade several customers (10+) from staying at that hotel. At the end, I felt slightly vindicated even though I lost all of my cool points for the day. Later my husband told me that the people who worked in the building behind the hotel informed him that our incident was not uncommon at this hotel. In fact, guests were often robbed at this hotel. Furthermore, the building that was located on the right rear side of the hotel was a crack house. I donâ€™t know how true this latter statement was, but I wouldnâ€™t be surprise. The building did look suspicious. On another note, the company that I had rented our car from was Budget Car Rental. When I called the company to report the incident they were very friendly and understanding. We were able to trade the Nissan Sentra in for a Jeep Compass without any additional charges. The SUV had excellent gas mileage for a vehicle of its size. So after our ordeal we checked in at the Holiday Inn where the rest of my family was staying. The rooms were extremely clean, the hotel was in a safe area and the staff was very helpful and friendly. Best Western should really take a lesson from Holiday Inn. Later that evening, I called customer service at Best Westernâ€™s headquarters to report the entire incident. They finally removed all of the charges off my credit card, but not from my cousinâ€™s credit card. This really didnâ€™t make any sense to me because everyone that I told our story to at the hotel canceled their reservations and the charges were immediately removed from their credit cards even without a 24 hour notice, this is definitely double standards. Customer service at Best Western further stated that the hotel in Memphis would be given 7 days to correct all of complaints that we filed against them. Will they improve the quality of services they provide their customers at this location? Who knows, but one thing I do know for sure is that my family will never, ever, ever stay in the Best Western on Madison Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee again. â€œHats off to Holiday Inn!â€�This is the first time I have put anything on the trip advisor .we booked to stay in the Riviera hotel in Las Vegas from the 14/9/2011-29/9/2011,we have stopped in this hotel for the last few years, going twice a year for a total of 30 days in total each year. We booked with Expedia and paid extra for the encore room (Monte Carlo tower) where we always stay, had read some bad reviews since it was taken over this year but thought some people just like to moan and have always enjoyed the hotel every time we stayed there. On arrival we had to wait 45 minutes in line to book in a lot of people were complaining about their rooms. When it was our turn we gave the receptionist our booking and she said fine and then said that will be $111 for resort fees we said we always pay that when we leave to which she replied it is now paid when you book in, so we paid it, she then said you can’t have the encore room and we said we paid for an encore room and that’s what we want, she said no one is staying in that tower as work is being done to upgrade that tower, we were not happy and she said that we were to be upgraded to a better room we said no thanks we just want what we paid for, she said at least look at the room, so we went to see it .it was in the Monaco tower and the room was a lot smaller with the old type of noisy air conditioning unit it also had a connecting door, but more to the point these rooms cost less than the encore, so we went back down and said we don’t want the room, she said that’s all we have take it or leave it. I just looked at her and said get me the reception manager and was told that she was on her break for the next hour, by this time I had had enough so I said are you sure that no one is staying in the Monte Carlo tower and she said yes, so I replied well the workmen must be staying in the rooms then as we saw lights on and people in the rooms when we passed, so I will just go up and check to see who comes out of the rooms and ask them if they are guests shall I, she then said that what she meant was that no more rooms were being let out in that tower so that work could start in that tower, I said we booked with you 6 months ago so why were we not told this, she replied not our problem and anyway it’s a first come first served basis and as you didn’t book with us direct it’s not our problem, speak to your tour operator it’s their problem, I just said what’s the name of your manager she said Annette, I said tell Annette we will be back to see her. We went back and had to stand in line again while 4 people in front of us were complaining to Annette, when we got to speak to her she was very offhand with us and I said we are not stopping in that room and I do not like being lied to and told her what had gone on previously she just looked at us and I said well, my wife said so we are at a stalemate and I said we have been travelling for 18 hours so get me the c.e.o. of the casino, she said that he was only in charge of the casino and I said well he is in overall charge of the whole casino of which this is a part, she then said that we would have to wait until the next morning to speak to him, and I said well we do now have a problem as we will not stop in that room and we have stopped in this hotel on numerous occasions and if you check your records it will prove that we always stay in an encore room, she went away and was some time when she came back it was with a totally different attitude, she then gave us a key to a room in the south tower room 763 the room was bigger but had a connecting door and the air conditioning was making a lot of noise, so we went back and said no, she then gave us the key to room 761 same room but next door it looked better than the last room, by this time we could hardly keep our eyes open, so we took that room, on checking the bed found it had only 2 sheets on it, no cover, blanket or duvet, so we rang housekeeping and had one sent up. I wish that we could say that was the end of it but no. Next morning after a sleep we checked out the room and it was terrible very badly run down and furniture covers all ripped, air condition unit filters had not been cleaned for years so the unit not working right. There was water on the floor at the bath (later found out that the toilet was leaking) when we complained about it you would think that all you had to say was that it was leaking please fix it, no I had to explain in detail where it was leaking from, I felt like saying just send me up the tools and I will fix it myself .the fridge was coated in filth and set to highest output controls ripped out so totally iced up. We stuck it out for 2 days but had had enough, so we booked into other hotels downtown (main street station, Freemont, Fitzgerald’s and the Las Vegas club, all of these hotels were far superior in every way polite and helpful staff, nice rooms and far cheaper than the Riviera. Also there were no resort fees and the safe was included. In total we spent 5 days out of 15 in the Riviera and out of them we ended up with a Mexican couple with a child in the next room to us from the 23/9/2011-26/9/2011,we had to suffer screaming and shouting up to 4am for 3 days and to add insult to injury in the morning they had a do not disturb notice on the door. The maid service was just about none existent a quick flick around, we had the same sheets on the bed for 10 days I know this because the top sheet had a rip in it and 3 holes on my side. The hoover was run over the room 3 times during our stay we checked the room most days. I could go on and on but to finish I will say we were booked to go back again in November for 16 days at the Riviera but we phoned up and got the travel agent to change our bookings to another hotel thank god, as for complaining to the management why keep complaining my advice to anyone considering staying at the Riviera don’t go elsewhere where you are treated with respect and politeness, even when we booked out all that was said was that’s you all paid up .no hope you enjoyed your stay and look forward to seeing you again. So go elsewhere don’t put up with rubbish treatment and bad service it’s your money and your holidayWe spent seven nights at the Mayan Palace in Riviera Maya. From the moment we started checking in we should have known how awful the resort would be. First, I should say that this week was a wedding gift from my inlaws...it was our official honeymoon. So, we did not have to pay for the room but I know what it cost them (they are timeshare owners) and if I had paid for it I would be really mad. Checkin: We arrived before checkin time which is not until 3 pm, the clerk said they had a room for us.....which was probably the room furthest from anything. (Note that there are NO rooms close to the pool area/restaurants,etc). So, I asked for a diff room, he said there were none yet, but when we said we would wait...magically more rooms poped up. He said he would put us in building four and then said "oh wait, that room is still being cleaned but there is another room in the same building." After signing for a safe and authorizing delivery of a newspaper to our room each day (which I later found out they don't do anymore anyway, if you want a paper you have to walk to the conceirge desk to get one). Then we were escorted to our room...which was not afterall in building 4 but in was in building 7. Even further from everything, as soon as we got to the room we called the same clerk at the desk---he said "oh no there isn't another room available until tomorrow, come here tomorrow and we will move you closer". Well the next day they flat out refused to move us and lied saying there were no more rooms (they were only at 65% occupancy with many people leaving on Sundays so I know there were more rooms). Lesson here: Get the room you want right away, be ready to fight for it. Once you get to a room you are stuck there. The Pool: Yep, there is a big pool, a series of conected pools. They aren't very clean. There are lots of bugs floating around and scum on the tiles. The water is warm. There is construction going on near the pool area..they are building a whole to new complex...so to relax by the pool was not an option as they are banging away, welding, etc. All of the time. And then there are the crazy games in the pool area....a guy on a microphone shouting, maybe 10 people interested in playing the games, and bad loud rap music stopping an starting. There is one happy hour and it is from 11 to noon. Make sure you ask if your order makes it within that time period b/c as we found out one minute late with the waiter submitting your order and then two for one drinks are charged as four drinks. Nice. The pool area futon beds. Some people I guess get up at the crack of dawn to get them. Unless you do this you won't get one. They do not enforce the rule that you can't reserve your beds by placing your stuff there. There is a lack of umbrella shaded areas so people fight over these also. The Food: Depends on what you eat. I can say that as a vegan there were no options. We did eat at the nicer Italian restaurant on site and had overcooked overpriced pasta and a snooty waiter. That was fun. Timeshare: Oddly they never bothered us with timeshare offers. Constant sales people: As you try to relax by the loud pool, you will be interupted every 15 minutes by someone from the resort who wants you buy a ticket to their dinner and show, someone who wants you get your picture taken with a monkey, snake, bird. , some who wants you to spend money on a day trip. Constantly each day the same thing. Pretending to sleep or read doesn't stop these people. By the way nothing is free. The literature that they give you saying you get free snorkel equip,etc well that isn't free..you just get to use it if you purchase a trip. Employees: Walking around slowly, everywhere all the time, once in a while sweeping around the pool area, scooping a bug or two out of the pool. Mostly just loitering around. They really like to sweep around and push their carts right in the area where you sitting, sleeping, reading. We did end up having to make a trip to the medical clinic on site...and they I can say were great. Smart, honest, quick, and willing to share information. Bugs: Yep there are bugs. It is a jungle. Doesn't bother me really, put on bug spray if you don't want to get bitten I guess. But, they spray the whole resort outdoors with a fogger and this stuff is poison. The guy that sprays it wears a ventilated mask...you will wish you had one if they spray around you..which they will if you are waiting for any number of minutes for their shuttle to get you to/from the main gate. The highlight of the resort was a very friendly stray cat that wandered about in the evenings. Outside of the resort: Playa Del Carmen is a quick bus trip. The city is poverty stricken, lots of garbage, stray dogs, is is really sad. The tourist strip has a lot of locals selling all of the same junk...and they harrass you as you walk past to try to get you to look at their store area. There are many resort reps downtown that will hound you as well to try to get you to purchase day trips. Xel Ha is an ecopark. Not very eco-friendly. The snorkeling was just OK...we had much better snorkeling around the Big Island of Hawaii. There were lots of people smoking and throwing their cigarettes around, you can see them on the ocean floor while you snorkel. They sell you their own brand of eco-friendly sunscreen which you must use (17 USD a bottle) and once you get in the water it all just floats right off in an oily cloud. Final Word: Don't waste your time or money here. This is not a highend resort, however, there are some in the area. I would never go back here. At good resorts they should work to make you comfortable, they should not constantly interrupt your time with sales pitches,etc.Consumer advocacy is not the first need that comes to mind when spending a weekend in a Venice blessed by perfect spring weather after deciding that once in a while itâ€™s worth splurging on a luxury hotel. However, the Molino Stucky Hilton, a late 1800s industrial flour mill sitting in a quiet location off the beaten track (the Giudecca island, also home to the historic Cipriani hotel) yet minutes by boat from anywhere in Venice, beautifully renovated as a hotel by the Caltagirone group and opened with great fanfare under Hilton management in 2007, manages to disappoint on so many counts that at some point I started keeping a list. Call me a snob, call me someone who canâ€™t appreciate the fine things in life, but here are seven ways a hotel can go wrong â€“ and at the Molino Stucky Hilton, all seven are wrong. 7. Internet access, provided by Swisscom, is fast and reliable but offered at extortionary prices. Business packages are 24 hours for â‚¬27 or 7 days for â‚¬108; if you choose Economy access (bandwidth and data volume limitations apply), you can choose between 60 non-consecutive minutes within a 24-hour range for â‚¬12 or 24 consecutive hours for â‚¬22. During a three-night stay, I burned through three of the sixty-minute packages â€“ I hardly ever used the full hour, mind you, which only left me the added frustration of not being able to carry any unused minutes over to the next day. 6. There is no turndown service for the night, unless on request. And even on request, there is hardly any turndown service â€“ it mostly consists of the removal of some pillows to a chair or a closet, depending on the housekeeping whim of the day. Drapes were left open for us to remember closing on our own. For rooms that set you back between â‚¬400 and â‚¬700 per night (but you can also choose a â‚¬3,700 Tower Suite, should you be so inclined), I find it in extraordinary bad taste not to provide turndown service by default. 5. Iâ€™m all for the environment, and in principle I do sympathize with the effort to conserve water and not dump synthetic detergents into the Venice Lagoon. Yet, for the aforementioned â‚¬400 to â‚¬700 per night, I expect to have the option to keep the same sheets night after night, should I so desire, by placing a little green card that says â€œIâ€™m green, donâ€™t change my sheetsâ€� on my bed before leaving the room in the morning. I do not expect the default option to be that Iâ€™ll have to sleep in clammy sheets, unless I remember to place on my bed the little green card that says â€œIâ€™m just not that into green, so do bother to change my sheets, pleaseâ€�. That is precisely the unpalatable choice that the Hilton management inflicts on any morally conflicted guests at one of its most hyped luxury locations, and probably elsewhere too, considering how much cheaper it is. 4. Suites and junior suites come with complimentary access to an Executive Lounge on the sixth floor. On inspection, however, this turns out to be a singularly depressing space, dimly lit with minimal amounts of natural light coming from gunholes on top of the walls, and reminiscent most of all of a narrow airport lounge at some minor hub. An inexplicably undrinkable orange juice is served, and Sunday newspapers only appear on Sunday morning only after reminding the lounge staff that Sunday is, indeed, a day of the week when many newspapers are regularly published. 3. A beautiful swimming pool on the seventh floor of the building is surrounded by such precious few deckchairs that, on a sunny afternoon, guests start getting turned away. This may be indeed a structural limitation, yet it is not one that the hotel designers couldnâ€™t foresee. Another rooftop solarium, perhaps? Deckchairs in the garden? Itâ€™s only May and youâ€™re running the pool at full capacity â€“ how many guests are you going to disappoint by July? 2. Ah, no pool, but at least one can get up in the morning and go to the state-of-the-art-gym for a good workout, right? (Remember the open drapes issue above â€“ item 6. â€“ and the fact that the sun does rise at a very early hour these days, especially for a weekend morning). Most people who work out are used to getting their workouts sometime between 6 and 8 am, right? Well, no such luck. The gym, which is described in the in-room Guest Services book as opening at 8 am, really doesnâ€™t open until 9 am. Guests who show up in workout gear anytime before 9 are turned away. 1. Finally, the staff is spectacularly untrained and occasionally clueless. (With a notable exception at the spa, the only department where people were competent, experienced and friendly: if you need a beautician, ask for Ella). Almost everybody looked like theyâ€™d just shown up for their first day of work. A request for Earl Grey tea at the aforementioned Executive Lounge (item 4.) was met with an uncomprehending stare and two consecutive attempts at tea that were not Earl Grey. A pool attendant (5.), asked whether there might be a house phone nearby, gleefully answered â€œI have no clueâ€�. Lapses in training, even at a hotel costing you the aforementioned number of Euros per night, can be forgiven; lapses in attitude will poison the guest experience to the point that a guest will only return under extreme duress. (For a well-thought-out philosophy of the hospitality business, I recommend Setting the Table by New York restaurateur Danny Meyer). Of course the Molino Stucky Hilton is not a boutique hotel. But still, one would wish to enjoy some glimpses of good service, and good management, even when staying at a bigger place. The Park Hyatt in Tokyo, in my experience, had just that kind of magic sauce. The Molino Stucky Hilton doesnâ€™t.Please if considering staying in this hotel, read this review, then take my advice. I am in my 30's and stayed here with my girlfriend for four nights in July 2007. The 'Grand Plaza' provided me with the most disgusting hotel experience I have ever encountered. A stunning lobby and downstairs decor and a superb location.....where could it go wrong?? Firstly move to the bedroom floors and you will find a delapatated, stale smelling, run down, unmodernised and ill maintained set of rooms and corridors. The room i stayed in contained furniture that was falling apart, a toilet floor filled with leaking water, a shower that wouldn't be powerful enough or warm enough to wash a bar of soap and prehistoric air conditioning that did not work. It lacked style, comfort and feeling. The door provided little security and the safe resembled a childs' moneybox. (Please read other readers comments regarding the safe.) Breakfast ceased being served at 10.30. Unusually for myself I decided to make an effort and recover from a slight hangover and go to breakfst about 10.20. Lucky for me!!! Two days running at least 10 stunned guests were turned away for being no more than 5mins late. The entrance door was closed and locked, then manned by the head waiter. Rather than allow guests in, the waiter became involved in various very load and public shouting matches with guests trying to enter. These scenes were unbelievable, with well meaning guests and families being shouted at like prisoners and phsically being blocked from entering. My blood was boiling as the way these matters were dealt with was a disgrace. The guests were turned away, one set of which was literally 2MINS late!! The conduct was ignorant and undignified to the extreme. Further guest humilation was to follow as no food whatsoever was to be removed from the dining area. One by one guests were told to leave fruit, croissants etc behind and were screaned (visually) for innocently carrying out any items. Yet again a great public argument ensued with grown men, women and families being involved with very public and embarassing disputes. This experience was shared by many guests and was more akin to a scene from a prison. I personally filled my pockets with goodies and allowed my girlfriend to shield me from view!!!!!!!!!! The hotel staff have been noted in various reviews as being friendly and efficient. A bank manager smiles until you ask for money!!!! Firstly I had to use the internet service to book a hotel for the following night in Sorrento. It didnt work and the staff having informed me they would help on five occassions within an hour, did not make one attempt to assist me. I returned yet again to the main desk and was finally informed that the service was working and it was, wait for it, my problem I didn't know how to use the internet. The lobbly was quiet, it was 10.30pm. Honestly, you couldn't make it up. Reception couldn't inform me of what was the best way to travel to Sorrento simply replying in perfect English ' I don't know' before staring vacantly at me and holding a silence. This perfectly matched their outlook, ignorant, unhelpful, abnoxious, rude and devoid of all personality. This particularly applied to the stout, tall doorman, and the tall dark skinned man (I forget names now) who worked on the left hand side reception entering the hotel. He has been reffered to as 'the prince' in other reviews and remains one of the most dispicable people I have ever met. On leaving the hotel which was economy wise a complete rip off and a total waste of money, it was time to pay. I was travelling with a new maestro card that I had used to make the booking online with, and had handed over at reception at check in as per usual to prevent non payment. The cards details had been used successfully to book online, and been taken by the hotel. Probelm though, I couldnt remember my PIN. ( not asked for initially at reception) All hell broke out, now it was my turn for a public slanging session with 'the prince'. Couldnt swipe my card, couldnt use previous transactions, couldnt put it through manually, the manager was unavailable, nothing but a blazing row with me was going to suffice. Initially I was well mannered and composed and made great efforts to help. I explained that surely the purpose of taking my card at check in was to prevent future non payment and prevent any future problems. At this stage whilst trying to offer help the prince stopped listening and repeatedly pointed down to me shaking his head, stating over and over 'not my problem, your problem!' Enough was enough. I refused to foot the bill in cash due to the ignorance of this baffoon and when told the police would be called I erupted and encouraged him to do so. I wasnt going to be talked down to like other guests and be made a fool off in front of my gorgeous girlfriend. So after trading a great barage of insults that unprofessionally for him stooped into the gutter, the manager who was said to be initially unavailable was now very contactable by telephone. My passport details were taken and photocopied with both sides of my card. For revenge I complained vigourously on the phone to the manager about the conduct that I was exposed to and wasnt satisfied until I publically humiliated the prince for being incompetant for a good 5mins, before lifting my luggage and leaving. I think he gathered from my body language that I would have been more than partial to a bit of boxing before leaving. Anyway the point of my review is to completely discourage people from staying at this hotel. It is hugely over priced, dilapitated, has disgusting unhelpful staff, and is a huge disappointment all round. Generally I would not complain about much in a hotel and have stayed in the finest luxury to the lowest. I dont rate reviews that are negative for the slightest of issues however numerous but have been left with such a sour taste on this occassion that I felt obliged to. Read other negative reviews and then compare. A horrible experience. Ah well, at least I got some good lovin!!!! The big bonus is that payment still hasnt been taken!!! I think the hotels policy of 'not my problem, your problem' should apply to this case. It would be a shame to upset the prince again. He who laughs last laughs loudest.Dont go Let me start by saying i have never listened to anyones reviews before. my mistake , this place was awfull . we had arrived with our 4 children at 8 on the evening we was told by the travel agents we would have ajouning rooms when we went to reception this was not to be . but still we managed to be in the same block , they could not understand me and therefore couldnt do nothing about it.it rained on the second day and this caused a flood through the roof of the apartment in my room right through where the electrics was. i rang reception and told them that my room was leaking water through the vents and they replied . its raining yes.the evening entertainment was a different show every night wich was good. although we are one jacket and a pair of trainers missing. this happened because when the show finishes instead of telling evryone they are closing they just turn the lights of. no warning no nothing ,so when we tried to find my daughters trainers and jacket in the pitch black it was inpossible. i went to look for them early the next morning but they was gone. so i went to reception and asked if they had been handed in . i was told they hadnt yet but they would be. we never got them back. when i went back to asked they just shrugged it of like it was my fault.the rooms was basic but tidy. we had the rooms made up everyday wich was good.after 2 days of being there they closed the main reception wich in turn closed the lobby bar and the disco so we was left 2 bars short of what we had originally wich was 5.when you went down to breakfast it was like a biulding site you could hear them hitting the walls with sledge hammers and other tools. anyway thats not all the beautiful gardens they say are there was not to be they drained the ponds in the gardens and left the fish to die on the bottom. after 3 days in the sun you can only imagine the smell and this is within 10 ft of the buffet. the flys that then decended on the buffet made it almost inpossibe to eat.i complained to reception with a lot of other people already there doing the same. i told them about the rotting fish so the next day the cleaned it up.none of us should have needed to tell them this it should have been done anyway. we was told that because of the main reception and bar being closed and the disco we could use the sister hotels facilitys, we walked into the oceans sister hotel and was told we could not eat or drink in there because we was not italian and this hotel was just for italians and employees. we went to see the rep about all of this in wich she said she would sort out my flooding . this never happened. she did however go to the manager in the sister hotel and after 6 days we was allowed to eat and drink in there. even this was afetr some negotiating with the buffet staff who had to check with reception if it was okay.the swiming pool had lights fitted round the edge under the water . 3 of these lights had come loose and was just hanging there in the water i know they would have been water proof but it just looked so bad as the pool was a good size and well kept.they only had one bar staff on most of the bars so it was hard to get served especially the beach bar who had one barman on who diidnt open up till 10.30 or though it was supposed to be 10.00 . even then he would just carry on talking to the security staff. this wasnt just to me this was universal , he did it to everyone wether you was english , spanish german or french.the food was bland with no taste and what did look okay tasted horrible. i tied to ring england but was told i needed to purchase a phone card from the mini market. i purchased the card for 8 dollars and went to reception. i was then told i would have to wait as there was only one phone for customers. the then asked me for a dollar they said this was a conection fee that everyone has got to pay , so i paid it. the dialed the number for me but my mother back home in england wasnt there so i rang my sisters house in england for this they asked me for another dollar. they said if the phone rings on the other side you pay regardless of if you talk to anyone or not.the second week the weather was bad due to bad weather in the gulf. no ones fault at all .but it didnt help that when you was eating your meal you was being rained on . the roof kleaked that bad you had to paddle through the water.this was the same in the theatre when you watched the shows. one poor french lady slipped on the wet floor and fell on her face . when we seen her the next morning she had been to the doctores she had a black eye and a cut face. not very good at all.this was the same in the blocks . they wwas clean and tidy but when it rained they became like an ice rink. my daughters all fell at different times and so did one of the maids or worked there.we have been to the dominican before with airtours and had a great time . in fact i wished we had gone back to the bahi principe. this hotel was 2 star not 4 star like they say. the only good point is the beach is perfect, paradise even.the complex was nice to look at . and the entertainers was out of this world.all of them made the evenings something to look forward to. they had so much energy and time for everyone. its a shame the rception staff didnt take a leaf out of there book.i would like to say for those of you that are thinking god what a moaner. i have been going abroad now since 1996 every year sometimes twice a year and never complained once about anywhere we have ever been .Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.I booked my 24th birthday trip to Vegas for the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino because I LOVE Rock 'n' Roll music and the culture that surrounds it. I got a really good deal on the hotel's website for 2 nights, for a non-smoking King, and it is usually kind of pricey. I was a bit hesitant to use this hotel being off the strip but the website said that there was a free shuttle to and from the strip so I figured that would compensate for not being able to walk out onto the strip from the hotel. We got there about 11pm (drove 4 hours from Riverside, CA) and I heard the guy checking in at the desk in front of us and the guest services person was telling him about a deposit for however many days he is staying and also what the hotel offered, where everything is, what events are going on around the hotel etc. I kind of got nervous because we planned this trip on a low budget but when I approached my guest services woman she promised me that my TOTAL was only 177.80 and that amount would be charged to my card but my card would also be on file for any incidentals. She didn't tell us about the hotel at all though, just gave us our keys and told us where the elevator was. I thought that was kind of weird.... When we got up to our room it was a 2 Queen room. I was bummed. I called down and they said they ran out of Kings and it is first come first serve. Ok, I guess I understand that. I was told they could switch me tomorrow and put a room on hold for me and all I had to do was call or go down to the desk the next morning. When the next morning rolled around I called down and they put my on a "brief hold" which ended up being over 10 minutes so we just decided to go down to the desk. After waiting in line for about 20-30 mins we were told our room wasn't ready and someone would call my phone when it was. So my boyfriend and I decided to catch the free shuttle to the strip to get breakfast. We went out in front of the hotel and didn't see anything obvious to where the shuttle would be so we asked someone at the hotel. The lady working there told us that they don't do the shuttle anymore but the Hard Rock Cafe does which is in the parking lot. No big deal. We walked over there and saw a shuttle bus parked and empty in the lot. We went to the front of the restaurant and there was a sign that said it only runs on the weekends as of 12/14. Well, this was a Wednesday. We were shafted on our "free shuttle" which is also billed by the hotel as a "resort fee" of $7/day. In protest I wasn't about to pay a taxi so we decided to walk the mile. I am a pretty healthy 24 yr old girl and I don't mind a nice walk. I actually expect it up and down the strip but the fact that we were promised a shuttle on the website and not even told that it wasn't running is bull. When we finally made it to breakfast, I checked my bank account on my phone and saw there was only $20 in there. I was SUPER upset. Turns out, the Hard Rock took out over 2x the amount they told me they were going to. I called and they said it was a deposit for incidentals and I was told about it (even though I wasn't by the girl that checked us in). The only way we could release my funds was to have another card to put the deposit on but our family lives in MI so she said she could fax in her card and etc. We ended up walking the 2 miles (from the restaurant) back to the hotel to settle the credit card issue. We were THEN told that my funds wouldnt be released until 8-10 hrs later so basically we would be getting ready to leave by that time and it would be pointless. So, we had walked all the way back for nothing. We checked to see if our room was ready but it still wasnt. So I basically complained my butt off to this guy at the check-in counter (I was polite, but angry) and about the shuttle, he told me that "I'm from NY and I walk everywhere anyways so it doesn't bother ME" WHAT!!? That is what you tell an unsatisfied customer?! Then he told me the hotel isnt even in charge of the shuttle so its not their fault. As far as the rooms go, my reservation request is "NEVER" guaranteed and all he could offer me was a SMOKING King. He claimed that it didnt smell like smoke because they shampooed the carpets regularly. And all he could do to compensate me (after speaking to his Mgr was to refund the $7 resort fee). REALLY!?! I was SOOO upset! My bf was giving me "the look" because he didnt want me to make a scene and we just wanted to move on and enjoy our night. After being tired of walking and arguing with this guy we just settled on the smoking room. We went up there and walked in and it definitely smelled like smoke. I didn't want it to ruin my bday fun so I didn't waste my time. The next day when we went to check out the girl at the counter asked about our stay and I told her I was upset and the reasons why and she told me "Well no one uses the shuttle ANYWAY" and basically tried to make me feel stupid for wanting to use the free shuttle that was promised to me. She also told me "Its because its New Years, its not always like this". So.... what about it being my birthday the day before NYE? Am I just going to get [--] over at this hotel every year if I came back!? THEN on top of it all....she tried to say I used something from the minibar and was going to charge me an extra $4. WTF!? I swear to god... I have NEVER received such bad service from a hotel in Vegas and especially a 4 Star one! I am NOT a complainer at all and am usually a pretty laid-back girl but I felt the need to pass my experience on to everyone looking to stay here... Oh.. and the ONLY good part about this hotel was AGO, their italian restaurant. It was AMAZING and the staff was very friendly. I'm totally open to comments from others if you've received a similar experience or just have any questions for me.Our stay at this hotel was so awful, I frankly don't know where to begin. Each year, my partner and I host a Christmas gathering in New York City for our friends and family. This year, we chose to put everyone up at the W Hotel New York (49th & Lex). What a dreadful mistake. Quick summary: The infrastrucutre in this hotel is tired and failing. Making matters worse, management is ineffective. For those of you who don't have time to read the details that follow, I say run, don't walk, from this hotel. Tired, Failing Infrastructure: The W Hotel New York is old and failing. Three examples: 1. No more than half of the elevators in the hotel were ever in service at the same time during our stay, resulting in long waits and shoulder to shoulder crowding (the elevators in this hotel are absurdly small, at approximately 4 feet square. 2. The room key card lock system failed us during our stay no less than three times (in one instance one of our guests was locked out of his room for an entire evening as the hotel removed the door to his room, jam and all, in order to gain entry). 3. The hot water boiler had to be turned off one morning during our stay, leaving the top floors of the hotel with no hot water (ironically, a large portion of our group arrived that morning, having flown all night on red eye flights, and we had paid for their rooms beginning the evening prior specifically so that they could get in to their rooms early that morning and shower). Ineffective Management: The W Hotel New York features two "penthouse" suites on the 17th floor. My partner and I stayed in one and, to our horror, quickly discovered that the other penthouse suite (it should be noted here that both of these suites share a large, common rooftop deck seperated only by low planters) had been rented out to a major U.S. corporation as a "hospitality" suite for the Nascar race being held in New York that weekend. The result? Non stop partying next door, night after night, with people standing out on the rooftop deck smoking cigarettes and cigars until late into the night. Making matters worse, since the room next door wasn't designed to be a hospitality suite, this meant the door would lock each time it closed. To alleviate this problem, our friends next door would block the door from closing each evening by flipping the lock bar into the door jam. This resulted in the door slamming into the lock bar each time someone came or went (which was constantly throughout each night). But wait. That's not all. The bedroom of our suite shared a (thin) common wall with the service elevators on the 17th floor, which meant that each morning, after being kept up late into the night, we'd awake to the housekeeping staff coming and going (it should be noted here that this issue was pointed out to the manager on duty, who at first refused to believe me when I told him our room backed up to the service elevator -- incredible!). All of the issues I've discussed above, including the service elevator issue, were reported to hotel management. Unfortunately, management was unable to correct any of these issues. The room next door was rented, Nascar related parties were planned, and there was no turning back. The best they could do was promise to monitor the situation (which, unfortunatley, they didn't do). There are two final insults to all of this. First, in the closing days of our stay, management offered to reduce the rate on our room (I quote his words here) "by 50%, or $900.00 per night, which results in a total savings of $5,400" in consideration of the issues we faced with our neighbors throughout our stay. In response to this gesture, I told the manager that I appreciated the offer but nevertheless wanted him to understand I hadn't come to the hotel in search of cheap rooms. To the contrary, I would rather see management correct the mistakes. With this as background, imagine my surprise when we went to check out and discovered that the promised credit hadn't been put on our bill. When I inquired, this manager told me he decided not to do it because I had told him I wasn't there for "cheap rooms." When I protested, he argued with me, ultimately agreeing to credit $900 (50% of one night). As we stood to miss our flight, we didn't have time to argue further and left. Second, after spending nearly an hour checking out, we went to leave the hotel -- now running late for our flight. The bellman had stored our bags in a baggage room behind the front desk. Unfortunately, the card lock system was acting up again. We waited 15 minutes while he tried to get into that room. About the time we were ready to leave the hotel without our bags so as not to miss our flight, our bags appeared. Never again.My husband and I just returned from Hacienda Tres Rios after attending a wedding. We did not choose your hotel but the Wedding was taking place at your resort and the entire group was staying there and it was convenient to be in the same location as everyone. The positive about Hacienda Tres Rios is the beauty and cleanliness of the outdoor locations available to the guests. The pool area and the lounging beds on the beach were wonderful and the beachfront was kept clean and debris free. The bed in our hotel room, even though we did not receive a king bed was comfortable and provided a nice place to lay our head at night. The steps the management is taking to keep the hotel green and environmentally friendly are commendable and the staff was always quick with a “hola” wherever you went. Unfortunately, that’s where my positive comments end and my challenges begin. The remainder of our stay was very disappointing. I must first preface my comments with the fact that my husband and I returned from a trip to The Dreams Resort in Puerto Vallarta in February. The two hotels are on opposite ends of the spectrum which is certainly not what we expected, given the price we paid was comparable. That was the only thing Hacienda Tres Rios had in common with Dreams Puerto Vallarta. It all began at check-in when there was only one person at the front desk checking in guests when they should have been aware of the arrivals for the day and been staffed appropriately. We were expecting a welcome drink upon our arrival when exiting the vehicle, like we did at Dreams, but instead had to chase down a waiter that was walking aimlessly around the lobby with the signature drink. There were fresh moist towels behind the front desk that once again we were expecting to be handed upon check in (like Dreams) but they just sat there and never got offered to any guests. They must be for the Front Desk staff and Bellmen to use throughout their long exhausting day. All over the resort the service was non-existent unless you tipped heavily. We booked the Endless Luxury All-Inclusive plan for the value and convenience it offered and it clearly states on your website that service tips and taxes are included. We definitely are not against tipping when the service warrants it and in fact tipped heavily on our Dreams vacation, but at Hacienda Tres Rios we consistently got our own drinks and food no matter if we were at the pool or on the beach. In our book tips are earned, not expected! Service was consistently slow or non-existent in the outlets as well. One incident I remember vividly was during breakfast at the Casa Las Islas buffet at 8am when the restaurant was not even half full we were seated and waited 10 minutes without any servers approaching us. After getting frustrated, I proceeded to get up and pour my husband and me our own coffee and my own mimosa. When the server did arrive he didn’t look surprised at all and didn’t even apologize for the wait or lack of service. We had another disappointing encounter in the Mexican restaurant, El Alebrije on our last evening. We arrived at 6:30pm when the restaurant opened and there were only 4 other tables occupied by resort guests. We were seated and waited 15 minutes to even be approached by any servers to give us water and take our drink order. We finally ordered our three course dinner at 7pm, an appetizer, Soup and Main Entrée. Our first course arrived 45 minutes later and was to be a hot appetizer and it was ice cold. Our second course was skipped completely (not at our request) perhaps it was just too much for them to handle. When the main course finally arrived the veal was overcooked, crispy and cold as well. At this point we left the restaurant and told the hostess of our disappointment. An hour later, we received a call from the Restaurant Manager apologizing and offering us a free dinner! Did you get that, A FREE DINNER . . . remember we booked an Endless Luxury All-Inclusive plan, how generous of him! Perhaps he could have taken a little time to research our reservation and not have made such a ridiculous offer to us the evening prior to our departure. All around the food was mediocre at best and honestly we get better Mexican food locally here in Colorado. However, we did have one spectacular dinner at the Porto Bello Italian restaurant. The service was good, the waiter was pleasant and the food was delicious. Unfortunately, it couldn’t make up for the other unfortunate dinning experiences. The guest room halls were always littered with room service dishes and we often would see the same dishes in the halls for up to 24 hours. We had to get our own amenities from the housekeeping carts since they are strictly one use each due to their small size and the housekeeper did not replace daily. Our room was consistently not made-up until at least 4pm and one evening we came back from a day at the pool, showered, changed for dinner and had to go to the front desk at 6:30pm and request our room be cleaned. There was always a moldy stench in the air that we could not get rid of, and clothes never really dried due to the humidity. All of our clothes returned home with a horrible smell . It was just an all around disappointing trip. Perhaps the part that truly upsets me the most is during the wedding reception we attended, I glanced up to notice the Bride cutting her own wedding cake while the servers stood at the bar chatting. Please tell me this is not your policy. I am a Wedding Coordinator myself and was appalled at this site. I quickly took charge and cut and plated the cake as your servers ever so graciously held out plates for me – seriously? I finally put the knife down and politely asked they finish with serving the cake. I am from a Hospitality background of over 15 years and perhaps this is the reason I am so critical of service and attention to detail. Perhaps, we were unlucky and just caught your staff on a bad week, or maybe you were short staffed due to illness. I don’t feel these to be true, but I do sincerely believe your hotel has some serious service issues and your employees need to be reprogrammed that no matter what kind of tips come their way (if any) each and every guest deserves to be treated equally, their needs met, and more importantly exceed all expectations! Being a Wedding Coordinator I frequently have brides that are looking for destination weddings and I am positive that Hacienda Tres Rios will not be one that they choose. I wish your property success in the future!Took couple of days to calm down so I can write a review based solely on facts, and not emotions. 1. Property positions itself as "luxury", which is far from the truth, I would say that on scale of 1 to 5 stars, Villas Sacbe is 3 firm ... Mind this, it was built 17 years ago, the quality of craftsmanship, perhaps, at that time was 5 stars and luxury, when there was nothing to compare to, but in 2012, it is not luxury at all, I would say it is more of an average in line with lower class inns 2. The proximity to the beach is unbeatable, I have to state that for the record, the fact that you can use Indigo Beach for free is a great savings perk - however, since it is located on the high intersection point, forget about having a peaceful enjoyment ... Indigo Beach is located in the area where fishing boats are parked, and so you know, they use an older technique of anchoring the boat - ropes, anchors, cement blocks in the water ... To compare, walking 15 minutes either left or right would get you to a better beach, with better access to the water, no boats, no ropes in the water to watch for .. I think you get the picture .. 3. Use of gym facilities - not bad, equipment is clean, in working condition, four flat screen TVs, two would be running MTV music (same channel on both screens), however the reception was not the best and it is hard to work out when the music constantly goes in and out, so we opted to working out using our ipods ... 4. Cleanliness of the room - inn level, not luxury by any means ... Towels are overused and tired; ones day we decided to eat on the patio - and noticed that the cleaning crew has left their cleaning tools and chemicals, along with a plastic bag filled with clean and dirty towels right on our patio ... Well, I have stayed in some 5+ start hotels and never ones have I seen something like this ... 5. Indigo Cafe by the Beach - food is not bad, but not your greatest either ... I can understand that they are tailoring their menu to the satisfy largely American population, but french fries on the beach? You gotta be kidding me ... And fresh juices: only two potions - orange or grapefruit ... To compare, when I was staying in Dubai, even the cheapest road cafe had an impressive fresh juice stand with you-name-they've-got it combinations available ... Can't say, however, that Indigo Cafe is overpriced ... Compared to other places, it is not super expensive ... 6. Waiters - it would greatly vary on who get to serve you ... Some speak English and some don't ... but one day the electric power went out and the waiter serving us calculated our food using a piece of paper .. all of a sudden everything was 5-10 pesos more, we just happened to order exactly the same items we did the day before, but our check was 50 pesos more ... 7. Front desk - keep in mind that if you are staying in Villas Sacbe, you are still to required to check in at Porto Playa, which is a short walk down the street ... We checked in without any issues ... The checking out, however was a different story ... Since we don't speak Spanish, it can be frustrating talking to the companies that serve English speaking clients, but don't have staff who speaks English ... We cam to the "reception" asking for help when we were trying to call our transfer ride to the airport ... It is too bad, I did not get the name of the girl who was helping us ... She listened to what we were after, took the number, called the company and told us that "They are closed, but there is a cell phone number to call, try that" ... We said, we don't speak Spanish and needed her help, as the recoding on the answering machine was in Spanish ... She called the cell phone number, spoke briefly to someone and than hung up saying that she was told that the transfer operator did not have a record of our reservation ... So much for help there ... We were not able to get hold of our transfer operator that day, and decided to wake up early next morning and try calling them again - she told us, that their recording said their business hours was from 9am-5pm ... Our flight was at noon, so we though that if we call them at 9am, we would still be able to make it to the airport fine .. So we go to the reception to check out, she greets us with a smile and says "Your taxi driver was here at 8am, he waited for your and left, because you were not around, but if you want to, we can arrange transportation for you and that would be $150" ... To say that I was furious is to say nothing at all ... I had to restrain myself from using profanity, but all I really wanted to say, you stupid b**ch, we were here yesterday and you knew were not able to get hold of them, why in the world did you not call the room when the taxi was there at 8am? Yes, the transfer operator and the condo are not related, but hiring an idiot to run a reception, com'n now ... We called the transfer operator one more time at 9am, and were told that no taxi was coming for us, since we missed our driver at 8am - my question as to why they picked 8am for a pick up time, not 7am, not 7:30am was left unanswered ... And to add an insult to the injury we were told "You are in Mexico and we don't have to speak English" ... needless to say, Villas Sacbe or any other property under http://www.condohotelsplayadelcarmen.com/ won't be having us back in the future ... 8. Last but not least - one of the contributors mentioned that proximity to the night clubs ... To provide you with more accurate picture image a street lined up with six night clubs, with Mandala Playa topping the sound system ... The party goes on until 6am, and as much as I respect others right to party, it is impossible to sleep ... To sum it up ... we paid $290 per night ... got front desk that was less than helpful .. could not sleep until 6am ... not a hint of luxury if you ask me .... the only positive outcome of this trip was that we now know where we don't want to stay on our next trip to Playa del Carmen, 'cause we absolutely loved the place minus the boutique-condo experience .. Thank you for reading, hopefully it will help others to make an educated decision ...I want to be fair. The hotel is in a great location, especially if you're gay like me. It's in the gay area of town. If that's your prime criteria then by all means consider the hotel. However, I would not stay at this hotel again. I stayed 11/7/07 through 11/10/07 (today). Please beware! There is major construction on-going on the entire first floor of the hotel. They didn't tell me about it when I made my reservation a month ago. Judging by the enormity of the project you should expect it to be on-going throughout the winter. They moved the lobby out into the foyer and set up some tables to substitute for a front desk. You literally have to wind your way through a maze of scaffolding to get from the "lobby" to the elevators, restaurant, and other exits. Seriously, I'm pretty certain it violates fire codes. There's no way what they set up is safe. Only one person can fit through the maze at a time. If someone is coming the other way with luggage you have to back out to the lobby and wait for them to pass. It may sound minor but it's not. The noise is very loud all day long. They start early in the morning. The walls are thin at this hotel. I wish they had posted this on their web site or at least told me when I made my reservation a month ago. I would have either stayed somewhere else or asked for a discount on the room, which I very much deserved and still do deserve. I was on the 2nd floor right above the construction and it had a hugely negative impact on my stay. I don't really know what others who have posted here mean about the friendly hotel staff. I did not experience that kind of treatment at all. I'm a pleasant enough person. I'm reasonable. The hotel was pretty much empty but they would not move me to another room when I checked in. I know it was empty because they had a board of room keys hanging on the wall behind the check-in table and it was practically full of keys. There were plenty of alternative available rooms. I was perplexed but figured I'd give the room a chance because they called it a "suite." Well, it was pretty awful and calling it a suite is pretty funny. If this room was a suite then all Motel 6 rooms are suites. Please be aware that there are no amenities in the rooms; the floor-board heaters did not work. I asked for them to fix it but they said the repairman wasn't available and I never heard from them again. There is no coffee maker, no mini-fridge, one small 3-draw dresser under the TV, a very old TV with a broken remote control that was obviously purchased from another hotel, a tiny closet, and a window that would only stay open with a wooden slat placed under it to hold it up. I was afraid I might start a fire when I plugged my cell phone charger into the wall because the outlet looked like it had been installed in 1940. The carpet was old and dirty. I gave it the white sock test (walked around for a bit in my socks) and it failed. My socks were dirty. The worst was the mattress! Oh my! I woke up every morning with a back ache and that's not something I normally have problems with. I can sleep on a log, but the mattress was somehow worse than that. They said the bed was a queen-sized! It wasn't! It was a full-size! Hysterically funny that they would think people are that stupid. To get ice, you have to go to the lobby and ask for an ice bucket. There is one ice machine and it's in the "lobby" (foyer). Housekeeping took the ice bucket out of the room everyday. There is one soda machine in the lobby but the only button that worked was diet coke. None of the other drinks were available. There is no snack machine anywhere in the hotel. There's no continental breakfast. No coffee in the lobby (foyer). There's no gift shop/amenities shop and the nearest drug store is a 1/4 mile away. There were only two small glasses in the entire room. That's it - not even plastic cups. They don't use real bath towels. They are those half-size towels that feel like they were washed in sand and dried in an oven. Instead of preserving the architecture of the building, they put in generic drop-ceilings and painted the walls awful colors. It's NOT a boutique hotel or "quaint" as some have posted here. It's a mish-mosh of delapitated construction, path-work fixes, and borrowed furnishings. The very worst part of my experience was last night. I needed to check-in for my flight 24-hours in advance. They have a single PC in the lobby for guest use. They have wireless access throughout the hotel but my laptop isn't wireless enabled (something else they didn't tell me - they just said, "Yes, we have internet access"). Ha. I used (or, attempted to use) the lobby PC 4 times during my stay. It was only working on two of those occasions. Last night when it wasn't working I asked the woman at the foyer check-in table to help me. She came over, tried it, and it wasn't connecting to the internet. She said, "Let me check my PC." (which was 5 feet away) She said, "Mine's working fine." I asked, "Can I use your PC to check-in online?" explaining that I had to do it ASAP to get a good seat on my flight. She wouldn't let me use her PC! I explained to her that I was a guest at the hotel (giving her one last chance to redeem the hotel and my terrible experience) and that I would very much appreciate it if she'd let me use it this one time. She started to tell me why she couldn't do that but I interrupted her and asked if there was an internet cafe nearby. She said, "Sure. Just go around the block..." Well, that was yet another lie. The internet cafe she directed me to was a 1/2 mile walk. At this point my partner and I had had it. So, I'm confused regarding the so-called friendly service others encountered at the hotel. They didn't even smile at us or say hello when we checked in! You may ask why we stayed after the first night. It was a personal decision. We were on vacation and we had plans and tours to take so our time was limited. We didn't want to have to endure the hassle of finding another hotel, packing up our stuff, and going somewhere else. We figured it was just 3 nights. Now, we regret that. We should have left after the first night. I realize some of this sounds harsh. But it's all true. This site is about sharing experiences and mine were not good. When I encounter a great hotel I document it here. Read my other reviews. This post isn't about trashing a hotel. It's about letting others know my experience and hopfully saving someone else from the terrible time we had.personally i say save your money.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.We went to Maui and chose the Grand Wailea as our hotel because of the great location and the fact that it had such a great pool with water slides and a lazy river. We have two kids ages 5 and 6. We are easy going, physically fit people who enjoy playing with our children and spending time outside. Here are the pros and cons of this hotel: Pros: 1-Great location... the other parts of the island had several days of very high winds. The beach at the Grand Wailea had winds, too, but we could still swim in the ocean and play on the beach. It was still warm and nice. 2-The pool has many things for kids to do. There is something for everyone. 3- The workout facilities were great. Cons: 1- Upon check in our room was still dirty from the people who stayed there before us. when we complained, they did fix it and said they'd comp our breakfast. 2- We went to the Grand Buffet for the "comped" breakfast, ate and left. It was not grand at all for over a hundred dollars. Then, the breakfast charge appeared on our hotel bill and stayed instead of being "comped" as we were told it would be. Toward the end of the trip it still did not come off until we went down to talk to someone. They still would not take it off until my husband started to get very mad and there was a line of people waiting to check in. Then they took it off. If you stay at this hotel we recommend going next door to the Four Seasons for breakfast. Their buffet was much more impressive with a lot more choices for the same price as that at the Grand Wailea 3- The hotel hallways are filthy. The carpet is just nasty, not just old, but nasty dirty. There was the same dirty half empty cocktail glass accompanied by an empty plastic juice bottle that sat on the console table by the elevator for 3 straight days before someone cleaned it up.... and that is just getting started.... 4- It takes a very long time to walk back to your room if you forget something because the place is so big. 5-They don't have nearly enough pool chairs or beach umbrellas to accommodate. We witnessed fights over the chairs and you have to get up and get in line at 7 am to get your chair and then wait until 8 when the umbrella's stand opens and tip someone to carry it out to the beach for you unless you want to do it yourself. The only people who get "poolside" service for beverages and food are those who "rent" the cabanas. Cabanas cost extra. ALL others must walk up to the poolside cafe/bar and stand in that line to get their own drinks and food and carry them back to the pool spot or beach spot they are sitting. And it is crazy at that place. 6- the pool water was cloudy every day that we were there. It did not look the way a pool should look. 7- The "family" bathroom did not lock when we were there-Easter week... I was walked in on two different times when I was in there with our kids, a boy and a girl. Also, there is only 1 family bathroom. For a hotel this size it is not enough in my opinion especially when single people with no kids go in the family bathroom because they don't want to wait in the line at the men's or women's bathrooms right next door. 8-The hotel staff takes down the chairs at the beach to put them away before 6 pm. So if you plan to watch the sunset on the beach you won't be able to sit in a chair while your kids play in the sand to do that. 9-If there is a little wind at the beach, the hotel staff doesn't just put down the umbrellas until it stops, they take them down and take them away for the rest of the day. A baby was taking his nap at the umbrella next to me and they still took down the umbrella and left him with no shade. At 1 o'clock in the afternoon...... 10- When we were there the hotel pool deck did not get cleaned off. It was slimy and gross the whole time. In addition to the debris floating int he pools, and the cloudy pool water, we saw debris floating in the hot tub and were not sure if it was something from a coconut tree or poop. The pool was not very clean. 11-The women's restroom by the pool smelled horrendous the entire time we stayed at the hotel. It was not maintained during the day, I don't know if it was at night or not, but anytime I used it during the day whether it was first thing in the morning or not, it was ridiculously dirty and smelled like urine. 12- I made an appointment for a pedicure and manicure at the "grand spa". The appointment was supposed to be for 2 pm on the Saturday before Easter. I had asked them to write it on a card because they seemed very distracted and casual about the appointment when I made it. It was a good thing I asked them to write it on a card because the next day when I was supposed to be there for my appointment they told me I didn't have one. Then, when I showed them the card they couldn't have been nicer but told me it was for noon in the computer not 2 pm like they told me and wrote down on the card. Unbelievable. They were booked and the only time they could get me in was Easter Sunday morning at 9 am. We went to church so I said no thanks. 13-Another thing about the pool- if you swim later in the afternoon don't forget to get a towel. The towel stand closes promptly at 6 pm. If you are swimming with your kids after that and didn't get a towel right away, you will have to walk through the lobby all the way to your room in your suits dripping wet. 14- Another thing about the food- we paid 30 dollars for 2 kids' meals at the pool side bar/restaurant. The kids' meals were a hot dog (or other choice of main entree), a small bag of oreo cookies, a jello cup, a bag of chips and a capri sun. The capri suns were served warm all 4 times I got my kids a kids' meal. The jello was not jelled. It was like it sat in the sun from another kid's meal and liquified or something until it made it back to the lunch shack and got put in our bucket. This happened all the times we got kids' meals for our kids at the pool. One time, I first waited 15 minutes in line to order the food. Then, was rudely told by the bartender, the kitchen was really "backed up" and it would be a 1/2 hour until they'd be ready. So, I came back 1/2 hour later and there was still a long line. In short....we were disappointed. We did visit other hotels in the same beach area to compare food, cleanliness and pool and service. But mainly we visited the other hotels just to get out of the Wailea to eat. There was no comparison. The Grand Wailea is not grand and it is dirty inside and out at the pool. For the same money you could go to the Four Seasons, the Fairmont or even the Marriot. Their pools were not cloudy, their staff was all friendly and the food was much better. For a 100 dollars for breakfast you want it to feel like 100 dollars. The four seasons breakfasts felt like 100 dollars, at least. Grand Wailea was not only dirty, but it was old and worn. It was not worth the money. I would not recommend this hotel, and we will never go there again. Although we love Maui and next time we will stay at the Four Seasons, the Fairmont or the Marriot.My husband and I were in Mexico between May 27 - June 10th of this year for our wedding / honeymoon. The first 8 nights of our trip were spent at the resort where we had our wedding, which was an absolutely perfect experience in every way. During our vacation planning, we opted to move to the Shangri-La Caribe during the middle of our vacation for a change of scenery, and regretted our decision to do so almost immediately. The day we arrived at the Shangri-La, my husband had become very ill. Checkout time at our previous resort was at noon, so when we arrived at the Shangri-La, he wanted nothing more than to lie down, however, check-in wasn't until 3:00. We asked the front desk staff if there was any way we could check in early and were told our room wouldn't be ready until 3:00. We got that, thought it would be worth asking, and went off to kill a few hours until the room was ready. We came back at 2:45 to check again as he was really starting to feel poorly by this time, and were told that it would be ready at exactly 3:00. At exactly 3:00, the gentleman that had told us our room would be ready got off shift and left, without saying a word to us (we were sitting in the lobby waiting until 3:00 as my husband had had enough of walking around at that point). At 3:05, I asked the person behind the front desk about our room and was told that it wouldn't be ready for another hour. In fact, we were not able to check into our room until 5:00 that evening, thus beginning our frustration with this resort. When we were finally able to get into the room (we rented a beachfront bungalow - 34P), we immediately turned on the A/C as the heat was stifling. Unfortunately, with the high ceilings of the beachfront bungalows, the A/C units are totally inadequate to even remotely cool the rooms down, so if you reserve one of these units, prepare to be hot. We resorted to opening up all of the windows (there are a lot of them) and if there is a good breeze going it's not bad, but if there's no breeze, good luck. The next thing we discovered with the room was that the palapa roofs are utterly infested with thousands and thousands of tiny insects. I practically bathed in bug repellent, including covering the sheets and pillows, but was still eaten alive that night by the insects. The next morning I was covered in hundred of tiny bug-bites, so we decided to pay the front desk a visit to inquire as to what they could do about the bug infestation, and were told that we could move next door to 35P. When we asked if we could expect more bugs in 35P, they staff told us that the current occupants of that room hadn't complained about the bugs. We then asked if the bugs were usually a problem and they told us very frankly yes, the bugs are a big problem due to the thatched roofs. We opted to have our room fumigated as opposed to moving to a new room that more than likely had the same issues, and were told it would take no longer than an hour. We vacated the room, and when we came back to the room several hours later, it was very clear that the room had been fumigated, as all of the furniture was covered in sheets and there were thousands of insect carcasses everywhere, however, they had neglected to send someone to clean up the horrendous mess afterward. Back to the front desk we go (no phones in the room, so if you're having issues, plan on a lot of walking back and forth) to ask for housekeeping to clean up the mess and unfortunately, we weren't able to use our room until 6:00 that evening. Later that night we went into Playa for dinner and when we returned at roughly 9:30, the bug situation was even worse than before - with hundreds of these insects all over our pillows and sheets. We marched down to the front desk yet again and told them in no uncertain terms would we be staying in the room another night to be devoured in our sleep, and asked about having our money refunded so we could find another place to stay. We were told that the manager wouldn't be in until 9:00 the next morning, and that until she was the only person with the authority to refund our money, but that they would be glad to move us to another room without a palapa roof for the night. She also suggested that refunding the difference to us between the beachfront bungalow and the "Ocean View" room wouldn't be a problem at all, but that a refund was unlikely. We decided to move to the new room to give it a shot, and found that while this room (sans palapa roof) didn't have the tiny insects of the other room, it did have roaches, as well as an A/C unit that dripped water on us all night, and loud construction that began promptly at 8:00 AM. Good times. At promptly 9:00 AM the next morning we made yet another trip to the front desk to meet with the manager, who didn't bother to show up until 9:20. At 9:30, one of the front desk staff came to tell us (mind you, she couldn't be bothered to come speak to us herself) that the manager was suddenly called into a staff meeting and wouldn't be available for another 40 minutes. We went and had breakfast (contrary to what many other posters have said with regard to the breakfast, we were not at all impressed) and then back to the front desk to wait for the manager. When she finally did come speak to us, to her credit, she was very apologetic and accommodating; at first she offered to find us yet another room, refund the first two nights to us, and refund the difference between the beachfront bungalow and the new room. After a few moments of deliberation, we decided to cut our losses and asked for a full refund; we were just not confident that we would be able to relax and be comfortable there, and we were quickly burning through our honeymoon days. In the end, Turquoise Reef (their booking agent?) found us another property in downtown Playa Del Carmen, refunded the first two nights at the Shangri-La to us, as well as refunding the difference between the Shangri-La and the new property, as the new property wasn't located directly on the beach and was quite a bit less expensive. Again, to their credit, for upset as we were with the Shangri-La and our experience there, we felt that in the end, they made it right. I was so looking forward to our stay at the Shangri-La and was incredibly disappointed. I'm amazed that the issues that we ran into haven't been more of an issue among other guests. We truly aren't hard to please when it comes to a hotel, honestly, the first resort we stayed at was incredible, and the hotel that we ended up staying at in lieu of the Shangri-La turned out the be fantastic as well...I guess 2 out of 3 isn't bad?Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.You'll Love it...or hate it!! I debated giving this place only 1 star because it wasn't entirely terrible, but there were enough negative incidents that I could not recommend it. I visited Bahia Principe with some friends and my extended family for a wedding in June. I called the resort several weeks before arrival to confirm that my extended family would all be able to stay together even though we had booked through separate travel agencies. When I arrived, the front desk immediately tried to separate us (and take us to separate lobbies) even though some of my relatives did not speak Spanish or English. The front desk staff were INCREDIBLY rude and inflexible. I was told, My friend: You are in gold are, they are in diamond area...end of story. Do not try to argue. You get in your shuttle and they get in the other! Then the bell hops forcefully tried to separate our luggage and carry us on separate shuttles to our rooms. After that, they lost our luggage because it was not tagged and brought to another area of the resort (the resort is huge). Eventually my wife and I WERE separated (while I was trying to work things out at the front desk my wife jumped on a shuttle with a porter as he tried to drive off with her non-English/Spanish speaking relatives and some of our luggage to only God knows where). It took a full two hours before we found each other again. Until that time, I was not allowed to check in because they needed my wife's passport number and signature and needed to put the all inclusive bracelet on her wrist. By the end of the first night I was seething with anger at the way I had been treated. I'll mention some good points before I get on with my complaints: The sewage smell that people complain about was not bad and only in a very limited area of the resort. Most of the staff (waiters, bartenders, cleaning staff, maintenance staff, concierge staff) were friendly and polite. The grounds and rooms were clean and well maintained. The lobby was very attractive. The food in the common dining areas was not bad. The beach was beautiful. Many in our party had a great time participating in activities at the pools/beach and socializing with others and enjoyed the spa services. To be sure, there were some in our party that had a great time at Bahia Principe and who didn't have any issues...they were the few lucky ones. One minor complaint I had: the resort is not all inclusive. I have stayed at a few all-inclusive resorts and this was definitely only partially-inclusive. A safe is extra charge, certain liquors are extra charge, if you drink the stock of beverages in your room (2 beers, 2 diet pepsi, 2 waters, 1 orange soda) and want replacements before the next day it is an extra charge, room service is extra charge (in most areas of the resort), many water activities (which were not at other all inclusives I have stayed at) are extra charge, and drinks at the wedding reception were extra charge (this was not the case at other location weddings I have been to) and I understand drinks in the casino were also extra charge, and late checkout (even 10 minutes) is extra charge. I would not waste a meal eating at the Japanese restaurant...it was far from gourmet. I won't go so far as to say it was inedible, but many in our group left their meals half-eaten. During our stay we ate at almost all the a la carte restaurants and were mostly unimpressed. Despite the fact that the staff wore tuxedos and male guests were required to wear long pants (jeans and t-shirt is acceptable -- polo shirt and fancy shorts are not) the food was not much better than the food in the main common dining areas located in the lobbies. With the exception of the Japanese restaurant, the a la carte restaurant food was not 'bad', but it was not delicious by any means. I was particularly offended by the host of the seafood restaurant who actually put his hand on my chest and tried to push me out because he thought I did not have a reservation (it was part of a group reservation). It was his misunderstanding, but he was very, very impolite both in his tone and his actions. I was utterly shocked that he could get away with treating his guests in such a manner. He was not only impolite to me, but also to another member of our party who lodged a formal complaint against him after we left. Although individuals tried to be helpful, overall service at the resort was mediocre at best. For example, we requested an ironing board from housekeeping and were told it would be there right away. It never came. We requested from the front desk and were told it would be there in 15 minutes. We waited and it never came. We called back and were told it was on its way...it never came. We requested it from the concierge and were told it would be sent later that day...never came. Finally we requested one in broken Spanish and hand signals to one of the housekeepers and she used the radio to call for one which came in about 10 minutes. Our toilet was clogged on the last day and it never got fixed. Many others in our party had similar issues. If you request a special service, flowers, champagne, extra towels, another blanket or pillow...it may never arrive and there is no reasonable system for voicing complaints to a manager...because there didn't seem to be a person in a position of authority who had the power to make things happen. The wedding we came for started more than an hour late because the shuttles that were supposed to pick up the wedding party didn't show up. If you MUST stay at this resort, some practical advice: mosquito spray and sunscreen is a good idea, lots of US 1$ bills for tips are useful, walkie talkies are great for keeping track of others in your party on the spacious resort grounds, mixed drinks in the lobby bar are better than other bars, small towel or handkerchief for wiping the wet seats in the shuttle are handy if you're wearing nicer clothes for dinners, and show up on time for your dinner reservations or you will be refused admittance (even though your reservation cannot be given to someone else) I'm not someone who is accustomed to receiving the very best service...I don't normally stay at the Four Seasons or the Ritz or fly any class other than coach. I don't consider myself a connoisseur of fine food or wines, and I don't usually have a problem if tasks are done on island time, but I found this resort utterly substandard. The facilities are nice and most of the staff were friendly, but the resort seemed to lack the organizational skills or proper training to properly take care of their guests. I can't say if it deserves its #2 popularity ranking because I have not stayed at other resorts in the Dominican Republic, but I would certainly not recommend it and I will definitely never go back. I was prepared for the odd mishap, a sewage smell, mosquitoes and possibly even food poisoning (some in our party got really sick), but I could not prepare for the rude welcome I received and poor service that I experienced.Stay somewhere else! Upon arrival at the Hotel Occidental there was astrong storm in progress. After check-in we wereinstructed to leave our bags with the bell boy. Wewere told that our bags would be taken to our room. WeHOWEVER had to walk in strong rain and gusty winds toour room. The walk took us over 15 minutes (primarilybecause we were unfamiliar with the area and had noguidance) and we were soaked. Finally when we didreach our building #25 the bell boy was already there.(He had travelled in a golf cart) I do not understandwhy we were not offered transportation WITH the bellboy given the weather conditions.We did not have hot or warm water in order to takea shower for the first two days, hence we did notshower for two days at the start of our trip. In theevening after our arrival, I attempted to call thefront desk to alert them of this problem. NO ONEanswered the front desk. I then walked to thereception desk, NO ONE was at the front desk. Thefollowing morning on Sunday, I again called the frontdesk, NO ONE answered. I then walked to the front deskin the lobby and expressed my concern. I wasinstructed to go and talk with someone else at anotherdesk. After waiting in line for 10 minutes and beingshuffled from person to person having to repeat myconcerns, I informed a woman that my room did not havehot water. She stated that she would alert someone. Iasked for an estimated time in which the problem wouldbe fixed, she could not give me one. The entire daypassed and we did not have hot water. I inquired twiceagain on the phone and in person in the lobby and wastold that they told someone. Of note, other guestsDID have hot water. On Sunday evening also, I notedthat the toilet was no longer working. I went again tothe lobby and asked if it was possible that the roombe changed. After much discussion and reasons why suchaccommodations were difficult to be made, I wasreluctantly transferred to another room. This roomtoo, did not have hot water, but rather lukewarmwater. Original reservations were made for two beds,there were two adults travelling. Upon arrival in ourfirst room, there was only one bed. I inquired as towhy there were not two beds, and was told that allrooms were booked and that we could only get a cot.The cot took a few hours to arrive and was extremelyuncomfortable. I asked for an extra pillow and waitedseveral hours for this to arrive. When we weretransferred to another room there was one bed. We wereagain given a cot.On sunday we made reservations for excursionsthrough a tour company and our representative Julio.Earlier on I had expressed my dissatisfaction with thehotel facilities and customer service with the frontdesk and was told to talk with my tour representative.I discussed my concerns with Julio and he stated that he would talk with the manager and leave a message in our room withalternate resolutions. I NEVER heard back from Julio.On the day of our excursion we were instructed tobring towels for the (carribean festival). The towelbooth was not open when I went to ask for beach towelsso I inquired with the front desk. We don't havetowels was the response I was given and that I shouldgo to the towel hut on the beach. I explained that Iwent there and it was not open, and was told that Ihad to wait until it opened. The bus for the excursionwas scheduled to leave, so we left with no towels. Theposted times on the towel hut stated that it opened at8am and at 8am it was not open. On another day theexcursion tour to Santo Domingo was scheduled to leaveat 6:45am. The buffets did not open until 7:00am.After arriving in the lobby at 6:30am I asked aboutfood and what those who were scheduled to leave at6:45am should do (the trip was approximately 3 1/2hours drive to Santo Domingo) and was told that thebuffet did not open until 7:00am and that I had towait. After further discussion another tourist foundout from talking to another person that food forexcursions could be ordered 2 days before. It would bein the format of a boxed lunch. NO ONE had given usthis information and no one was willing to provide uswith ANY food. Of note the buffet was set up andready for service, but they would not make anyexception for any of us. There were many of us whowere not informed of the service or how to order foodand no accommodations were going to be made. We weredriven to Santo Domingo on an empty stomach.I attempted to contact the agency with whom we booked our tour through several times from my room and was disconnected or placed on hold for several minutes. I finally left a message on the voice mail and expressed my desperate plea for help. The next day when I did reach someone, I was told that the number that I had given for a return call (the number on the phonein the hotel) was invalid. I was told that there wasa message left for me at the front desk-- there was nomessage at the front desk and or on the phone. Iagain tried to call the travel agency from my room and thephone call was again dropped. I went to the frontlobby and asked to use the lobby desk phone and wasdenied. I spoke with a man named Angel who wasacting manager for the day and after hearing all mygrievances, stated this isn't the United States, wecant do anything for you and you wont get what youwant. Another man behind the desk by the name ofAlex stated I cant help you, I hate this place, itsucks and I'm leaving.Upon arrival it was explained to me that therewere several restaurants and a buffet to eat at. Iattempted to make reservations (which had to be made 2days in advance) and was told that not all restaurantswere open each night. At first we were told that allthe seats for one night was full, but after muchdiscussion, we were reluctantly given a table. Gettingfood was a battle. Information related to makingreservations for dining was not presented at the timeof check in.I attempted to speak with a manager several timesand was always told that he was unavailable. Therewas a card in the hotel room on the nightstand with amessage and contact number from the manager. I attempted to call this number and asked for this man at the lobby, and no one ever knew where he was. Instead I was forced to talk withpeople named Leo, Brigida, and Martha (Martha wasapparently involved in public relations) all who sentme in circles repeating my problems, directing me tovarious other people and spending hours in the lobbywith absolutely no assistance, no compassion and noresolutions. In short, do yourself a favor, stay somewhere else and give yourself a chance to truly enjoy punta cana!Melia Diarrhea Tropical We went with a group of 10 people and I have been home for two days and am finally off of the toilet long enough ,I hope, to write this. Like just about everyone writing about this place, the grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Check in gave us our first glimpse of what was to come. Apparently noone in the DR has ,or ever will utter these four words  May I help you. After waiting to check in for 20 minutes we finally cornered a desk clerk. A resort this size with as many Americans visiting should have at least one staff member fluent in English. It definitely would cut down on the check in times if they could understand us and we understand them. They also need to at very least be able to give us correct information.I think, we were told Royal service was $70 a day per person ( another $2500 for my group of 4, a bit much don't you think , Melia) while another family in our group was quoted $90 a day per person by a different clerk. Never did get an answer on that one. It was after 3:30PM when we arrived at our room only to find the beds unmade and towels on the floor. Any Motel 6 in the world will not let you go to your room if it's not ready but this 4 star just sent you on your way. The room was ok but try to get a first floor room if you still want to go. The second floor rooms have vaulted ceilings and the air just does a minimal job while the first floor rooms were actually cold. One bed was fine while the other was caved in the middle. Maid service was hit or miss. We never did get our fourth towel for 4 people and the room was not made up one day even at 4:30 pm ( four star???).The shower water temp control was non existent (No cold water..nothing like a hot shower on a sunburn) and the toilet filled with scalding hot water when flushed making each and every all too often visit all that much more special. The restaurants were just OK and the food was passable if you could keep it down or in.The manditory reservations are a joke. All the restuarants always had empty tables. The buffet was OK and even had Saltine crackers available for a short time for those of us that couldn't eat anything else. Everyone in our group was in great spirits the first day and wondering what all the negative reports were about .Then.......everyone in our party was sick beginning the second day with vomiting and diarrhea. The kids in our group seemed to bounce back , but the the adults all had a very long week, even with Imodium. Bar service at the pool was also hit or miss. Some days you got your 8oz semi cold drink or beer quickly and other days you just stood and sweat because you didn't exsist. We have to agree with another report posted here about tipping. If your provide decent service a tip is in order ,but in the DR you are expected to tip everyone before they do anything whether it's done correctly or not . Side trips are another adventure. Trips are not refundable unless you call your special agent  the night before your adventure to cancel. That must be why there's a phone on the wall by the toilet. If you are sick the morning of your trip, too bad,most trips leave at 8 am and your special agent doesn't roll in till 9:30. We were told by him that I needed $150 medical excuse from the hotel in order to get a $75 trip refunded...Makes perfect sense to me. Right?! It is a different planet outside the resorts. Apparently in the DR garbage belongs on the side of the road ,if you want to call that pot holed piece of asphalt a road. Public beaches are just another place for locals to dump stoves, refrigs , cars, etc.and set up yet another almost free  tablet of trinkets. In another 5-7 years the whole island will be a land fill. It really is too bad the natives think so little of their paradise. T he beach was ok, however this was the first island in the Carribean that we visited that has ever had seaweed or some type of vegetation washed up on the sand. The pool was OK ,but not refreshing. Could have been cleaner...YUK! The trains to transport you around the compound were sporadic, some days really good and other days not so good and one really needed to be overhauled. Diesel smoke and high temps and humidity make for a less than enjoyable ride. The casino was small and extremely smokey. Can't tell you much about the entertainment because we were usually scrambling back to our rooms after dinner for an Imodium nightcap. Would we go back? hell NEVER! Not for that kind of money. If tourism is going to be the DR's major industry besides tobacco, they 've got a really long way to go as far as service and health issues before they even come close to any of the other carribean islands or cruise lines.This is the letter I send to the GM and never got a response: To the General Manager or whom it may concern (if anyone cares) I would like to tell you about my stay at your hotel: FIRST, I would just like to say the Ocean Waters Spa is WONDERFUL! We had great service and an amazing couples massage there! Its like it was a totally separate entity from the hotel. NOW let me tell you about our experience at your hotel. We had booked our room ( a king bed oceanfront) several weeks in advance from the 28th of May through the 31st of May. It was Memorial Day weekend, I understand that, but for my boyfriend and I it was a special getaway to celebrate our anniversary. I called the front desk in the early afternoon (on the 28th) to let them know that we were driving from the other coast after we got off work and that we would not be able to check in til' after 10pm (We didn't want our room given away). The lady I talked to said it would be fine and that she would make note of that. When we arrived the lady at the check-in counter informed us that we were "upgraded" to a hospitality suite Room #537. When we went in the room we were sorely disappointed! This room smelt musty and damp. We were also really disappointed about the lack of privacy on the balcony and the fact that our room being located behind the pool & tucked away in the corner wasn't really our idea of an oceanfront room (by the way I would like to know what I needed to say when I booked the room besides "oceanfront" to actually get a room on the "oceanfront"). I called the front desk to see about changing rooms to the one I thought we had booked and we were informed that the hotel was full and this was not possible. We then decided it wasn't going to be the end of the world, so we started to unpack our things. Then we saw our second cockroach! The first one we saw upon immediately arriving in the room, and I had mentioned it to the front desk when I had called about changing rooms . The man I had talked to was stuffy and treated me like I was stupid. He said "this is Florida" and "You can't keep them out this time of year." I was thinking "I live in Florida!" and "Yes you can!" I honestly felt like he didn't believe me. I felt like he thought I was making it up to get moved to another room. The third cockroach followed shortly and I called the front desk again and complained, and once again I was treated like I was stupid and like I was supposed to just deal with it! It took a third phone call of dismissal, and then I finally went down to the front desk myself. I respectfully and calmly gave him my grievances. He was still just as smug as he had been on the phone. I couldn't believe his attitude! I was being VERY nice considering the situation and I wasn't being taken seriously at all! He said he would send up the security guard on duty, because he handles all "incidences" at night. The security guard was the nicest man and he totally understood why we were upset with the conditions of the room. He said he would go down to the front desk and see what they could do for us. While he was away we saw ANOTHER cockroach! and then another one! there were even baby ones! We freaked out! How could such a beautiful highly rated hotel be this GROSS! and EXPECT US TO EXCEPT IT! We quickly packed our things! There was NO WAY we were going to sleep in that room. We also smashed two of the cockroaches (although they were still kicking) and put them in a clear bag to show the man at the front desk who was treating me like an idiot . The security guard returned within 10min. and we were all packed up and ready to go when he returned. He said they could move us, and reassured us that the other rooms in your hotel DID NOT have bugs like this one. He said a room like the one we originally thought we were paying for was not available, so we had a choice of two different types of rooms, both of which were inferior to want we had wanted and thought we purchased. We had to make the choice to spend our weekend sleeping in separate beds or looking at the street from the balcony. We went with the oceanfront room #433 and tried to share a small bed all weekend. Our new room was very clean and NOT musty smelling at all, there were no bugs and it was way more what we had expected from this hotel. We made the best of our stay and had no further issues til' Monday the 31st we had ordered room service for breakfast at 10:30. We had requested to pay for late checkout at 3pm. So we wanted to sleep til' around 10:15 or so and wake up and have breakfast at our leisure in our room. We received a call around 9:15 or so rudely awaking us, the lady on the other end of the phone said they had experienced a loss of power and that our room service would not be available that morning. She said that however that were offering a breakfast buffet for a small fee and that it included all of the items that we had requested. I was way too tired and just wanted to forget about it at that point. I told her no thank you and went back to sleep. It was about 10:10 and I was awakened with yet another phone call, the lady said that they could now provide us with the room service we requested. I said "OK". At 10:30 we got our breakfast. Absolutely everything was stone cold as if it had been sitting out. It was either soggy or hard. It was completely inedible. We couldn't even finish it, and we are NOT picky eaters. We paid $41 for that inedible breakfast. We paid for a 3 night stay at your hotel. We paid for late checkout (btw we had 3 knocks on our door by maid's asking if we were checking out late when we told the front desk we were at check in) We paid for parking every day. We spent money at your hotel's spa for massages. We were good customers to your establishment! We never yelled at anyone about these issues. We never caused a scene. We are laid back people. I have NO problem spending money on a vacation, but honestly after that weekend I felt like the Plaza Resort & Spa totally ripped me off! We definitely did NOT get what we paid for. It has been weeks and it still makes me so upset at how nobody cares about stuff like this. That weekend my boyfriend proposed to me and will soon be my husband. It was a very memorable weekend, but the memory is tainted by the difficulties and ill treatment at your hotel. I would NOT recommend this hotel to other people. It's beautiful, has an excellent beach front and great spa, but the customer service at this hotel is THE WORST I have ever experienced. Its like they didn't care if we were even there. That they would rather have us go away and not deal with us, and we didn't do ANYTHING wrong except choose your establishment for our special mini vacation. I have never vented like this about an experience at any place of hospitality before, but this one definitely merits it. I just want someone to make this right by me and my fiance. I just want someone to care. That's all I have to say. Trisha Ann Dickens/Adam C. BoltzM I S L A B E L E D......( H I D D E N  ---  L A B E L L E D )......T E A ?????.I have been a fan of Jasmine Tea for quite a while.  Several years ago,<br />I had my first taste of TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea, and fell in love with the<br />sweet, delicate flavour....totally different from even the "English Breakfast Tea" made by the same company.  Though "English Breakfast Tea",<br />(and "Darjeeling", and even Fortum & Mason's "Royal Blend" tea are different from the usual "Orange Pekoe" or "Orange Pekoe and Black" teas, one usually gets bagged in the supermarket, these other 'rarified' teas are far more like the usual tea than Jasmine Tea.  Jasmine Tea, (at least as made by Twinnings), will always be my total favourite.<br /><br />When I went to purchase some "TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea" through Amazon, they were out of it...thank goodness, as it turns out, temporarily.  I didn't know this at the time...and so, I bought the "substitute" then offered...Sunflower Jasmine Tea.  I figured that Jasmine Tea is Jasmine Tea, no matter who makes it ....right?  And this Sunflower Tea DID seem slightly less expensive....so, I bought some.<br /><br />I have just had my first cup.  It did NOT taste like the Jasmine Tea I so remember and appreciate.  This is a very, very PALE tea in colour....and what is worse, the taste is somewhat peppery, (ulgh!)....with only the VERY slightest hint of the wonderful Jasmine Tea Flavour I remember.<br /><br />WHAT went wrong, I wondered.  HOW could this be so different?  Tea trees<br />should know no nationality or political system!  I was extremely bewildered and confused....for about five minutes.  But I found out the reason, (I think), just before I started to write this review...seeking out the Sunflower Jasmine Tea for which I wanted to write a review.<br /><br />Amongst the "Jasmine Teas" listed are TWO TYPES of Twinnings Jasmine Tea.<br />One is "Jasmine Tea", the other "Jasmine Green Tea".  I suspect that THIS is the reason I so dislike the Jasmine Tea from Sunflower.  It is NOT "straight" Jasmine Tea...but MUST be Jasmine Green Tea.  And although Green Tea is said to have myriad health benefits, it sure doesn't make as tasty and satisfying a brew as Jasmine tea.  Even when, it seems, it is MIXED with Jasmine Tea.<br /><br />One would expect people in the People's Republic of China to know the difference!  And to label their tea accordingly!  Not everyone, (including me!) is a tea expert...and the difference between "Jasmine Tea" and "Jasmine Green Tea" should be noted on the tea-box label, for tea novices, such as I...as it is, thoughtfully, by Twinnings Teas.  I am, at present, extremely disappointed at the carelessness in labeling.<br />Those who want "Jasmine Tea" only will, I am sure, be likewise disappointed by this probably-mislabeled-by-mistake-or-by-carelessness "Jasmine Tea".  It is NOT "Jasmine Tea" to my palate -- it is, I am almost certain, "Jasmine Green Tea".  There is SUCH a difference in taste!!!!!!<br /><br />I know Green Tea is good for one, and so I will keep this tea.  I will combine it with the "ordinary" tea I find at the supermarket -- and which I find far more flavourful!  (NOTE: Second cup of tea -- even mixed with "ordinary" orange pekoe tea, (two tea-bags!), is not to my taste.  Therefore....as is listed in the "NOTE: PS",  below, I HAVE DECIDED I AM NOT KEEPING this tea, but am putting it up for sale, for those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, (obviously some people do, as reflected in the other, sterling reviews of this tea), and would like it -- 1 pound minus two servings -- at a bargain price.)<br /><br />However, this tea is certainly not to MY taste.  And so disappointed am I, that, unless there is a very, very great difference in price, I will stick to buying genuine,<br />"JASMINE Tea", from Twinnings, (who takes the time and trouble to carefully label each TYPE of Jasmine Tea), from now on -- even if Sunflower does decide to mend it's ways and re-label its tea!<br /><br />A great flavor disappointment -- due to careless labelling!<br /><br />.............................................................<br />.............................................................<br /><br />p.S.  NOTE:  Today, 12th March, 2009 -- two days after I have written this review -- and about 6 days after I have received this tea, I have FINALLY seen that, yes indeedy....the package DOES say, "Green Tea With Jasmine Flowers" -- on the BACK of the tin, in smallish lettering!  One cannot see the BACK of the tin from the Amazon.com illustration!  From the "Product Description", it states that "Jasmine Tea is one of the most pleasant-tasting green teas available...." -- but does NOT mention any differentiation between the two varieties: "Jasmine Tea", ane "Jasmine Green Tea" -- as Twinnings Teas thoughtfully does.  Even from the "Proudct Description", which probably has been supplied by Sunflower, a novice would STILL not know there are two distinct and different TYPES of Jasmine Tea!  AND THERE DEFINITELY ARE TWO VARIETIES: - I have been on the phone with my sister, and she concurs: she (also), LOVES plain Jasmine Tea, but detests Jasmine GREEN Tea.  But -- I suppopose there ARE those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, looking at the ohter sterling reviews of this same tea.<br /><br />I don't like it. But I'm glad that there are those who do like it.  I have had two cups of 5his tea -- and have revised my opinion about keeping it.  I am putting it up for sale, via my Amazon.com shop.  I may lose mnney in this transaction, but better that, (for me), than suffering through more of this Jasmine Green Tea.  Besides, there PROBABLY ARE others who like it.  I guess I'll not only be doing myself a favour -- but will also be doing my "good deed" for the day, by putting it up at a bargain price for those who truly enjoy Jasmine GREEN Tea!  If you want to buy it, it's here -- used only twice, at the aforesaid bargain price! (Hey, that rhymes!)<br /><br />Note to Sunflower Teas:  PLEASE LABEL YOUR TEAS MORE CAREFULLY FROM NOW ON!On July 25/10, we were in a Parlor Suite asleep in our room with the bedroom door closed. We had turned the lights out, and drew the shades closed in order to get black out conditions in our room. 8:30 a.m. someone turned the light switch on in our bedroom, causing my wife to stir. She yelled “what the hell”, expecting I was up and responsible for the lights, only to look over and see me sleeping beside her! Whoever they were saw both of us in bed, then proceeded to close the door and make their way out of our room with about $500.00 in cash. When we got up and went into the living room area, the thieve(s) were gone, but the adjoining room door was left open 2 feet. My wallet and wife’s Fendi glasses were moved up to the bar, and the cash was taken. They were obviously planning on coming into our bedroom and ensuite to clean up on any other jewelry and or monies. We phoned the front desk immediately and told them of our problem. They said they would send security right away. 10 minutes later I called the front desk again to say no one came. 10 more minutes passed by so I called them again. Then another 10 more minutes went by before I called them again. After 35 minutes, security finally showed up and said in a very uncaring and condescending tone “What’s Your Problem?” The security person named Bob was callous. My wife thought it must have been an inside job because of his delay in attending and indifferent demeanor with us. I told him don’t be so grumpy with us, at which point he settled down to have me start writing down the report. His excuse was that he was busy with other problems. So then what were the six security guards doing at the bottom of the elevator, in and around the private tower suites entrance? Sweet Nothing!! Lamar Odom, Kevin Durant, and other Team USA Basketball players were staying in these suites as well at the same time. Maybe some, all, or most of the suites were targeted. It’s apparent that the Wynn stood down while doing nothing about adding additional security. In the end, the Wynn Risk Management Department said it was our fault for leaving our front door ajar. The door handle lifts up to deadbolt, and opens again by pushing down. I know I didn’t lift the handle up to deadbolt it, but I’m sure it didn’t stay open on its own either. These doors usually slam by themselves. The door does not need to be dead bolted to be closed. If normally closed (but not dead bolted) you still need a key card to get in. When asked about security cameras in the hallways, they said they don’t have them and never would because of guest privacy. REALLY! What guest needs privacy in the hallway? This is a public corridor that needs to be monitored against all types of crime. Safe to say, this place has no security and I can never return again given this fact. The bottom line is, was it possible that we didn’t close the door properly, and some random door pusher entered our room, proceeded to rob us, then opened the adjoining room door, before finally leaving through the front door? Sure it’s possible, but if he ran out the front door, wouldn’t it be left ajar as well, as Risk Management told me I had done at 2:16 in the morning!......and……. If my door WAS ajar, security HAS the capability to see it and act on it. Security could then make one of two calls. Either call us to close our door, or call the thief to do his job! I have a relative that does security for one of the other 5 star hotels on the strip, and he said that his “Property Loss Reports” were constantly changed by his superiors to reflect a better (not responsible) management position. He laughed at us for expecting security, and also told us if we’re going to get our room broken into, it would be at a Hotel like the Wynn, and in one of the expensive suites, as that is where the money is. I would have written this review earlier, but I had to wait until now because I can’t post on the Wynn twice within a 3 month period. You see, we were here in April, and then again in July, so don’t expect your repeat visits to provide you with a better experience. And Lastly…. To Mr. Wynn…. Please take another look at the integrity of your security personnel, and or maids / minibar refillers. I believe the possibility exists that our deadbolt was intentionally left open on our adjoining room by someone who can rightfully gain entrance to our suite. I also believe it is possible that access was provided into our room through that unlocked adjoining room door. And I also believe that it is possible that security and/or the maids know of this and can take advantage of it. Bear in mind that this all conveniently took place on our last morning, allowing us very little time to react to this disturbing violation of privacy prior to our flight home.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.I recently stayed at the Town and Country Hotel for a conference, and I absolutely will never willingly set foot here again; in fact, I'm also recommending to my employer that we never schedule another seminar there. I hadn't read any reviews whatsoever about the place before heading there, so I didn't have any preconceived notions about what I would find, other than the pictures on the hotel's website. Needless to say, the hotel is completely unacceptable as a business destination. So, where to begin... * Accommodations The room we stayed in was in one of the hotel's two towers, known as the Regency. The hotel was decrepit. Everywhere you look, paint is scraped and chipped, lightbulbs are burnt out (and allowed to stay that way), windows have dirt in the corners, there are dings in the walls and door jambs, and other such problems. Our room itself has obviously not been updated since the late 80's, to include the comforter, which was faded and frayed. The bathroom is lit by two dim bulbs, which is fine, since brighter light would have drawn even more attention to the stained bathtub, yellowed and peeling grout, and rusty hinges on the door. The door itself looks like it has been repeatedly urinated on, as it is streaked yellow. The air conditioning in our room was so pitiful that we ran it non-stop from the time we arrived to the time we left, and it was never able to bring the room temp below 72º. It was also unable to remove the mugginess from the air. We slept with the window open the first night, but, sad to say, our room faced the San Diego Herald-Tribune loading docks, so at 3:30 AM we were assailed with the crash of tractor-trailers backing up to receive shipments of newspapers. The window stayed closed after that. The grounds were beautiful, with rose bushes everywhere, and arbors, trellises, and cute little architectural touches in abundance. Of course, many of those touches, such as ornamental scrollwork, were straight from Home Depot and simply glued in place and painted; they were often askew or chipped and peeling. It was the equivalent of adding as much garnish to a dinner plate as possible to try and hide the fact that the main course was only so much boiled shoe-leather. In addition to everything else, our toilet stopped flushing on the second day. After we called maintenance to fix it, it wouldn't stop flushing. It's feast or famine at the Town & Country. Speaking of famine... * Food Business travelers and convention-goers are usually on a time crunch, as they have only so much time to eat and then be back at the next session or class. The food service at the hotel was so slow that a number of us had to skip meals or eat cold cuts from the deli; when you have only an hour and it takes 40 minutes to get just your drinks, there is a problem. The food was also sub-par; the breakfast buffet at the Terrace Cafe is to be avoided at all costs. The food is cold, rubbery, and of a quality well below that of most fast-food places. The ribs at Kelly's Steakhouse were overdone and dried out, as was the BBQ chicken; the only thing worth eating was the appetizer. Charlie's Bar & Grill was agonizingly slow and overpriced; $13 hamburgers and expensive sodas can quickly eat up your per-diem allowance. * Connectivity As a business traveler, it is essential to stay connected to the office, and Internet access is a key part of that for anyone operating in the 21st century. Here, too, the Town and Country was a let-down. With no wired access, you are forced to purchase ($3 an hour or $10 for 24 hours) wi-fi access through a vendor called LodgeNet. However, the access was so spotty that I was unable to reliably check email, and had to spend over ninety minutes on the phone with LodgeNet tech support to even get connected. * Staff The front-office staff were professional to the point of being brusque, but I only had to deal with them rarely. The waitstaff at Kelly's were utterly clueless, even to the point of failing to unlock the front door on time (we had to go in through the lounge and then tell them that the door was still locked). The waitstaff at Charlie's were arrogant and ignorant of the needs of the customers. The only two places I found excellent staff were at the Trellises restaurant and the in the housekeeping staff. At Trellises, both Angelica and Jesus, and a third gentleman whose name I didn't catch, were charming and responsive, and the food was excellent. As for the housekeeping staff, they did an excellent job with what they had to work with, and our housekeeper took extra special care with my boys' stuffed animals and even hung our wet swimsuits back up after having cleaned the bathroom. * Conclusions Overall, the front-line staff are doing the best they can in the absence of involved and commited top management, which may either be uninterested or incapable of improving the place. The Town and Country has the feeling of a sinking cruise liner; the band is still playing, but the ship is getting lower and lower in the water, and it is only a matter of time before it slips beneath the waves. Unless it is saved by a rescuer with an infusion of cash and competence, the Town and Country does not have much longer to live. I have already sent a note to our central education office (of a government agency with 160,000 employees) asking them to avoid scheduling us at this hotel in the future.We were wondering why they were there to make our dining experience miserable?Decided in March 07 to visit Las Vegas for a one night stay in May 07 for business and pleasure. I booked two rooms at TheHotel at Mandalay Bay for $179 each. This rate was lower than other travel websites and lower than the hotel's direct website for the specific date I needed. In addition, this rate included: 4pm late checkout, two $20 breakfast certs per room, potential for an upgraded suite if available and a $100 spa credit for services for each room. WOW. When my associate and I arrived at TheHotel at 10 am, the bell desk took my two suitcases to a storage room. The front desk rep advised one room was available and he confirmed that I would have a 4pm late checkout. I was provided with the keys to my room, my associate was advised to call the front desk later in the day to see if his room was ready. I provided the front desk rep with my luggage tag and asked him to send the suitcases up to the room. We both went to my room for about fifteen minutes, we then decided to leave, even though the luggage had not arrived. I wrote out a large note to the bell desk employee and left the note along with a $5 tip on the table. In addition, I left my itinerary for the flight the next day, my dinner reservation confirmation sheet, breakfast certs, minibar key and some other paperwork on the side table next to the couch. My associate left his duffel bag containing his clothing in the room. I also placed several of my credit cards into his duffel bag. We left the room and returned at 3pm. When we arrived back in the room, my associates duffel bag was missing-including my credit cards, along with the $5, and all other paperwork. Furthermore, my two pieces of luggage were not in the room. I called the front desk immediately and was transferred to security. After a brief investigation (10 minutes) I was advised that the room was cleaned and that his duffel bag was in Lost and Found. I was obviously concerned that my credit cards were missing and asked for an explanation as to why the attendant had cleaned the room when it was clearly occupied and we had checked in. The response was, it "appeared to be an error." I asked that my luggage be delivered to the room along with my associate's duffel bag. I'd contacted a concierge service months prior to the trip to set up a special dinner reservation for 5pm that night. It was now 3:15 pm. At 4pm, I called the front desk again to find out why we had still not received my luggage, his duffel bag, replacement breakfast certs and his room key. At 4:15 pm, my luggage was delivered along with his duffel bag and his room key, but no breakfast certs. We were wearing resort attire and needed to change into business casual after showering, etc. It was obvious we weren't going to make dinner at 5pm since it was at least a 15 minute cab ride, not including the wait and we were still in shorts/tshirts. I called the concierge service and fortunately they were able to move the time back to 6pm. A bit of a hassle on my part stemming from TheHotel's error and very slow service. We went out to dinner, when we returned, I had to call the front desk again for the breakfast certs. The Breakfast the next morning was wonderful, two of the four certs were used and greatly appreciated. The next day, we both utilized the spa credits toward several services. My associate left TheHotel about noon to catch his flight. I called the front desk as a courtesy, since a large event was in town, to advise that his room was now vacant and to verify that I had a 4pm ck out. It was confirmed. I went out for a while and returned to my room at about 3pm to gather my luggage for my 440pm flight. My two keys did not work in my door. I was very concerned that I was going to have another bad experience at TheHotel and I was under time pressure since airlines advise arriving at the Las Vegas airport at least two hours prior to departure. I called the front desk from a hallway courtesy phone (I was on the 29th floor, a walk to the front desk would have consumed several minutes and when I walked through the lobby earlier, there were at least 25 people in line to check in). I was advised that even though I had a 4pm ckout, the computer system had automatically checked me out. I needed to wait for security to deliver me a new key. Based on my hour and fifteen minute wait yesterday, I was very upset and concerned that I was going to miss my flight (I'd booked a first class seat and didn't want to be assigned to coach-or lose my seat on this Memorial Day holiday weekend if I ck'd in late). Plus, I had other travel arrangements for the next day. I waited 15 minutes for security to arrive with a new key, a front desk staff member also arrived at my room. I expressed my concerns about my flight and the previous day's several incidents. They made no attempt to offer expedited transport to the airport and provided me with a basic apology for being locked out. I hustled to TheHotel taxi line-without stopping for a copy of my bill even though I need it for my tax records because the front desk line was again very long and I was in a rush; fortunately I made it to the airport on time. The room rate and package of benefits was really great; unfortunately, TheHotel's many service related issues created several stressful situations. Even though the I enjoy the décor of TheHotel, I won't return for quite some time since my overall impression is that they have many service glitches. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay, so we had a few problems ( bad ones ) and as a consequence we had to move rooms. No big deal, hey it happens, but the hotel won't move you, you have to physically move yourself - again no big deal but you have to do it by 6pm or they give your room away - not good as the room wasn't available every time we went back to get the new key. So finally we move into a new room - excellent you'd think. At 1.30am after we'd just got to sleep there's heavy knocking on the door. After travelling for 30 hours, followed by an awful first night in this hotel, followed with spending most of our first day's holiday waiting to change rooms this is not what we wanted. On answering the door, it's 2 ladies from house keeping looking at me puzzled then apologising and backing away. Very angry, we eventually get back off to sleep. At 3.30am there's a hammering on the door with a male voice shouting ' security - open the door'. What the hell is going on??? I open the door ajar ( it has a security latch on it) and security is demanding to see photo ID. Seriously - at 3.30am in the morning. I refused and asked him what on earth he thought he was doing and told him to stop shouting as just maybe, other guests in the room opposite, were still asleep. When he explained that our room was supposed to be empty and we explained that we'd been moved into it because of a room change he apologised and couldn't explain how it had happened, but the strange thing is, he knew my first name. I tried to sleep again but ended up going down to reception ( no one answers the room phones) . Now the lad at the desk knew nothing, and said the manager on duty was 'unavailable' to me. After demanding he get her on the phone, turns out she's on the other desk due to staff shortages. I go to see her and she couldn't explain how it had happened and apparently she'd asked him to go to the room after housekeeping had reported they couldn't get in. Nothing makes sense here - why were they trying to get into a freshly cleaned room? Why does it take 2 hours for security to come bang on the door. How did he know my name when he was expecting the room to be empty?? Why didn't i believe the other reviews on this place?? Why oh why?? This place sucks big time. We were offered $50 to spend in the hotel food places for 'compensation'. So bearing in mind they make a profit on the food, that $50 probably costs the hotel about $18. So our room was $300 bucks for the night (new year period was pricey) and you offer us $50. Where's the effort?? At least a box of chocolates or even some flowers would have shown thought. The rooms are tired. Bedding is worn, quilts and mattress smell of smoke, bathrooms dirty, wardrobe falling apart, sinks don't drain, showers are a joke - use the shower and flood the bathroom, no facilities in the room ( no coffee, not even a shower cap!) Hair on the floor.Toenails !! Eew! Phone cover missing so you don't know which button is front desk etc. Dust everywhere. Lights not working in the room. Air con surprisingly good. Ipod dock doesn't work on new ipods. Cigarette burns in the furniture. Big chunks out the tables - repaired by colouring them in with black marker pens. What?? Internet reallllllllly slow. Shuttle service less than useless ( although the driver is really nice) Staff couldn't care less. Resort fee a con - $25 a day for what? The swimming pool area shuts down out of season. We stayed in december/january and it was beautiful sunshine. They pipe pool music in the outside pool area which makes you think that you can use the loungers, just not swim in the pool. Why else would they pump music here which is different to the hotel music. Wrong!! Security actually came and moved us and others on - we demanded to speak to management who eventually relented and let us lounge on the loungers as long as we didn't make a mess - are you serious ?? have you even seen the state of the place?? A mess?? They have one pool area that is available to use during out of season subject to weather. It was open the one day, closed the next ( no staff apparently) open the next but no loungers and the kids in the pool complaining the water was freezing. Lifeguard was really nice and good with people's kids but couldn't do anything about the pool temp except apologize. We had the unpleasant experience of dealing with the assistant hotel manager called Liz. If you wander why some hotels respond to comments on trip advisor and either apologize or explain how things had gone wrong or even thank people for positive comments and you wander why some don't? Well the answer is - this hotel couldn't give a monkey's about you. They just don't care. The hotels that respond to trip advisor at least show they care what there clients think. I'm pretty easy to please, have realistic expectations, know things go wrong and I accept this. This hotel works on the basis, there will be another punter tomorrow so who cares about the one today. Bad news guys, word spreads!! trip advisor works !! you'll find out soon enough. Apparently you were pretty good a few years ago - but not know. The casino tables are too dark to use properly so we'd go up to the strip. Tip - just get a cab to the rear entrance of Planet Hollywood and walk up through the Casino onto the strip. With a tip for the cab driver, it will be no more than $10 each way ( actual fare usually was $6.70-$7.10 )Planet Hollywood is much nicer, the Wynn is awesome, the Bellagio is looking a tiny bit tired inside but the staff are great. The Hard Rock - avoid!! Stay somewhere else. You have been warned.Beautiful Beach, Terrible Service My boyfriend and I just returned from a trip to the Melia Caribe Tropical from 6/28-7/4. The first day was a nightmare. We were originally supposed to arrive at the hotel around noon, however, our original flight was canceled and half our luggage was lost, etc., so we didn't get to the resort until 8 p.m. Of course this was not the resort's fault, but you can imagine all we wanted to do was check-in, shower and eat dinner. Because we were supposed to be there at noon and it was now 8 p.m., we figured our room was definitely ready for us.The check-in line only had two people in front of us, but it took forever. Finally, after checking in, we were given our keys, towel passes, a remote control? (why don't they just leave those in the room) and a safe key. The lady said to take our luggage to the porters and do not be alarmed if they don't deliver them immediately, they will eventually arrive. This made me a little skeptical, as the airline had already lost some of our luggage. She did not give us clear instructions on how to find the rooms, but at least she spoke English. We made our way to the porters and none of them spoke any English, which made things difficult. As we were trying to tell them what room we were in, the check-in lady comes running over and explains that the previous people had just checked out of our room and that it needed to be cleaned. She asked us to wait 10 minutes.We sat in the lobby and waited for about 20 minutes. I finally went back to the counter and explained to another desk person that we wanted a room. He went into a back room and appeared about 5 minutes later with a new room number. We made our way back to the porters to give them the new room number. Then two porters started speaking to each other and although I don't speak Spanish, I gathered from the pointing that the other group of people standing next to us had just given them the same room number! So the porter goes and gets the check-in person. Once again, we were told to wait. The check-in person went back into the back room. I was not happy at that point.Finally, 10 minutes later, they come back with a third room number. We gave the porters this new room number and aimlessly started looking for our room because they did not give us clear directions. We finally find our room, enter the key card, and it doesn't work and we can hear that people are in the room. I was furious. My boyfriend and I agreed that he should stay there in case they brought our luggage while I went back to the lobby to get a fourth room!When I got back to the lobby and explained that this was the fourth time and this was ridiculous, the desk person made it seem like I was upset for no reason. He said I was on vacation and should enjoy myself! I wanted to scream that maybe I could be enjoying myself if we could get a room. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that the manager knew of the situation. The desk person asked where my husband was. I told him that I left him at the room in case our luggage was delivered. The manager finally comes out and briefly apologizes. He asked me to wait three minutes. (Note: 1 Dominican Republic minute equals about 15 minutes). I asked if I should go get my husband because he was waiting for me at the other room. They said to leave him there while they got us another room. After way more than 3 minutes, they come back with a fourth room, said they ensured it was ready, and said a porter would take me to it. There was more confusion with where they sent my boyfriend and our luggage that I won't go into detail about, but you get the picture.The cleaning person was still cleaning the room when we got there. There was no comforter or towels and he said he'd be back in 5 minutes and never returned. The air conditioning also was not working. We called about the A/C, towels and comforter four different times. After about an hour, we got the towels and nothing else. We showered and went to the Mexican buffet for dinner at almost 11 p.m. When we got there, we were ignored and not seated, even though there were plenty of waiters standing around doing nothing. Every time we asked to be seated, no one spoke English. The food was mediocre. When we returned to our room over an hour later, the A/C still had not been fixed.When we went to make dinner reservations the next day, we were told everything was booked except two nights and one of the nights was at 9:45 p.m. The other available spot was for the Italian restaurant that was previously a buffet, which we had already eaten at, but we took it anyway. Oddly, even though everything was supposedly booked, both restaurants were not even half full the whole time we ate there. The food was good, not great. The service was horrible. We were not approached by a waiter until about 15 minutes after being seated. It took them forever to get our drink orders, napkins (none were on our table), etc. Most people barely spoke any English.Luckily, the beach was beautiful. The water is crystal clear. One of the days, there was a school of fish swimming around us and we could see them perfectly. The sand is very white. The landscaping on the resort is impeccable. They were constantly mowing, trimming, etc. the whole time we were there.Here's a tip: Bring your own towels. Every day we went to get towels, they were out. They would tell us to come back in half an hour, but they never had towels. We spent a whole day going back and forth and never got towels.Another tip: Avoid buying anything in the gift shops at the resort. A disposable camera and a bag of chips was $26. Two small bottled waters and Immodium was $17. Batteries and a bottle of aloe vera was $12.I was disappointed with the resort, but I will say the beautiful beach and great weather we had at least made up for some of it.I wish I had read more hotel reviews before booking this hotel! I don't consider myself to be a picky traveler and I consider the hotel, just a place to stay when you are not out having fun. I tried to ignore the short falls of the hotel but in the end there were just way too many!! We arrived late at night on Feb. 20th. They put us in a corner room in building five and everything seemed great. As we start unpacking (11:30 pm) we notice that we are in a 3 bedroom 2 bath instead of a 3 bedroom, 3 bath. We called downstairs to find out what was going on and then found out that they had no 3 bedroom 3 baths open, and that we would have to wait until the next day after checkout (9am - 11am) to move. I couldn't believe they wouldn't have told us that at the desk when we checked in???!!!! They just put us in the wrong room and acted like nothing was wrong. So the next morning we had to then repack everything and delay our kids from going to Disney. We hung out in the lobby for an hour waiting for word on our room. Finally at 11 they told us to go to Disney and that they would move our belongings to our new room and everything would be ready when we came back. Lie #2 Nothing had been done when we returned back to the hotel. We had to move all of our things to tower one, a dirty room overlooking the parking lot of the Factory outlet. Lie #3 They then told us how sorry they were and that they would comp our room the first night. (Read Below - this was another lie) Lie#3 My husband was in Orlando on business and had to have the internet. He called the hotel ahead of time to make sure they had wifi. Needless to say, we were never able to get any internet connection in our room. He went out and purchased a cable and we were still never able to get any access. The hotel then lied again to say usually they do have access but it was down. When we finally moved into our room in tower one at 9:30 pm my young kids were worn out and ready for bed. We went to make up the couch bed only to find the sheets were the wrong size. We called to get sheets and they told us they would be right up(Lie #4). 35 minutes later still no sheets. I had to get dressed and go down to the lobby to get them to send sheets up to our room. We wore flip flops in our room because it was so dirty. We stopped using the kitchen because there were small spider looking bugs everywhere. We didn't notice them at first, but they got into our cereal boxes. So we threw everything away and ate at Dunkin Donuts for breakfast and the Irish pub for dinner. The burger there was delicious! We spent no time out on our balcony because it overlooked a parking lot - very disappointing. The kids did enjoy getting in the tubs in the bathroom every night and relaxing after a long day in the parks. My kids complained a few times that they had bites behind their knees and underarms. I ignored it thinking maybe mosquitoes. After reading reviews since I returned from my trip I see many people have complained about bed bugs. I am wincing in disgust hoping that I did not bring any home with me. If I did there will be a major PROBLEM! The swimming pool was great. The kids loved the slide and the hot tubs were very relaxing. The life guard had to leave the slide closed several times to constantly get more towels, that was kind a bummer for my boys. Also, plan well, because as the sun goes down the pool is shaded and cold. They told us they were not going to charge us for the first night. At checkout they then told my husband they were not going to charge us for two nights because of the problems with the room and internet. Upon getting our bill we noticed that they only discounted our bill for the resort fee for two nights - that's 20 dollars. Careful with the taxi drivers at the hotel they wanted to charge us 30 dollars to bring us to the parks and 65 to the airport. Sadly we paid that not knowing we could get it a lot cheaper. Shame on them for taking advantage and shame on the hotel for letting them. We rented a van so my husband could get back and forth to his class. Parking was very limited and sometimes you just had to park on the road or park far away from your tower. In conclusion ( after reading reviews about this hotel for the last year) it seems like the hotel is going downhill rapidly!!! There may still be some good rooms left in the newer towers. If you are staying here you may want to contact those people who wrote good reviews and ask what their room number was. I was in building one on the 7th floor - I would stay away from this whole tower! Good Luck If my bill is not resolved I am considering reporting this hotel to the better business bureau. I am definitely following up on the bed bug investigation someone mentioned in their post.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.I had to flag down a third staff person for a fork... so now it's goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company.My only complaint might be the fortune cookies - I've never had a cookie predict bad luck for me before I visited Kar.Let me just start by saying this trip was supposed to be one to celebrate my husbands birthday (last year he was serving in Iraq for his birthday), a getaway to make up for the honeymoon we never got and a time to meet up with my extended family (including my brother who left to deploy the day after we got back). We were very much looking forward to this trip. We were staying in a two bedroom with a pullout couch with a total of three couples arriving at three different times. Arrangements had been made by my cousin (the timeshare holder) for this resort to be in my name so we could check in a day earlier than she and her spouse. Upon arrival, the hotel could not find our reservation. It took them 30 mins and lots of us and them calling around to find it. Once they finally did we were let into our room. After running around and finally getting settled in my husband and I decided to sit down and have a nice quiet night and watch a movie. We first noticed buttons were missing off the actual tv but didn't think much of it. But then when I went to pick up the remote, the batteries flew across the room because there was no back on it! I decided it wasn't that big of a deal and went on. We then proceeded to try to watch a movie only to find the dvd player was broken and making a huge loud popping noise. We called the front desk and they sent someone up. It took him running back and forth to find a new dvd player and an hour to hook it up. The next morning my husband opened the dresser to put our clothes away only to have our dresser fall apart! We again called front desk and they sent maint again. After trying for a while to fix it then leaving and coming back he decided he couldn't fix it and had to find another one. The first morning after my cousin arrived, she woke to roll over and find a pair of mens underwear that did not belong to anyone in our party! We immediately called the housekeeping to notify of her findings only to have them tell her they must belong to her husband! She then hung up and called the front desk to complain of all the issues building up and also to let them know of the panels that are coming off the wall near the balcony of our wonderful view of the parking lot. They said it being memorial day weekend they could only move us to another room and have no other sister hotels to send us to or rooms to upgrade us to. We had to then pack up all of our belongings and groceries we had bought for a week and move everything to a completely different building. The hotel did not even offer to help! They only thing they could do to make up for it was a dinner off site (we refused to eat at their horrible restaurant). Which when it came time for us to get our vouchers and go to dinner they were not at the front desk. So they had to track down the GM to get them. All the while we missed the shuttle and had to pay for a taxi! We also had her comp us a few drinks at the pool but she was not happy about having to do both. Our room had two bathrooms, so one bathroom was shared by four people. Knowing this, housekeeping still only gave us enough towels for two people. The bedrooms do not have any fans and the air barely worked in our room so my husband and I sweat it out every night. We had the ac on the lowest it would go but still nothing! After sleeping in our new bed my husband and I both noticed we were itchy. We didn't think much of it until after the next night when we were both bright red and covered in hives. We had welts all over our bodies that itched like crazy! I called to the front desk and they said we must just be allergic to their detergant and that it wouldn't help to get new sheets. It did not seem very likely to us that we were both allergic to the same detergant and that we were fine in the first room but not his one! I told her to send the sheets anyways. When we got home we noticed they brought new sheets but rather than put them on they just left them on the table near the door! After we put the new sheets on the day we left we finally started to get better. The shuttle was nice to have but only runs until midnight. So you do not get a ride home if you plan on going home late. All the drivers had different rules and if there were a lot of people waiting you had to wait for the next time which could be an hour. A taxi back to the hotel is a minimum of $20 but will often run you double that with the traffic. We had to use the taxi more often then planned because they had one shuttle broke down so rather than the 15 min wait time they advertise, you wait more like 30. I will say that they nicest people we came across were two of the shuttle drivers. The restaurant at the pool is awful. They are incredibly overpriced. The chicken wings were very over priced and I must say the worst I've ever had. The frozen margaritas out of the machine were great though. But did cost you $12. The pool is large and has water slides but it got extremely crowded on the weekend. There were not enough chairs for people, but plenty of room where they could have bought them. I guess the hotel was too cheap for that. We had six people in our room but were only allowed to check out one pool float per room! They had a cookout for the weekend that we decided to purchse food from. We went to the food only to find you must go to the restaurant on the other side of the pool area to stand in line to purchase tickets then come back to the food to stand in line to get your food! We did this and when it was our turn to get our food they ran out!! They were not sure if they would get anymore, but finally came up with some 30 minutes later. The only reason we were able to get food was because we happened to walk up and check to see if any was there right before it had once again run out. The organization and planning of this hotel is a disgrace. After staying at this hotel I will NEVER purchase a timeshare. I will NEVER EVER recommend this hotel to ANYONE! This is the worst hotel on the market. I am highly disappointed. Especially after reading so many great reviews. I could go on and on about how much this hotel ruined our trip but I will stop. I think you get the point. It was awful and completely ruined our trip. Oh and my husband and I just finally got our hives, redness and severe itching to go away today...one week after being home! DO NOT stay here!!!!!Meal was very expensive for what you get.I Meant to write this a lot earlier to warn people about this hotel, but have had to deal with damage from Hurricanes Ramada Inn Eastside- New York, New York 161 Lexington Avenue New York City, NY 10016 We have traveled extensively all over the world for over 30 years and stayed in a range of lodging ranging from super luxurious six stars to rooms with dirt floors that you had to lock the doors to keep the goats out. When you go to Manhattan and pay those prices you expect a certain level of accommodation. Not a hotel better suited for some third world country. My apology for any third world county who has such a hotel. Ramada Inn - New York, New York is dirty, small and had an odor problem. As soon as you entered the hotel you are hit by wall of smell somewhere between musty and old gym locker. Our family stayed in this hotel for six days. We would have moved out within 30 minutes if could have found another room. For some reason most of surrounding hotels were booked. The lobby was small and dirty with furnishing showing their age. There were two small elevators so we had to split into two groups. My daughter got stuck between floors for almost an hour. This elevator continued to do this the entire time we were there so we avoid it. The other elevator was soooo slow. It was much faster to walk. Not sure they ever fixed it. Even now there may be some poor guest trapped. The hallway to our room had musty smell of mold. Although we had requested a non-smoking room our room had the odor of stale cigarettes and half cleaned ashtrays littered the room. I wonâ€™t tell you how the bathroom smelled. The seat to the toilet was broken and if you did not sit just right you would slide right off the toilet onto the floor. Despite numerous requests over six days nothing was done. Bath tub was filthy (could tell by the pubic hair the previous occupant was a red head) and the drain control had a jagged piece of metal sticking out is side. The grout between the tiles had a nice coating of slimy blackish mildew. This is the only time I can remember on vacation going out to corner market and buying a bottle of bleach and scrubbing pad to clean the bathroom so we could use it. Very low water pressure and at best it was luke-warm. Tried to adjust the temperature and the faucet knob literally came off in my hand. Found major dust bunnies and debris of previous occupants in the space between the bed and the wall. There was no tv remote in the room. Called the front desk and got nothing but promises. Had to wait until the occupants of a nearby room checked out and why the made cleaned that room got their TV remote. When we checked into the room the lightbulb to the reading lamp was burned out, called down to request it be replace. Said it would be. After several days and several requests and no action we went out and bought our own lightbulb. The bedspreads on the beds were in terrible condition with a number of holes you could one or more fingers through. Then we get to the really fun part- meeting the roomâ€™s wildlife. On our first night after checking in going out to dinner and getting ready for bed, we pull back the bedspread and blanket and watch a number of black dots scurry across the sheets- LARGE fat bedbugs. I even managed to capture one in an empty pill bottle. Took a picture of it for proof and I will post in the picture. I immediately called the front desk and they said they would take care of it. How they took care of it was to ignore the problem and continue to use the same sheets. The reason I know this is there was a stain on one of the sheets and it was the same sheet night after night. It not a very pleasant thing to have to strip off the sheets from your bed, take them out into the hallway and shake them vigorously to get rid of any wildlife. Were talking doing this for five nights in a row. Despite this the sheets felt itchy. Then we had the world famous game called â€œChase the cockroaches up the walls as you take a showerâ€� Donâ€™t get too close or they might jump on you. New York Roaches are well known for being aggressive and nasty. See a race in progress in my pictures I have posted about this hotel Meeting the hotelâ€™s wildlife continued at it Complimentary Continental Breakfast. Bagels were stale, juice had an off taste, fresh fruit had some pieces beginning to rot, flies and nats buzzing around food. Got a great picture of one when he landed on our table. I think he is smiling. What do you think? See picture I have posted. The bananas were in such bad condition they should have been buried rather then served to human beings. All it took was one exposure and a resulting queasy stomach and during the rest of our stay we ate breakfast elsewhere. Among the Amenities offered were Computers with Internet access. Which was very true if you can find one that works or you can try and use a keyboard with most of the letters and number worn off. What the hotel does not tell you is that they do not provide printers. I found this out when I was in the process of trying to check in for my flight and wanted to print my boarding pass. I was informed at the front desk I would have to use the next door cybercafe. This meant you would have to pay by the minute to use the internet. I found out later from front desk that this was owned by the hotel. Nice way to earn a few extra buck from something that was suppose to be a free Amenities. Then we come to the management and staff of the hotel. By their actions and response to questions asked and various requests by guests, they seemed to look at us guests as some sort of ill smelling bottom feeding scum sucking creatures and they were deities who like Job in the bible was cursed with the affliction of having to put up with them. Not only were they not responsive or helpful, they were ant-responsive and anti-helpful going out of their way to make the guest feel small when they dared disturbed important activities of reading a newspaper, talking to their girlfriends on the phone or just staring out the window. While the price may seem right, the experience is not worth it. There are a lot better hotels than this in the area for about the same money. NYC is a fantastic place. Why ruin your visit by staying here. Good Luck, See The World and Stay SafeAt peak times, the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close.First I must express my disappointment with my Travel Agent for recommending me to this place...I stayed at The Embassey Suites from May 18th to May 20th 2007 and from the moment I check in me first impression of the place was that it was worn and in need of a face lift. Upon checkin I was greeted by a very unfriendly agent who appeared to be very tired and just wanted for this to be her last duty for the day. She asked to see my credit card which was on file, I told her that I wished not for my credit card to be charged and opted to pay cash in full with an additional security deposit she told me that it was not neccessary given that me credit card would not be charge and I can settle at the end of the two day stay. Little and behold on the second night I was complete humilated and embrassed given that Security had locked me out of my room. I went to the Front Desk spoke with a so call Manager named "Karyn" who appeared to be clueless as to what had occurred and expressed to interest in my concern. I again asked her what was the problem given that I was locked out she indicated that they were charging me credit card two hundred dollars a day security..I immediate informed her told her of what her agent said to me upon checkin and paid my bill in full. I told her that I would like to have her General Manager "Juan Carlos Palacious returned a call to me to express my total disatifaction and she said that he cannot be reach she had no contact information at her property for him. I became furious I demanded that he return a call and went to my room escorted by security to open my room door. Karyn left work at 11:36pm on May 19th 2007 and never returned a follow up call. No word from Mr. Palicious as well. Upon entering my room I freaked to find out that not only was the door locked but the room was not clean at 12 midnight. I went back to the Front desk and spoke with Marcos who confirmed that Karyn left and he was the only person on property that I can speak with and we was only an agent..You can imagine what was going through my mind during this time, I ask Marcos to contact his Manager or some senior person and he told me that no one was reachable. I asked Marcos if this was indeed an emergency with a Guest at his hotel what is the process he told be that he would call the revelant athorities and write a report and update his GM when he sees him. I could not believe what I was hearing and became fearful knowing that his hotel did not have a senior person availble to assist guest conerns. I noted the many definciencies with room 7-314 room very moldly, room leaking near the sliding door I jumped out of bed into a pool of water, faucet is leaking in the bathroom, shower is broken, no day service, TV had a black screen unable to view. tile cracked in the bathroom, the furnitures are worn and old, and the staff need a completed training course in customer service and how to handle complains they were completely unresonsive and refuse to take responsiblity for their own ineptidue. This place is a complete waste of money particually when you are paying almost $200.00 a night not worth it at all...The first room that I was assigned was 7-432 which was completely unbearable from the moment you entered the room mold everywhere..I opted to eat breakfast outside of the hotel given that I was concern about the cleaniness of this Hotel. Please note that I tried calling your 800 number to get some help and spoke with Erin in resevation who said that there was nothing she can do and question me as to why Marcos told be to call the 800 number. I asked her for her last name and she said no. I was so furious at this hotel and in total disbelief that there was no Customer Service of any kind anywhere at the Embassy Suites (MIA). I told Marcos that iI wanted a Manager to call me at first light in the morning to speak with them prior to departure and again up to 11am on May 20th 2007 no response from no one...unbeliveable. I then motion to the Front desk and spoke with the Security Manager who said that he was the Manager on duty and I told him my concerns...and asked to speak with the GM he told me that he was not available. I reinterate my conerns and asked him what the [--] is going on in this place with only one Security Officer on duty at the front gate and no other management presence anywhere..he said that he was the way they do things there..I pulled out my business card and told him that I was a Hotel Manager at a world class hotel and told him that if my guest needed assistance with a concern that warrants my attention my staff can reach me without a doubt. When he saw my card he started to act nice.. I also told him that if I needed to reach my chaiman I can reach him without a doubt. i told him that my number one Core value is to "Blow away the Customer" and my staff is impowered to make it happen. My Guest is of utmost importance to me and to have any of my Guest leave unhappy is a major problem. I told him, my staff are impowered to resolve issuses. I suggested that they train these people in customer handling to appreaciate the value of a guest particually when there are other options..I requested the GM information and was given one night credit which was totally unaccepatable and not the response I was looking for. So all of you who are looking for a Hotel close to the Airport think twice about this place and also the security of yourselves. Today I tried calling the GM and again no response....I can also suggest that you hire JDPowers and associates to check your standards if any. I will never take my travel agent advice again..The 2 good things I found at this hotel: 1) LOCATION - You can walk to Universal City Walk within a few minutes. 2) Palm Restaurant is pretty good. Now the bad things I found: Arrival/Check-in Upon my arrival, it was rainy and I saw a sign to self-park. I followed the sign and parked the car expecting that I would enter the lobby level or at least a level with elevators or a covered walkway to the lobby. To my surprise, there is no elevators and I had to drag my 2 pieces of luggage across the parking lot in the rain and up 3 levels of wet stairs. When I checked in, they gave me 2 keys and 1 of the keys didn't work and checked me in a double-queen room when I asked for a King bed room. I went back to the front desk and told them that I requested for a King bed and the lady at the counter told me that my request was noted but it would not be guaranteed that I would get a King bed. They didn't tell me that when I booked the room. Some hotels charge a higher rate for a King bed than a Queen or Double Queen. It was a good thing that I traveled by myself and it was not a big deal. When we travel as a family, my 2 young kids like to sleep in with us (which may or may not be the best idea) but that what they like to do especially on a trip. I would have been really upset if I were to travel with my family. I later found out from another supervisor that they only have 4 King bed rooms in the entire hotel (that what he told me when he came to my rooms to discuss some other issues which I will share shortly below). Cleanliness (or should I say "DIRTINESS?") / Services/Conveniences DIRTINESS: After checking in, the first thing I noticed was a small bathtub with a filthy shower-head (the chrome shower-head is now in black color). I lifted up the sheets and there were some small black particles and even hairs! INCONVENIENCE - POOR DESIGN FOR BASIC THINGS This was a business trip and I had my work cell, personal cell and a laptop. I tried to look for place to charge all of these and another surprise, there is no outlet/place to plug in any thing around the nightstand between the 2 queen beds. Even their own alarm clock and lamp are plugged into the wall outlets behind the headboards that are not accessible. There is one duplex outlet on one wall of one bed and there is none for the other bed. I had to unplug the lamp to plug in one of my cell phones and the laptop and had to plug in the other cellphone on another wall that is not reachable from the bed (which means that if I either get a call from my personal phone or a work phone early in the morning, I would have to get out of bed to get to the phone or if you travel as a family and have other gadgets that you need to charge, you have to unplug some items to get other items charged). I have stayed at other much cheaper hotels where the electrical outlets are either on the lamps themselves or at a very convenience location. THEY TOOK SOME OF MY ITEMS THAT I COLLECTED FROM MY ROOM After going back from a trade show and stood in some long lines to get some freebies for my kids, I took them back to the hotel and left on the table. The next day I came back, I noticed that some items were missing. I picked up the phone to call their 'Star Service' number and there was no dial tone on the wireless handset. I walked to the wired desk phone and some of the buttons were sticky and worn out. I reported that some of my stuffs have been taken from my room and I gave them the benefit of the doubts that they might have mistakenly removed them and didn't report to security when the supervisor offered for me to do so. The house keeping manager called and left me a message a few hours later. The next day one of the front line manager called back and tried to address the issue. After all the issues that I reported, the only thing she offered to me was to find some replacement for the missing items (that would not be the same as what I collected). At least any other hotel or any service oriented managers would at least offer some incentives (such as discounted rate, complementary meal or some thing to keep the customers happy without the customers asking for it). They have no idea how to provide customer service. BACK TO DIRTINESS: On Thursday night, I took a shower and was about to use one of their bathrobes for the first time during my stay, I took the bathrobe out of the closet and there are few piece of rices on the bathrobe!!!! That means that never wash the bathrobes and put in the closet for new guests. How disgusting is that? I started to wonder whether they wash the towers or not. It's probably not a good idea to use bathrobes at any hotel from now on. I was too tired to deal with it and called the front desk the next morning and spoke to another manager. I asked him to come to my room to show him the DIRTY bathrobes and the chrome shower-head that had turned into a black shower-head. He found them to be disgusting himself but didn't really offer much until I asked for some incentives or discount. He offered future discount if I would bring my family back there in the future! I was thinking to myself, 'are you kidding me, you think I am going to come back after this experience?' I pushed the issue and he finally discounted the last day. Overall Overpriced, DIRTY and poor service. This is my worse hotel experience and I will never stay there again. Expect to pay $15/day for self-parking and ~ $25/day for valet (that is without tips). You don't even get wireless or internet access for free for a really expensive price already. I have not written any review before but I found that I have to write this review to share with people who may consider staying there.Initially this was a three page review. My wife told me I should whittle it down because no one will care about the details. So here it is. 2007 Princess Royale - Class 101 . . . We made reservations for an ocean front, non-smoking, single king size with a pull-out couch, and a balcony. We also made it very clear it would be a late check-in.). It was at this point things started to go wrong. The reservation “specialist” cut her off and said “Oh yes, there will be someone here to check you in.” Well that was not the point, but apparently the point was lost on the reservation “specialist”. After a couple hours drive we arrived and as always, in the summer, the valet staff is mainly comprised eastern Europeans, and new for this year, kids from the Middle East which is great because it gives me a chance to talk to kids from across the pond which I always enjoy. However, waiting ten minutes for a valet to even acknowledge us was, to put it mildly, frustrating. Finally we got a valet, and after some finagling we got a bellman as well. While I supervised the unloading of the luggage my wife went to check in. Arriving at the front desk I find my wife trying to explain to the attendant that we had reserved a non-smoking room. He, however, is in the process of telling her the only room available is a smoking room on a smoking floor and that “reservations” are not guaranteed. That’s when I broke in. “Excuse me but you are you telling me reservations are not guaranteed?” He quickly corrected himself and said “Room Requests are not guaranteed”. Being baffled, I asked him what “a room request” actually was. Suddenly the desk clerk educated me on Princess Royale policy and I was told requesting a certain size bed (as in a king size), ocean front/ocean view, or smoking or non-smoking counted as a “simple request” and not a reservation. So there we are . . . begging the desk attending to fill our reservation. The desk manager came out and offered to help the attendant find us a non-smoking room. Oh, and if there is a corporate officer from the Princess Royale reading this, do everyone a favor and make sure your desk manager speaks fluent English okay thanks. It was at this point the manager told us again the only room they had was on a smoking floor, but that it was okay because it wouldn’t smell like smoke. They offered to give my wife a key to go “check out” the room. She took them up on that offer and came right back down stairs saying the whole floor was thick with smoke. This went on for at least a half hour, all the while the other attendants are checking people in and I am thinking . . .why don’t you tell them their reservation is not guaranteed and give us their room and let them deal with this crap. Finally they found us a king size bed in a non-smoking room. Unfortunately it was a pool view. “Fine” we said, “We’ll take it”. I didn’t realize haggling was part of the reservation process in Ocean City but apparently it is at the Princess Royale. We got our keys and headed upstairs. Upon arriving at our hole in the wall we found the room they stuck us in was at one corner of the pool with no balcony. We took the room because it was all they would give us so we went off to the elevators. Elevators at the Princess Royale are a big deal because they only have two for each side of the hotel and it takes forever to get one and once you do it is almost guaranteed to stop on every single floor on the way down. Not only that but the house keeping crew uses the same elevators as the guests so you’ll have to be prepared to move over when the cleaning crew gets on. Not a big deal but defiantly annoyance. Now on to the room, did I mention the lack of balcony? After taking the room we decided we wanted to switch hotels (go figure) and started looking through the phonebook and hitting the net to find one which was more family friendly (more on the family friendly aspect later). As I was on the phone my wife informed me that if we checked out at this point (fifteen minutes into the stay) they were going to charge us for the entire time we had reserved (sorry requested) anyway. Well crap, I guess we are stuck, so we tried to make ourselves at home. At about 10:30pm the phone rings. It’s a Princess Royale quality assurance person calling to make sure everything is all right. My wife took the call because I am sure she didn’t want me picking up that phone. She told her that everything was not fine and that we had major issues. The quality assurance person said in her best Russian accent “Oh.” After a few more “oh’s” the line went dead and we never head from the quality assurance people again. Off to the bathroom, ant infestation anyone? Mold by the toilet anyone? Cleaning crew staging in the hallway screaming at each other at 6:00am in the morning? Up until this point I have been giving you first hand information. Now let me relay some of the other things I heard while talking to others who were staying there at the same time. Smoke detectors going off in rooms multiple times in a single night. Water main breaks which flooded the seafood buffet and people not being refunded their money, and no air conditioning in several rooms. In the end I have to say, I do have some fond memories of the Princess Royale, but I will never ever EVER again stay there again. Finally, I will never recommend it to any of my coworkers, friends, or family. If you choose to stay there remember the Latin axiom . . . Caveat Emptor.We stayed at the Crowne Plaza in San Diego's Mission Valley on Sunday, Aug. 31, 2008 and we will NEVER stay there again! Unlike some of the other reviewers, I felt the rooms were well-decorated - our room had framed floral prints on the walls - the bed was new and the linens were expensive. The carpet had a brown and gold checkered pattern and was new-ish and clean - and, yes, we checked to make CERTAIN the floors/carpets were clean after reading the other reviews. Even more important, the bathrooms were clean as well. There was no mildew in the bath/shower and the shower curtain hangs on a convex rod that keeps it from touching you during a shower. Fine. The vanity and floors were of the same matching tile - heavy, modern stuff. The vanity had two sinks - always a plus for my partner and me - it makes getting out in the mornings much more efficient. The free shower soaps and shampoos were of high quality and the towels were plush enough. The room (Room 1337 BTW) seemed to be recently renovated or was simply well-maintained. Not at all unpleasant. All of the above goes in the "plus" category. However, in the "minus" category: The hotel tries for a faux tropical feel (read: Hawaiian tat) but it is a very sad attempt at a theme that simply does not work. It is filled with poorly done (very perfunctory) water features - tacky, tacky, tacky - and the odd, sad, faded, captive coi that seemed to call out, "Save me, kind sir, for God's sake end my misery." Ugh! One of the elevators was out. Really? On a holiday weekend? The real negative stuff started when we found that the hotel is built on large eight-story high horseshoe shaped courtyard. Not good! Every door that closed - no I got that wrong - EVERY DOOR THAT WAS SLAMMED SHUT and slammed shut EVERY TIME the doors were closed reverberated in our room like a cannon being fired. It was astounding the amount of noise that was generated and the number of booms we heard from these slamming doors - there were hundreds of them! HUNDREDS! Especially on Sunday morning! Yes, many other reviewers mention this fact - but take my word for this - I have NEVER experienced such a cacophony - I kept shouting, "Incoming! and "Take Cover!" Wow! We went to San Diego because we have a season subscription at LaJolla Playhouse. We go to get away from the noise and pace of Los Angeles - not to attempt to relax in the middle of a reenactment of the Civil War. When we went out on the balcony and saw the state of the facilities and were not pleased at all. We were on the third floor overlooking the swimming pool. On either side of our balcony was the top of some sort of supporting structure or perhaps storage units. No matter, they are covered with ugly broken wooden lattices - they must have been new at some point - perhaps back in the early 1990s - now they are broken and junky and should be scrapped. There is trash and TOWELS that have been dropped from the floors above collected in these lattices and it is simply a mess. Ugh - again! It appears that the Management at the Crowne Plaza does only what is required and does not choose to go that little extra distance or put in that little extra effort to make a guest's stay NICE. Isn't NICE the goal? Well it oughta be! It doesn't have to be perfect - just NICE! Now on to the worst aspect of the place. The smoking! We cannot abide smoky hotel rooms and will move to another hotel instead of staying in a room that has been infused with cigarette smoke. One reason we chose the Crowne Plaza was that the entire wing we were in was SUPPOSED to be non-smoking. THAT IS A LAUGH! When we entered the room, I remarked that the place smelled like a hotel room - fresh linen - recently cleaned - you know, like a non-smoking hotel room usually smells - no smoke at all. So far so good. We WERE a bit put off by the "survival kit" that was on the bed when we entered though. Other reviewers have mentioned this "kit" but I will reiterate - it contains three very tell-tale objects. Ear-plugs - oh no! - a sleep mask to cover your eyes - say it ain't so! - and finally a tiny spray bottle of lilac linen freshener - huh? Well, I suppose that the first two items are self-explanatory - too much noise (see the report from the front-lines above) and too much light - although I did not find there was too much light in the room - and there was a drape clip attached to the drape pull that made keeping the light out a snap. (Perhaps this is for people whose closet lights will not go off - as mentioned in other reviews.) But as for the third item (the spray) it was not until late at night that we finally got it. Right in the kisser! Yes, our wing was non-smoking - the floors above us and below were non-smoking - but somebody, somewhere was smoking in that hotel - SEVERAL SOMBODIES IN FACT! Our room filled with noxious cigarette smoke at regular intervals ALL NIGHT LONG and it worsened in the morning when all those smokers somewhere in the Crowne Plaza (AND MY PARTNER AND I) - EVEN THOUGH WE *DON'T* SMOKE!!! - partook of that first cigarette of the day! Jeez! We needed gas masks (to maintain up the battlefield motif of this review.) Why claim non-smoking rooms at all when it is obvious that the air-conditioning or ventilation system is so poorly engineered that is simply sucks all the smoke from other parts of the hotel into your room anyway! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE and another reason we will NEVER stay at the Crowne Plaza again. And let me assure you that tiny bottle of lilac linen spray is not sufficient to combat the onslaught of smoke. If only that were possible! A few other ideas in response to some of the other reviewers comments. The lights in our lighted closets DID do out when the doors were closed, so we did not have to contend with that. And I agree with some of the other reviewers - the safes are laughably small. About a foot wide and perhaps two inches deep. "Really? Really? Then you try to get your valuables in there!" And I don't travel with many valuables. Ludicrous! I found the staff friendly enough - unlike some of the other reviewers. The parking costs $12.00 for a 24-hour period and had in/out privileges. Pretty standard. The exhaust fan in the bathroom did not draw and the room stayed steamy all morning - why?, why? Why ask why? Towels are provided at pool side. Very good. And there is a separate area for sun-bathers away from the pool itself. VERY GOOD! But I felt the pool was under-chlorinated (dangerous) and it was filled with dead insects - it needed to be skimmed. We got out when someone in the pool suggested it was filled with salt water. It was simply under-chlorinated so it did not seem like most other "public" pools that one experiences! Ugh - a third time! Skip this place if you are able. We got a deal on Hotwire that I feel was not worth it in hindsight. There are so many choices in Mission Valley as well as LaJolla and San Diego and environs - surely there are better hotels that the Crowne Plaza!This was the worst hotel I have ever had the great displeasure of staying in. I've paid less for a room in NYC and I've paid more, but what you get for your money at this Sheraton compares extremely unfavorably with any other hotel I have ever stayed in. It's not because the hotel is busy and noisy -- although it's both of these -- one must expect this when staying in a large NYC hotel, but is solely the result of a poorly trained, extremely rude staff, who don't have the first clue about how to provide satisfactory customer service. First of all, when I called ahead of time to confirm my reservation (it wasn't showing up on SPG) and asked to be transferred to the front desk, I was transferred to a recording system, and then put on hold until the computer hung up on me. This happened three times. I hope some of you can understand the frustration of this, and the ominous feeling this would give a guest about their prospective stay. So I called back and asked to speak with an on-duty manager. They connected me to a woman named Andrea Williams. I explained my frustration at being hung up on three times, and that I just wanted to confirm my reservation. She simply confirmed my reservation and asked if there were anything else she could do for me. I said an apology would be great and some indication that she might look into whatever the problem was with the phone system would be appropriate. She very disingenuously said she would and hung up on me. No apology. Just rudeness. This is not an appropriate response for anyone in a customer service position. So I called Gary Sims, the hotel manager, and left him a voicemail letting him know about my experience and how it left me very unexcited about my coming stay. Of course, he never bothered to respond. Upon checking in, I found the hotel extremely noisy and busy, but as I said this is to be expected. There was a long line at the understaffed reception desk, but I was happy that my Starwood Gold Status saved me from that debacle. The room was small, but adequate. I noted that the room was quite warm, and immediately set the thermostat to its coldest position and put the fan on high. I then went down to meet friends for dinner. When I returned I had been out of the room for several hours, and it was still too warm for me to sleep comfortably. I like to sleep in a cooler than average room. Temps should be below 70 degrees, or I really have a hard time sleeping. This is why hotel a/c and heat units have thermostats...or so I thought. It was now about midnight, so I called down to the front desk. Again it was inadequately staffed and there was no one to answer guests questions...I waited on hold for nearly 15 minutes before getting to talk to someone. They said they'd send up someone from engineering. I waited....no one showed up. I tried to call the front desk again, but again too long a wait. It was now 12:30am and I just decided it would be better to visit the front desk personally. After waiting -- even more disgruntled guests were there now, and only two receptionists were present at this huge hotel -- I asked if I could change rooms to a cooler room, they said they would send someone up, I said that I'd already waited for someone to come up. They said they get him there quicker. Finally an engineer showed and -- of course -- told me there was nothing he could do. Oy! Back down to the front desk I went. After waiting another twenty minutes out came Mr. Long -- a manager -- to take care of me...Yeah! He came up to my room and announced that the temperature was fine! Hallelujah, I'd been up and complaining for absolutely no reason. All I needed was Mr. Long to tell me that my discomfort was all in my head. I explained it was not a comfortable temperature for me. He suggested I sleep on top of their "heavenly bed" blanket. "After all," he explained, "it's a heavy blanket." (I wouldn't allow this man to run a Nathans Hotdog stand in New Jersey, nevermind a hotel in NYC!) Absolutely, outrageously rude and incompetent. Where does Sheraton train its employees? Attica? I told Mr. Long that since they were unable to deliver an adequate room, I simply wanted to check out immediately so that I could check into the W Hotel nearby -- at an additional profit for his parent company Starwood by the way. He refused and let me know that I would be charged for that evenings accomodations no matter what. After a long argument he finally agreed to do me the "FAVOR" of not "PENALIZING" me if I chose to check out the following day. INCREDIBLE! I checked into the W New York the next day. And although the initial room they put me in was also too warm, you'll never guess what they said... They said, "we are so sorry Mr. Carp, please let us find you a more comfortable room." Which they promptly did...and I lived happily ever...well for the next two days. Point is, it takes so little to make a dissapointed guest into a satisfied guest. We can all understand when there are issues with equiptment or other things outside of the personal control of hotel employees. What is absolutelty unacceptable is a staff that cannot simply understand that all a guest needs is a sincere apology and a genuine effort to correct that which has gone wrong. Stores like Nordstroms, and many other companies have recognized the value of such a philosophy, and train their employees accordingly. In it's New York Hotel and Towers I urge Sheraton to start from scratch, as it will never serve its customers adequately until the replace all of its managers. Do yourself a favor and stay at any other hotel in Manhattan. My mother liked the Marriot in Times Square very much, and I've had excellent stays at the W New York, the W Tuscany, Swishotel's The Drake, and The Paramount. Very Sincerely, Ed CarpI was a guest at the Element by Westin. I checked in on Thursday, 10 June, and I am scheduled to check out on Monday, 14 June. We were staying there for our Anniversary trip. Our room was supposed to be pre-paid on 07 June in an amount of $467.04. On 12 June, we noticed that the charge for the room was not billed but an authorization for $722.80 was being held on the account. The authorization for $722.80 consisted of $467.04 for the room and $255.80 for incidentals. Here is the problem. The front desk manager told us that the Westin tried to bill our debit card on 07 June and the card declined. I know this is not true because I called my bank and the transaction never tried to come through and the funds were always there there anyway. I asked the front desk manager for a transaction number from the bank that was given from the alleged decline and she was unable to provide that transaction number. The other part of the problem is that the Westin alleges that since our debit card was declined on 07 June, they charged us a higher amount for incidentals. Usually, incidentals are $100 but when a card is declined this amount increases to $100 per day. This makes no sense because if the lesser amount, $467.04, was allegedly declined, then how can the Westin authorize the higher amount of $722.80? If the smaller amount was allegedly unavailable then the higher amount should have never been able to be authorized if, indeed, the funds were unavailable. The funds were always available. Also, if this policy is true this further makes no sense because if we were supposed to be charged a $100 per day incidental rate since the card allegedly declined, then why were incidentals authorized at $255.80 instead of $400 ($100 per day for 4 days, the length of my reservation). This is the bottom line, our debit card was authorized at a higher amount for incidentals since the room and tax amount allegedly declined. So, we were penalized for a decline that never happened. And, it appears that the Westin just pulled a figure for incidentals out of the sky since the higher/penalized incidental rate does not even match the rate in the Westin policy. The front desk manager told us there was nothing she could do since it was Saturday and she told us we could call the general manager. So, I called the general manager, David Smith, and talked to him about our concerns. David Smith was beyond terrible. He told me that he was not at the hotel, that he was in New York City and if the front desk manager said there was nothing she could do then nothing could be done. He proceeded to tell me that he would not do anything to address my concern and when I checked out everything would balance out. He told me that he would not make any calls to Westin at a higher level to see how this happened; he also proceeded to tell me that even if he was willing to make some calls nothing could be done today since it's Saturday. His unwillingness to even address my concern was appalling. Before I left the front desk, the front desk manager ended up calling higher level Westin and the authorization was released and she billed the debit card for the room and tax. Funny how she was able to do that when she and her general manager told me that nothing could be done. Technically, my issue was resolved but I am writing this review because of the horrible way David Smith talked to me on the phone. We could have taken our business anywhere, but we chose to come to the Westin. What a mistake !! Is this Westin policy? Does the Westin not train their management staff in customer service? My request was for the Westin to correct an error that they made and all I received was disrespect and lack of concern. I expected him to at least be willing to investigate the issue, but he told me he would not do anything. I don't work directly in customer service but I am expected to address the concerns of those who are impacted by what I do and the decisions I make. I try my best to be responsive and professional because that is my job and it's just common courtesy, This is a fairly new property and if the Westin continues to treat their customers this way they won't be around for long. At this point, we have no interest in ever staying at a Element by Westin property. We would much rather spend our money at a property where the management has a willingness to address concerns and/or operate in accordance with the policies and procedures of the organization. Perhaps that's why the customer service was so bad because there is no structure in the organization. We are so disappointed. We don't make a habit of paying people to disrespect us. Apparently a paying customer has little significance until a review like this is written. A very sad state.Do not stay at this hotel!!!!! If you donâ€™t feel like reading this entire review then the only thing you really need to know is that I would not recommend this hotel to anyone because we found a mouse in our room. Also, even if the mouse issue was taken care of, I still would not recommend this hotel to anyone based on the terrible customer service we received from the Assistant Front Desk Supervisor regarding this issue. My wife and I had booked and pre-paid for this hotel through Book-it.com for 6 nights in late May 2011. The hotel was listed on the website as 3 stars and was going for an average of $140 plus tax per night. Like many similar websites the identity of the hotel was only revealed to us after confirming the booking. We decided to take our chance considering the price was so affordable compared to other accommodations in New York City. The location was also great (Theatre district â€“ next to Ed Sullivan Theatre, walking distance from Times Square and Central Park) and we figured if it was listed as a three star hotel it couldnâ€™t be too bad. Some of our friends had also used the same website to book a â€œmystery hotelâ€� in New York, through which they were also booked at the Ameritania, and had no problems - they said it wasnâ€™t the greatest hotel but for only 6 nights and considering we probably wouldnâ€™t be spending too much time in the room it was good enough. We didnâ€™t have very high expectations for this hotel. These expectations went even lower after we read some of the reviews, however, the price was right and we were willing to put up with a less than ideal place for a few nights. We can put up with a lotâ€¦our main concern was cleanliness, mainly that there were no bed bugs. Upon arriving at the hotel I could see that the lobby and lounge area had been renovated fairly recently. It looked decent but we knew that this wouldnâ€™t be an accurate reflection of the rest of the hotel based on the reviews that we had read. We were booked in room 215. Of course the room hadnâ€™t been renovated yet, which explains the cheap price. On one hand I expected that we would be getting a room that hadnâ€™t been renovated yet but based on the hotel managementâ€™s response to other customerâ€™s complaints on this website (that renovations should be complete by May 2011) I had some hope that we would get a newly renovated room. Unfortunately, from what it looked like the renovations at this hotel wouldnâ€™t be done for some time. It looked as though our entire floor still needed to be re-doneâ€¦there were rooms with the doors left open that were completely gutted, construction material lying around, etc. I never actually saw any other guests on our floor (although I did see some contractors walking around) and it was eerily quiet which made me think we were the only ones staying on the floor. Who knows how many other floors were like this. The room wasnâ€™t great which wasnâ€™t a surprise. It was small (which we didnâ€™t mind) and dark (which we also didnâ€™t mind except for it made it hard to see if the room was cleaned properly). The first thing we did was check the mattress for any signs of bed bugs â€¦thankfully we didnâ€™t find anything. The floor looked like it hadnâ€™t been vacuumed recently, the washroom stunk, and the bathtub had some hairs in it. The water pressure and temperature for the shower wasnâ€™t consistent. Still, as we had low expectations anyways we were content with making this our home for 6 nights. It wasnâ€™t until night number 4 that we had our encounter with the mouse. It was about 2 in the morning when my wife had heard some rustling in the garbage can and saw the mouse poke its head out. I saw it running along the wall towards the corner of the room. There are a lot of things that we are willing to put up with but having rodents running around our room is not one of themâ€¦ I called the front desk to report the problem. At this point I was still willing to stay at Ameritania if they offered me a renovated room as we wanted to spare ourselves the inconvenience of having to move hotels in the middle of the night. The maintenance guy came up to our room and as he wasnâ€™t acting surprised I figured this was a problem that he had seen before although he was adamant that he had never received any such complaints. The only other room that was available was another unfinished room directly above ours. I checked it out and it looked a little better but we didnâ€™t take it. Front desk set up another hotel for us (Sheraton Tribeca). The Sheraton was great but it wasnâ€™t as central and cost $330 plus tax per night. The front desk staff at Sheraton said that they had a few other guests from Ameritania transfer to Sheraton earlier in the night. The front desk guy working the late shift at Ameritania the night we checked out was fine to deal with. He was nice and seemed like he genuinely felt bad that we had to move hotels in the middle of the night. He was also the one who called around to see what other hotels were available. Unfortunately, he couldnâ€™t deal with our refund and told us to contact the manager the next day stating that management wouldnâ€™t be in until 3 in the afternoon. We were told that management would be advised of our issue. The following afternoon we went back to the hotel to speak with the Assistant Front Desk Supervisor. The supervisor wasnâ€™t yet aware of our problem, which surprised me as I figured the issue would be a priority for management to deal with although, to be fair, he had just started his shift shortly before we arrived. When I explained my problem to him he initially told me that he didnâ€™t have the authority to give me a refund and told me I had to speak to the Hotel Manager. I was disappointed that he wasnâ€™t more willing to help outâ€¦I thought that, as a supervisor, he would make every effort to properly address a customer complaint, especially one such as this. After speaking with him for some time he finally said that he could approve a refund...which still wasnâ€™t good enough as he said that he would only refund us for 1 and a half nights. Again he claimed that I would have to speak with the hotel manager who, of course, wouldnâ€™t be in for a few more days and who he had no way to contact. Again, after some time he reluctantly agreed to charge for only 2 nights. He stated that we would have to contact bookit.com for the refund and only did so himself when I asked him to. I was content with this outcome although I was not happy with how long it took before he agreed to give a refund for more than 1 and a half days. Regardless of how cheap the price is and regardless of the prime location do not stay at this hotel. Even after the renovations are complete and the mouse problem is fixed I still wouldnâ€™t stay here based on the terrible customer service from the supervisor.Good cake BUT: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees.OK, I never write these things, but this place was such a dump I feel the need to steer folks clear of it. First of all, my girlfriend and I are seasoned travelers who've backpacked thru Europe and done the litany of youth hostels and budget hotels. We are both architects, and are very open minded to non-conventional accomodations. So, we found the Dominion Hotel in the Lonely Planet guide and looked it up on the web. They have a really really nice looking website that completely sucked us in. Beware! Seriously, it makes the place look like a friendly, savvy, "artistic" place. It seemed like it would be right up our alley. We booked a month in advance, and called the night before to confirm. The girl working the desk didn't speak English very well and was unable to use the computer to find our reservation. She assured us it was there, but wasn't able to pull it up. We arrived in Vancouver the next day, and to our dismay, found that you couldn't reach the hotel by car because all of the blocks around the hotel were blocked off for a bike race. Now, I understand that this bike race is once a year and there is nothing the hotel can do about it, but they should have informed us the night before when we called that the garage they recommended parking in was not going to be accessible. So, after driving around the worst part of Vancouver for a while, we found a sketchy garage sandwiched between a salvation army soup kitchen and a women's drop-in center. The garage had no attendant and was of the self-service pre-pay style. The place stunk of urine and we decided there was no way in hell we were leaving the rental car in there. So, we called the hotel to ask for a suggestion. We got the same girl from the night before, and spent 35 mintues (literally) on the phone with her trying to determine where we should park. Now, I can't fault her language skills (as I've been all over Europe without speaking their languages), but a basic skill a person needs to work the front desk of a hotel that has no parking is the ability to tell the guests where to go to park! Anyway, I was about to cancel the reservation right there, but my girlfriend talked me down and we drove around until we found a garage in a little less seemly environment. Now it was time to run the gauntlet. We live in San Francisco, and I've done work all over the worst parts of Oakland, but the three block walk between the parking garage and the "hotel" were some of the worst I've seen. TONS of drug addicts on the sidewalks and in the alleys and homeless people on every corner. Again, this isn't the hotel's fault, and it is a neighborhood in transition (ie, is currently undergoing gentrification), but damn, it was scary at midday on a weekday! And then we've got those dumb rollerbag carry-on things trailing behind us screaming "we're tourists". Seriously, we lived in San Francisco's tenderloin for 3 years and I've never felt that much of a target. Finally we arrive at the hotel. The girl at the front desk was very friendly, but it became immediatley apparent that she was ill equipped and untrained for her job. She was unable to find our reservation at all in the computer, but said "oh, it doesn't matter, there are plenty of rooms". Man, that just burns me up. What's the point of making a reservations if your employees can't enter them or find them?! We can clearly see two other men in the back office that seem to be of managerial status, but they never come out or attempt to help in any way. So, my girlfriend (always cool and collected) squares away the room and we get our keys. There is no elevator, so we lug our bags up the stairs. Half way up the staircase it becomes immediatley apparant that this is not fully a hotel. It's more like an SRO (single room occupany) that is being transitioned into a hotel. Some of the rooms have numbers on the doors and some don't. We passed two middle aged residents in the hallway smoking joints. Being from San Francisco, this isn't alarming to us in any way, but man, what a first impression! After navigating the signless hallway, we located our room and opened the door (which has some hearts painted on the door) to find something a bit less than expected. Instead of "artsy", we found a pretty plain room in sore need of renovation. The bedroom was painted flat black, there was a beat up armchair (complete with mystery stains), a rickety table and a nasty bed with stained mattress. The sheets had cigarette burn holes in them, the comforter was covered in dark stains, the carpet was at least 15 years old, the toilet wouldn't flush and there was nothing vaguely artistic except for some red christmas lights strung in the middle of the ceiling. I mean seriously, "art hotel"? My dorm room in college was cleaner and more artistic! Needless to say, we returned to the counter and checked out immediately. I can appreciate the idea of the Dominion Hotel, and I hope that one day they do manage to convert the building to a wonderful art hotel. The exterior of the building is great, but right now the interior is an ugly building full of druggies (that they're most likely trying to evict) in a dodgey part of town. Avoid this one! ps-> I've noticed from reading other posts for this hotel that the management is fond of refuting the negative posts. I read one that said that they've "recently renovated" and that all of the linens "are new and clean". This is certainly a lie as our room was neither renovated nor had clean linens. I mean really, I've stayed in youth hostels in church basements that had 100 year old linens that were cleaner and better cared for than these!In the beginning of March I booked a special hotwire deal and to my very pleasant surprise endined up with the Westin Harbour Castle. My curernt apartment had a mould infestation routing through the ventilation system which caused sickness in me. So the thought of staying at this hotel was a dream come true for me. A place where I could finally sleep and relax. When checking in I asked the extremely polite Service Receptionist if the rooms were hypo-allergenic. She was unsure of this fact. She went to verify the information adn quickly found out that the rooms were not. Ok....not a problem as I'm relatively an easy-going individual. The Receptionist said that she would accomodate Housekeeping to make sure the vents in my room were properly dusted. Great!! That's amazing service!! She also informed me that it would be a 30 min wait. I asked if there was a bar. She of course said yes and pointed to its direction. Again very nice service. When I ventured over to it (afternoon period) there was no one tending the bar. Since I was sick and dehydrated all i wanted wasd to have a drink , sit and relax. I then noticed 2 other women sitting by the large bay wondows enjoying the lovely scenery while enjoying their beverages. In fact many ppl were enjoying their bevs. I go up to the bar attempting to choose my boisson of choice. As I make my decision, one of the chefs walked y me quickly and back into the kitchen. So I thought perhaps I thought ask him where the bartender was. I walked back to the area..called out to one of the chefs. He informed me that he couldn't help me. Alright..that's fine. All I wnated to know was who could help me obtain my goal of becoming dehydrated. Instead he just gave me a dirty look and 'shoe'd' me away. I sadly walked back to a little tony chair to lean back on since I was losing energy. I notice the same chef walk by, again witht the same dirty look, right by me. Then again a couple mins later back to his kitchen to do his job. A couiple miniutes adter that I was greated by 2 menacing security guards asking me who I was waiting for. This to me suggested that they thought I wasn't a client of the hotel. Since I was sick and looked very run down, this also suggested to me that they were pretty much implying that I was a low-class vagabond. This of course upset me and I started to cry. I cried because I was sleep deprived and dehydrated. Not to mentioned incredibly insulted. They tried to give me dirty tap water in attempt to calm me down but I kept refusing. Why? Well regular tap water has bad chemicals in it that casues more dehydration in me. As I stood up to walk away they demanded to see my photo ID. More insults. Insult after insult. As I grwe more upset, they kept trying to push their flirhy tap water down my throat. NICE eh. This while trying to document the secuirty information on my credit card plus photo ID. This is not correct procedure as I told them I no lonfger wanted ot stay in a place like that. They did not comply right away. What is was wrong with this picture? EVERYTHING!! They judged a book by its cover and came out the loser. The loser in which way. Well I happen to come from a wealthy family, plus have my wealth self-made, mind you. All I wanted to do was relax finally then take advantage of as many spa treatments as I could to start feeling like a human being again. What they did was pretty much spat in my face. That is the truth. In this in age. The long days of a recession, businesses have to realise that if their entity is to shine and blossom, clients cannot be treated as numbers or dollar signs. That is what they did to me. Sorry they humiliated me infront of everyone. Me, being a 30 year old, humilated infront of everyone in the hotel, whom probably had more $$ than everyone. If you want my opinion, do not stay at a place like this. There is a far better place around the corner . The newly renovated Intercontinental : AZURA. They, on the other hand, treated me like royalty. If you think I'm bluffing, go ahead...find out for yourself. I did and what an experience that was. I will never forget it EVER. That is why It was important for me to write this review. They wronged me..and they could possibly do it to you..at the expense of your wallet and dignity. Never again will this happen to me. Please do take this review seriously. If the Westin Harbour Castle is reading this, you will know and remember who I was. How could you forget? You made a grown women whom was ill and tired feel like a sick sobbin child in public. With everyone's eyes on me. I hope this is lesson about client service as it pertains to its authenticity. There's no such thing as a "high valued customer". Looks may be deceiving!!!We were going to treat ourselves to a weekend break in London looking forward to some rest, relaxation and entertainment. This was our Capital City and always seemed to offer the best in accommodation and activity. We decided to use one of LastMinute.comâ€™s â€œTop Secretâ€� hotels for our stay in London. The priority of our booking was that the room should offer â€œTwin Bedsâ€�. Not too many hotels offered such a room, so we decided to especially go for this â€œTop Secretâ€� hotel as it offered â€œTwin Bedâ€� rooms. On booking we were advised that our hotel was a 4 Star hotel. It was the Tophams Hotel in Belgravia and our booking confirmed a twin bedded room. We received the written paperwork to this effect. â€œThe Tophams Hotel was advertised as one of Londonâ€™s newest four-star hotels providing the ultimate in style, comfort and peaceful surroundings in the heart of Belgraviaâ€�. With this concept in mind, we proceeded to the hotel. We were looking forward to our weekend break in London, but the reality was a far different story. The Hotel was a â€œhotel from hellâ€�. On checking in, we were told that our double room was ready. We told the receptionist that we had booked a twin bedded room and had confirmation in writing from Lastminute.com; which I was able to show them. They said the booking they had received was for a double room. However, they never showed us this booking. They said no twin rooms were available until the next night. This was not acceptable, but the receptionist did not seem to care unduly, did not seem to have a full use of the English language. Eventually she offered us an â€œupgradeâ€� which would entail putting a single bed into a â€œMewsâ€� double (Mews 5). We said we would look at the room before any decision was made. On entering the room there was a musty smell, dirty carpet and closed dark curtains. True there was a Double and single bed: which in truth was a camp bed with tubular legs. It would probably have taken the weight of a child, but doubtful of the comfort for either a grown man or woman. Half the lights did not work, the room was small and no room for the furniture within. Then we had the shock of the shower/bath/toilet area. This area went below the road and was suffering very badly from damp. The paint on the walls was peeling in many places, including within the shower cubicle. Mould was everywhere. It was disgusting. It was unhealthy, offensive and certainly not what we had paid good money for, which the hotel and Lastminute.com were all too quick to receive from us. The only thing that was worse than this was the second alternative we were offered, namely Mews 4. The bed was smaller, the sewage smell even more overpowering, the wet carpet, the brick wall view from the window. Certainly a far cry from the description of their website, which said, â€œAll guest rooms at the Tophams Hotel are finished to a very high standard of modern comfort and style.â€� We declined the offer of this room and once again reiterated that our booking was for a twin room, money had been accepted for a twin room. As a last resort the girl behind the desk offered to book us into the Vegas Hotel for Saturday night and we could return to The Tophams on Sunday when a room would be available. After checking this latest offer on the Internet, we found the Vegas Hotel was a 3 star hotel, but we had paid for a 4 star. They did have a twin room available, but the pictures on the website were not appealing and the reports on Trip Advisor would have been enlightening. We also mentioned the Vegas Hotel to the French family as they were really stuck for accommodation at short notice, on seeing them at breakfast the next morning they had also declined this invitation. We were rather surprised at the lack of Management over the weekend, but according to the receptionist there is never a manager present at weekends. We were amazed at this due to the activity of the Marathon and 2 football semi finals meaning the City was packed with people. Our visit to the dining room for breakfast was again a disappointment. We were told we could have a Full English Breakfast but firstly we had difficulty getting to a table as they were put so close together no-one could access the row behind if people were sitting on the tables at the front. 14 tables in a small space take some manoeuvring around. The food was on one side of the room but when we went to take up the full breakfast, there was no bacon, hash browns, the sausages ran out before we could get there, almost no scrambled egg. It was a long wait and in fact I had finished the breakfast that was available before the bacon arrived from a chef who was cooking who knows what, who knows where. There seemed to be only a service room, no kitchen nearby the dining room that we could ascertain. On Sunday when we came back in the afternoon, we were advised that the twin room we had been allocated was now ready and so we duly took the key to investigate. The room was a great deal better than the previous one, but one of the curtains refused to open (jammed), the beds seemed narrower than usual, the lights were not all working in the en suite and when I went to have a shower, the shower door came off in my hand! Once again we had to notify reception and they said it would be sorted. If a maid had opened the door to clean the shower, she could have been injured as it was the complete shower door that gave way. The tiles on the floor rocked as you walked on them, the painting and decor in the en suite left challenges to quality and once again the price paid was not matched by the service offered. All in all, it is the last time we would go to this hotel, my wife has assured me that it is the last time she would trust Lastminute.com â€œTop Secretâ€�.Not what expected August 2004My Fianc茅 and I just returned from visiting the Sirenis Cocotal Beach Resort and are glad to be home. This resort was nothing like we expected. We read several reviews after we had already booked our reservations some good and some bad but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and not cancel. Looking back I wish we had at least changed resorts before traveling to the Dominican Republic. The Island was very beautiful, crystal clear water, great weather and that's about it. We are avid travelers and have always enjoyed each adventure except for this one. It started out really great - we met some fun people at the airport (staying at a different resort of course - The Paradisus - they said it was Awesome) anyway we made it to Punta Cana airport and easily made it through and received our luggage very quickly, we were impressed. We found the bus that would shuttle us to our hotel and were greeted with a warm welcome by a couple of young men working for the agency we booked with. So far so good... the bus ride to the resort was not the best but the gentlemen made it fun, they were very friendly and spoke broken English but good enough to understand. They told us our hotel was far out and that it would take over an hour so if we wanted they would stop along the way for beer, rum or bathroom breaks. This was great because we were in the mood to start our vacation; we stopped for beer and then another stop for rum (Mamajuana) - make sure you ask about this rum to find out the story behind it. Anyway after two shots of Rum we loaded back on our bus and eventually made it to our resort. I didn't notice the potholes or the driving since I was feeling pretty good, (wish I had drank the rum on the trip back to the airport). Finally we pulled up to the Resort, it was very nice, beautiful landscaping, well kept grounds, and we were ready to relax. We get checked in, we had upgraded to an Ocean View room when they told us which bldg we were in they began to laugh. I know why now because it was in T close to the beach but so far away from everything and there was no other transportation other than your feet at this resort. Oh well no problem because I like being close to the beach. We get to our room and open the door to find a mess. Our room wasn't clean - no big deal, the maid was right there and she said she would clean immediately. We left our luggage and were starving so walked around looking for some food. Only one snack place was open at this time - 3:00 pm. It looked like it had been left out since noon. I ate french fries. Okay not the way I wanted to start out - finally 1 hr later our room was clean but with no bed covers or wash cloths. Finally got those and rested. It just got worse from there our room was cleaned everyday by the same maid and she wasn't very good, nice but not good. It was never done at the same time, it seemed as if anytime we were ready to get out of the sun - she was in the room. One day no toilet paper was left (which we definitely needed) and towels she used to clean were left in our room, along with trash. She never refilled our refrigerator. It became very annoying. The worst thing had to be the food and customer service - I ate bread and french fries most of the time because that was the only thing that my taste buds would allow me to keep down. However one night we went to The Gourmet restaurant. You have to pay $20 US dollars each to eat there - we thought, it should be good. We were wrong, it was the worst meal we had. One night was included in our upgrade so luckily we did not have to pay for it. Our glasses always sat empty at least 5 minutes before we finally were able to flag someone down for a refill. It was like this at all the reservation only restaurants. The Mediterranean and Italian Restaurant had the best food we thought but still with poor service. Half way into our trip we wanted to leave but stuck it out. This will be a vacation I will forget as soon as I finish this review along with a letter to our travel agency. If you want to go to a resort with nothing to do but sit at the pool or beach all day with minimal water activities than this resort it great but don't expect any shopping or site seeing unless you want to spend all day on a bus. One day a lot of time was spent in the bathroom so take some Imodium AD or Pepto and I didn't drank any water or did I brush my teeth in it so not for sure what happened. It was just a bad vacation and actually a little stressful because we were surrounded by rude people, I won't mention their nationality. Finally Friday and time to go home... YEAH.... we almost didn't make it because I thought our driver -same as before was going to crash our van. He was driving 130 KM approx. 80 mph, I'm surprised this van went that fast. It was way to fast for the dirt roads we were on, it was 2 lanes and he made it three, anytime we passed a motorcycle, mule, person walking, I thought we were going to hit them because he came so close. Another couple that arrived and leaving the same time as us were sick and this ride was making it worse. They too had a bad time and were really upset. All in all I will never return to this resort, maybe one day we will get back to the DR but probably not. The worse things again at this resort were the Food and Customer service, which to us is very important. One other note - we found only a few people working there that spoke any english. But just as we did anyone who reads this should form his or her own opinion just do some serious checking into this resort before making your vacation reservations.I know that everyone is entitled to their opinion, and that everyone as different expectation of an hotel, but from my point of view this was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had the misfortune to endure. And I am exceptionally angry at the people who wrote nice things about this place because it is through their reviews that I thought it would be a decent place to stay instead of the dirty hellhole it in fact turned out to be. The entire hotel is filthy, badly run, and staffed with unhelpful, unfriendly people who thinks itâ€™s funny when your complain about how bad things are. Myself and my daughter went down to London on business for six nights, and therefore wanted something reasonable and clean, and for almost eighty pounds per night, while you know youâ€™re not going to get outstanding, I expected at least a basic degree of comfort and cleanliness. Instead, the room we were put in was absolutely filthy. Every towel and sheet was covered in dark brown stains, caused no doubt by the fact that they, and I use this term loosely, â€œwashâ€� such things in an outside space underneath the main entrance next to bags of rubbish. This being a big deal for me when I travel, I asked for new bedding and towels, only to be given even filthier ones that I wouldnâ€™t let a dog sleep on. Bottom line, We reached such a level of despair with the situation that we went out and brought new sheets and towels from a store nearby, just after we went around trying to find alternative accommodation. We then had to spend extra time and money in a launderette cleaning these items and some of the hotels own things because the management couldnâ€™t see anything wrong with them. The place is, in a word, a hovel! Lights donâ€™t work and are broken. There is dirt and grim everywhere that the cleaners canâ€™t be bothered to clean. Tables are thick in black dirt that shows that they havenâ€™t been cleaned in ages. Toilet seats are broken. It takes ages to flush waste away. The shower had hair caught all the way around the door. Wardrobes are crooked. Drinking glasses have cracks in them. The kettle provided has filth and grim at the bottom, while the cups clearly havenâ€™t been washed from their last use. The maids walk around cursing in either Polish or Russian because they donâ€™t like doing anything other than smoke in the hallways and hover the stairs, which they are always doing because plaster is falling off the walls and covering the carpet. Even something like a â€™Do not disturbâ€™ sign has been stolen from another hotel, and it doesnâ€™t end there. The stairs are steep, and if you stay in the attic (which tends to leak in, by all accounts), there is no handrail to hold onto. This is also true of the breakfast area, which is underground and is not easy to reach if you are disabled in any way. There is damp patches on the hallways walls, and bits of wooden skirting board lying around with nails sticking out of it, which is just the sort of thing you want to see if you should have little children with you. Breakfast is yet another farce. I know that it is only a basic continental breakfast, but when we went down once at about eight in the morning, all their was was two little bowls of cereal laid out on a trestle table. No milk, no toast, no buns, no nothing. And the only answer you get if you complain is â€˜Well, no one else has complainedâ€™. This is their get out of jail free card; something they use to let themselves of the hook for the appalling condition of the hotel and to make you feel as though you are being unreasonable for asking for anything better. I donâ€™t care if no one else has complained before. I found it completely unacceptable, and I find the idea of being treated like a third class citizen because I wanted to pay a reasonable price for a hotel instead of the extortionate fees charged by other London hotels unacceptable, so I decided that before I left, I would make my feelings clear in a letter to the management that I left on the door. I will admit that my language wasnâ€™t the nicest, but the experience was so terrible that I wasnâ€™t interested in being gracious to ungracious hosts. This was when one of the men who runs the hotel decided to chase after myself and my daughter and scream insults at us from across the street. They are rude people running a vile hotel, and anyone who says otherwise mustnâ€™t have any sort of standards when it comes to where they stay. So for anyone thinking of going to this hotel, and is fooled by the deceptive photographs and so-called â€˜reasonableâ€˜ price tag, be aware that this is a terrible place and look elsewhere, as anything would be better than this.Atmosphere is a bore.Make more tables- perhaps a rooftop bar?Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.This was my 4th stay at the MGM Grand over the 15 years I've been going to Vegas and like all the previous times I've been there, I came out extremely disappointed this time as well. In the past I've stayed at hotels rated much lower than the MGM (ie: the Excalibur, Holiday-inn, etc.), but in all honesty, I've never had so many problems! My first preference when I go to Vegas is naturally the Wynn (if I can manage to find a good deal online) and if not the Wynn, then either the Mirage, Bellagio or Treasure Island - whichever one fits my particular budget. Since I was with a group and money was an object, we decided to *settle* for the MGM where we received a Player's Club rate of $79/night. I have never really been a fan of the MGM Grand in the past, but was some how convinced by others that this time would be different. And that I was sure to end up having a great time. Sure! Why not? (NOT!) Regardless of how much you pay for your room, you should always expect the best service. It's not like the bell guy, or casino staff know how much you paid. For all they know, I may have paid $149-$179/night (the posted rate on their website). So where do I start? We check-in at the airport to avoid the massive line ups at the hotel...the check-in was fine, only about 5-6 minutes and I had my keys. We get to the hotel go up the elevators and about 5 miles and 15 minutes later we finally reach our room. We were told the room was a newly renovated room, with new beds, furniture, etc. I made sure we received a Grand Tower room (supposedly 450 sq ft) and not one of those "new" dinky West Wing rooms (325 sq ft). The room: Why don't I just go ahead and list the problems...1. The room has no mirror on the outside, but instead has two inside the washroom! 2. The sink, the toilet and the tub all had problems with draining and flushing. The sink would fill up within 2-3 minutes while just trying to wash your face! When I asked for a change in rooms, they claimed to be full. Well then why was I able to book additional rooms on their website? BS! ***3. BED BUGS!!! My cousin ended up getting about 12 bed bug bites all over her leg! Funny enough, as soon as she got into her bed, she complained about being itchy, but just figured that it was either her imagination or nothing more than a general itch. What happens? She wakes up the next morning with all those bites. So we walk over to the front desk and let them know about it. The lady said that I have to first file a complaint with security and then come back and she'll definitely upgrade us to a better/cleaner room. After spending about an hour with security and giving them a report on her bed bug bites (formal report, pictures, etc). We went back to the front desk and requested a room change, but weren't going to be happy with just another standard room. We wanted either a portion of our money back, or a better room. The lady said she wasn't able to do anything until they took my cousin to a doctor, had her examined and in addition to that they would also have to collect samples from the room and send them off to the lab. Without doing any of that, the best she could do is change our room. So let me get this straight, you're spending 3 nights in Vegas, you discover your leg the next morning with nothing but bed bug bites all over it, you go to the front desk, they make you go through security.. .and then they want to ruin your entire trip by sending you to a doctor for 2 days? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I asked to speak to the manager immediately...a couple minutes later the lady comes back and tells me that they're short staffed and that the manager cannot leave the video/security screens that he's watching at the back (really? since when does a front desk manager have to watch video screens at the back?) I then asked to be able to speak to him over the phone. A completely useless conversation with an uneducated individual who claimed to be the manager. The problems don't stop here...but were all over the hotel! Horrible pool area where you find people gathered like sardines on broken and rusted pool chairs, broken washrooms throughout the hotel, unfriendly staff, rude security officers, you name it. 5000+ rooms and they're short staffed? Give me a break! his hotel is operated by the world's 2nd largest gaming company! My 4th stay at the MGM was definitely my last...regardless of the group, or rate or circumstance, there is absolutely no way I am going back to this hotel (if I can call it that). Be it torn bed sheets, an hour to receive an extra ice bucket or roaches in the room (all past problems) and now the bed bugs...there is no way someone is going to convince me when it comes to the MGM.Stayed here for three nights (two with HW, one with hotel reservation) with my wife. For budgetary reasons and because I was working at a client site close by, we couldn't move but we definitely would have. HW gave this property 3 stars with 70% recommended, so we gave the FP a shot. Bad move... To save you the headache we had from staying here: don't ever consider staying at the Four Points LAX, unless you really have to. What we liked: (a) staff was generally helpful; (b) Hotel has 24 shuttle service to the airport; (c) comfortable seats in the lobby; (d) nice looking furnishings and accessories in the renovated wing. What we didn't like: (1) overall feeling of grime and dirt throughout the hotel, in the renovated lobby, the hallways, though not quite the rooms and most of all in the non-renovated wings; (2) noise from adjacent rooms carried forth into our room, from footsteps to what you will read further down; (3) wireless internet connection only worked in the lobby; (4) hotel management put us in the middle of a large family with unruly children and all-night partying adults, severely disturbing our sleep, and couldn't care less. Pictures try to show how dirty the hotel is, but in case it doesn't come over, imagine that none of the sofas in the lobby every get cleaned, everything has black and other color spots, the carpeting has stains in the newly renovated areas, that should give you a good idea. When we arrived we were assigned to a room in one of the old wings. The musty, mold smell in the hallways was too much for us, the room itself was barely any better. Since a previous reviewer here had alerted us about the renovations we had already asked reception for a room in that renovated wing, but the check in person (Trish) flatly stated that a "large convention just took all our rooms, we are sold out." Not satisfied with the first room, we went back to the front desk. They gave us another room on a higher floor. Also non-renovated. Same complaint about musty, allergy causing smell. Third try: Trish had gone on a break, so we get a room in the renovated wing. These rooms have NO OUTSIDE WINDOWS! If this is a problem for you, wait until they have renovated the rest of the hotel. What this means is that other guests can walk by your room and look at what you're doing...if you don't close the blinds shut. There are carpet stains throughout the property. In the old rooms, in the hallways, everywhere. Also in the newly renovated rooms. So we asked to see another room hoping it might be cleaner. On to room 4 we went. No luck there either, still the renovated wing but on a higher floor, same dirty carpet and now also a bad smell in the room. So we asked for room 3 back and got it, but before we moved in we had to ask housekeeping to clean the tortilla and cookie crumbs off the floor everywhere in the room. Then the real trouble started. Unbeknownst to us, a large family had been assigned to our floor (so much for large conventions, Trish!). Airport hotels get guests coming and going all day and night so one would expect hotels to be more or less solidly built. Not so the Four Points. You can hear everything except regular conversation, regular sound level TV noise and water flowing. So if everyone just opened and closed their room door in a normal fashion and kept conversation civilized, you would not notice your neighbors. We weren't so lucky, so we called security when our neighbors kept slamming the doors, frequently coming and going, after 10:30 at night. Security managed to keep things quiet for about 30 minutes, then the kids in room 352 started jumping around again and the adults in 348 started visiting other parts of the family down the hall, and returning to their room every 15 minutes or so. Called security again, same result. The next night the same story, except that now at 4:30 in the morning I was awakened by a slamming door. At checkout I filled out a security report. Not once did the hotel management offer us any kind of compensation. Not once did they offer to relocate us to another room. Thank you Four Points, but no thanks. If you do end up here, don't be surprised if the Free Wireless Internet doesn't work in your room. We had the hotel's help desk and IT departments work on it for two days and they couldn't get it to work. In the lobby it works fine, but try having a Skype conversation and you're out of luck. About food, skip the breakfast. Not worth your $14 plus tax and tip. Oh, and there are no refrigerators in the renovated rooms. Oh, and yes, you do have to pay for parking: $16. And the coffee bar is only open until 10am. And forget about comfortably lounging by the pool on a hot summer afternoon, the west wing blocks sunlight to the pool later in the day - it gets cold...Everytime I go there I can't pick anything to eat and not because the menu is filled with great things to eat.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

The only time that we weren’t treated poorly was the first fifteen minutes we were there. We went to our rooms, got changed, and went down to the pool. We get there and immediately start getting treated as if we were outsiders of the hotel. We get to the pool and there are very few places to sit but we got there early so we found a spot, we began to walk over to it, and the pool staff stop us and ask for our names and hotel number, etc. They didn’t believe us, we showed them our room key, but they wanted to check at the front desk. By the time they cleared that we were staying there, someone had gotten to the chairs and now we had no where to sit around the pool. So, we had to sit in a different section from the pool. Then, I asked one of the staff members if there were different sections of the pool because I was told there was, he responded “no just this section and there’s a lawn area by the pool” and just walked away as I was still talking to him.(which was very rude). The hotel wasn’t even really that busy or crowded for a fourth of July weekend which is odd, but there was no reason for such rude behavior and it was very unexplainable. Then all of the staff kept giving us attitude. We would tip our waitress and she just grabbed the money and walked away (I have never seen someone so unappreciative for a tip and this happened more than once with her). We tried to walk back to the pool and then they wouldn’t let us, without a wristband. (If we needed a wristband from the beginning, they should have given us one when they allowed us into the pool, and even after when they checked our names under the hotel. I was just so upset so I wanted to speak to a manager, and I went to ask the guy who walked away from me while I was still talking to him, what his name was. He told me his first name, Chris, and I asked for his last and he rudely responded “why?” I explained that I thought it was very rude for him to walk away while I was still talking…he said “I don’t know what you are talking about, you must be thinking of a different person.” I told him that I wasn’t the only one that witnessed it; my fiancé was right next to me. He said, “oh well I thought you were done talking.” (Now he knew we had the conversation where 30 seconds before he acted like I was mistaking him for some other rude staff member) So, I finally found the pool manager Oliver Kroll (the hotel manager said I had to go through the pool manager) and began telling him, how upset I was at how ALL of his staff were treating us. He apologized and offered us a bottle of champagne. I refused and told him that I didn’t want anything; I just wanted him to talk to his staff so the rest of the day would be somewhat enjoyable. He still insisted on a round of drink, I still said that I didn’t want anything more than him talking to his entire staff to change the rude attitudes. He sent a round of drinks anyway. 30 minutes later I laid down to suntan and closed my eyes, and a different rude staff member came by and tapped me and said “ you cant close your eyes.” I asked why and he rudely answered “you can’t close your eyes, it is a liability.” (I have never heard of that, but I listened and got up). Then I started tanning with my glasses on, and he came up to me twice to see if my eyes were open which they were). We had finally had enough and called it an early day and went back to the room. We had hoped that the rude staff ended at the pool area, but that was not the case. We went to try and see fireworks at around 8:45 in the pool area and my fiancé and I went in with shorts 5 minutes before my friend Derrick. When Derrick tried to walk to the pool, he was stopped by staff saying that he was not allowed to enter with shorts on. He said that his party just walked in with shorts, the guy began arguing with him telling him he wouldn’t be allowed to pass and called his staff members for them to help with situation. Then we had enough, we went to the hotel manager Steven Goldberg and he apologized offering us dinner and drinks, we said we didn’t want anything, we want to check out and want to be refunded. He told me to go on and do what I was going to do (we were going to dinner at a restaurant nearby) and he said he will talk to someone higher than him, and that he will call me and make sure I am taken care of. (He definitely did this so he would not have to deal with him face to face and he could just tell me over the phone) We called all the hotels we knew of and all of them were booked, we checked the directory for other hotels, and they were all booked for the night also. An hour later, I got a phone call from the manager Steven Goldberg and he said “there is nothing I can do, because the pool manager bought you guys drinks.” I told him that I would like to pay for the drinks. He said “sorry, there is nothing I can do, Okay...” then he hung up. I have never in my life been treated so poorly by so many people. When we went back to the hotel to sleep because we were told we couldn’t enter the hotel the way we exited it was roped off. We walked around, and then we were stopped by more rude staff and they asked for our room key. We began to explain that our friend wasn’t feeling well and left the restaurant early and took our key with him. The hotel staff member said very rudely, “well you better call him to come down here and give it to you. (Instead of trying to look for our names under the room, he wanted us to call our friend who we said wasn’t feeling well to come down and give us a key.) (keep in mind that you cannot go to your floor in the elevator without a room key, so we had to go to the front desk anyway to get a key, but we cant even get to the front desk because they are stopping us from the front of the hotel). We were so upset and had enough. We called a few more hotels, and settled with a night for Saturday because that was all they had. We went downstairs to the hotel check out and ask for a checkout for the next day and we didn’t want to be charged a cancellation fee. We were able to check out and checked into the Mission bay, Hilton. We were treated so well from the minute we arrived at their property. The San Diego Hard Rock Hotel is one of the worst experiences my friends and I have ever had and I definitely want to be reimbursed.

She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.We arrived late at night (11.30 pm) and the area was scary with unsavoury type of characters lurking in the streets and corners. We arrived at the hotel (if you can call it that), only to be met by an angry, arrogant, rude desk manager. He demanded we give him our passports to photocopy them (we have been travelling for almost 2 months all over the world and this was the 1st time we had to give passports in for photocopying). He said that the photocopier wasn't working and to leave the passports with him and he would return them to us whenever he got around to photocopying them in the next couple of days. I said that I would like to keep our passports and am happy to bring them down to him first thing in the morning if he likes. He shouted at us that he didn't care about Australia and was keeping the passports or we couldn't check into our rooms. I asked if he could copy the information down so that we were able to go to our rooms, so he did. After half an hour we were allowed to go to our room. The area the hotel is in was dirty and was far away from the thriving hub of venice, and does not represent the true Venetian experience. It was filthy and away from the shops and tourist attractions and restaurants. Our room had 3 beds shoved into a smelly dirty room. There was mould on the ceiling, and cracks in the walls, with lumps of plaster cracking and falling on the floor. "The bathroom was filthy. Someone was creeping around outside our door and we felt extremely scared and unsafe. We wanted to get out but it was very late at night and we had no transport means to get out and didn't know where to go. We were told there was internet in the rooms but couldn't see anything. I phoned the angry man at the front desk who said we had to connect it to the tv. There was no means to do this. So I phoned him again, and he said he would send a man from another hotel nearby to help us. Half an hour later a guy arrives, fiddles around with the tv which didn't work properly and informs us that the internet connection is non existant. He phoned the front desk to inform the guy who said there was nothing he could do. We were desperate to get out of here and didn't want to sleep the night. Next I tried phoning family in Australia to see if they could find something on the internet to book us in. The phone didn't work. There was no reception for my mobile phone (I realise this wasn't the hotels fault) however my teenage son had $30 left on his mobile which did have reception. We phoned family in Aust. explained our predicament and asked for help explaining the mobile phone credits would run out soon (which it did after that call.) By now it was around 2 am. Family booked us into a gorgeous hotel in the heart of Venice and tried to phone the hotel to let us know. The man at the front desk supposedly put the phone calls through to our room but we never received them. After one hour with no phone calls coming into our room I tried to phone Australia but the phone wasn't working. I tried for quite some time. In the meantime family trying to be put through into our room and front desk man saying he was trying to put us through but we weren't answering and must be asleep. We were not asleep. We tried to use the phone but it was dead. Family asked him to walk up to our room and let us know that they were trying to phone us, but the guy refused. Our room phone was intermittent. Our cousin phoned us to tell us she had found a hotel and booked it for us but the phone call cut out. We tried phoning our cousin, and other family members who were worried but the phone wasn't working again. Around 6.30 am after our family members had been constantly phoning and trying to get through to us, our cousin insisted someone take a message to us in our room which read "answer your phone". I realised that people had been trying to call us all night. I informed the man at the front desk that the phone was not working and he said that he would get an engineer to work on the phone some time today (engineer??). We looked into the poky, dingy old room that was supposed to be the breakfast room, as we were going to eat breakfast before we left, however, the small amount of food looked of poor quality. Scrambled eggs looked old and stale. Bacon was all fat and greasy. My daughter put a piece of canned pineapple on her plate and had a coffee and was going to have another pineapple ring but the waiter packed it away while my daughter was standing in front of it. I ate nothing. My son ate a stale bread roll. We checked out that morning and moved to the centre of Venice and went to the Bauer hotel which was beautiful and everything you expect your Venetian experience to be. Do not go to this hotel.Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!.Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes "just like" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is "natural" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to "optimize" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's "optimized" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to "optimize." (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under "Todd O'Connor". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by "Todd O'Connor" and under Alio "Alio"s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio "Alio" confirming the fake identity.)The staff should be a bit more friendly.I can understand the prices if it served better food, like some Chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area.My family and I stayed here for 3 nights March 13-16 during spring break. We did the advance purchase. We read the reviews for this hotel(due to booking error) after we booked and thought that well most of the bad reviews were last year and it seemed that they were trying to turn things around. Additionally we were not aware there were two hotels on the same street so when I initially did my research it was on the other hotel and when we finally booked it we booked for this one instead of the other in error.We payed around 99.00 a night for a room with a queen bed and a bunk bed for our two kids. The room as previous guest stated had a very musty smell. The carpet color was hard to really decipher and had several variations showing. The bathroom was very dirty. The door had chipped and cracked paint. If you looked up while running water in the sink there was a space which had an outlet and a strip that was dirt riddled. The shower curtain was filthy. The bathroom sink water ran constantly and could not be turned off. When I enquired about a resolve I was told that they would speak with the manager and call me back. We waited about 2 hours and we had to go because we had tickets to a show. When we returned the problem had not been fixed and when we called back the new person now had no knowledge of our complaint and stated that they were probably working on it and would get back to me when they returned. At the point I deemed it useless to complain about anything else as their would be no resolve. We tried to spend as less time as possible in the room. The bathtub had a chip and the tile was clearly dirty with years of caked on dirt. We wore our flip flops in the shower and my children were not permitted to walk bare foot anywhere in the room. The hair dryer was missing the wire part that covers the barrel and if you were not careful you coould burn yourself. The hair dryer was also rusted. I always bring Lysol and febreeze when I travel and a few other cleaning items. I spent a couple of hours cleaning this room since it was spring break other hotels in the area were booked. The bunk beds were unleveled and the sheets on one of the beds were dirty. Good thing I brought my own. The dishes in the kitchen area were also dirty. I would not have used them anyway. My son spilled juice on the old brown blanket that was under the comforter and it was purple and they just made the bed up and did not change it. You could clearly see there was a stain. The coffee pot was also filthy as well as the tray that everything set on. The refrigerator had an offensive odor whenever you opened it. The chairs at the table were broken and had holes. The Queen bed comforter had a holes in it and the sheets had some old black stains. The room was very small you lose space due to them putting in a bunk bed. A kitchen chair width is the distance from the queen bed to the bunk bed. the chair touched my bed and the bunk bed. So the rooms were very small. There were various types of stains on the walls, baseboards, and ceilings throughout the room. I agree with the other quest who stated not a deluxe room. The " breakfast buffet" is housed in a room that appears to be the size of one of their hotel rooms. The food on one day was powdered eggs, bacon, cereals, boiled, eggs, yogurt, coffee, pastry, toast, juice, and coffee. They had on dish of eggs and bacon they would put out for the masses of people. The lady would bring out the bacon and then go back to get the eggs by the time she came back the bacon was all gone. I also watched the same lady go and stick her hand in the trash because it was full then open the door and remove the eggs from the microwave and come out and serve them. I also watched her then change the trash then go over and fill up the cereal containers. All done without gloves. There were two ladies one wore gloves one did not. The waffle area was a nightmare. The machine was always empty and the area was a mess. It took over 1 1/2 to actually have a complete breakfast due to the way they brought out the microwave foods. I did not eat any of the pastries but some other guest were complaining that the pastry tasted stale. The overall set up has to be a health hazzard as far as how the food is prepared and served I would honestly say that there was a motel 6 and some other 1 star rated hotels that cost about 39.00 per night I would not pay $39.00 a night to stay here. I have always liked Comfort Inn and Suites but due to my stay at this one. I WILL NEVER EVER CHOSE A COMFORT INN HOTEL AGAIN. Any chain like Comfort Inn that would allow this Hotel to represent them is not a place I would stay. If I had the option of rating this hotel with a 0 star it would have received that rating. This place in the bottom of the bucket more like a motel not a hotel.I can't stand this dungeon.Way too much money for such a terrible meal.Disappointed from Calgary, AB My husband and I travelled with friends and stayed at the Ocean Sands Golf  Beach Resort from April 18th to April 25th 2006. We have stayed at all inclusive resorts in Cuba and the Mayan Rivera several times with no problems that we would bring to anyone鈥檚 attention, but we truly feel you need to be warned about this resort. CHECK IN: The trip from the airport to the hotel was quick and you didn't have the dreaded milk run to drop off people at other resorts as the van takes you right to the resort which is nice. Upon arrival check in went pretty smooth although we had requested an adjoining room which we did not get or a king bed but we were fine with what we got.ROOMS: We stayed in Villa 8, which was recommended by a lot of Trip Advisor travellers as it is close to the pool and beach and only a short walk to the buffet and main lobby. We stayed on the main level Room 8114 (main floor). Rooms were not bad, but not 5 star quality in our opinion. I really am not a picky person when it comes to traveling, I realize that we are going to other countries and some things will be out of sort, however, what I will mention will probably turn most of you away from this resort. Our friends stayed in a room beside us and it took them 4 days to come and re-set the safe so they could store their belongings. The Signature brochure showed that the mini fridge was stocked daily and we received 2 mini beer and a couple of waters the day we arrived and after that we had to pay for it. We would leave money in the fridge and they would take the money and not leave the beverages. People we hooked up with had the sofa lounger in their room infested with ants. I can handle a few ants here and there, but it was so bad they had to put the cushions out on the balcony. One night I had come back to my room and noticed that my bathroom had flooded from the ceiling. Water soaked my entire bathroom and there were sand and rocks that fell into the shower/tub. I used every towel I had to clean up the mess and thought it would be a one time occurrence but it happened a couple days later but this time the entire bathroom ceiling bowed down and exploded with water. They took the ceiling slats down and it gushed everywhere. Obviously they have plumbing issues in this hotel. We were moved to another room where we had no problems for the two days we stayed in it. We also noticed that our bedding was not changed while we stayed there until we moved into a different room. There was dirt mark at the bottom of the bed sheet and it was there for at least 5 days. Gross!!POWER OUTAGES: The first time the power went out it was around 8:00pm until 1:00am. The entire resort was pitch black as they have NO back up lighting. People were scrambling looking for their toddlers in the dark. We had to go into the al la carte restaurants and take candles off the table so we had some light and not knowing how long it would last. When the electricity goes out, so does the water. No water in the sinks, shower or toilet for several hours. We had to use our garbage can to get water from the fountains to put into the toilet tanks so we could flush. The next day the power went out again around 5:00pm when people were getting ready to shower up for dinner and again NO water. We saw people showering in the pool and one lady used conditioner in her hair and rinsed in the pool. It was gross! The power came back on a couple hours later and we didn't have any more episodes during our stay. I would bring a flashlight with you for sure. By the way......the power outage was only our resort, the others were fine.RESTAURANTS: The buffet was the best by far. There are a lot of choices and we didn't have any problems. We tried the Mexican restaurant and the food was not edible. We took one bite each and walked out and went to the buffet. The Italian restaurant was not much better but we ate a bit and then went to the buffet for some more. The restaurants are like they have all the meals pre-made and they serve it buffet style from the kitchen as you get it within 10 mins of sitting down at your table. There was one restaurant down by the beach which was pretty good, we had the beef tenderloin and we enjoyed it. BEACH/POOL: A lot of reviews stated that you needed to put a towel on your chair by 7am or you didn't get one, but we ventured out around 11am and there were always chairs at the beach or pool that you could move around to where you wanted. Keep in mind that every day people are leaving the resort and check out is 12:00 pm so you will find chairs mid morning but maybe not around 4:00pm as many people have already arrived. The pool was fine, I preferred it myself as the beach is super noisy with motor boats and helicopters constantly. At the beach they rope off the area where you can swim and it is pretty narrow. Don't go past it or you risk losing a limb to the crazy boat drivers! Lots of seaweed and they don't clean up the beach. There were plastic glasses and straws everywhere.STAFF: There was definitely more of a language barrier than in Mexico or Cuba but the staff aimed to please. They were friendly but kept to themselves or would just say they didn't understand and walk away. I am surprised that the resort allows the Royal Holiday people to stand outside the buffet and try to talk you into buying into their time shares. One couple we knew did attend the 1.5 hour session and got a free massage but they want you to drop $16,000 US on your credit card right then and there as the deposit and then pay the remainder later. We had terrible experiences every day being asked by staff members if we wanted to purchase cocaine or marijuana from them. The security guards were the worst - very persistent - Geez, would you feel safe on this resort? Overall I would give this resort a 2 out of 5 based on our experiences. Again, we have been to several all inclusive鈥檚 and never complained once and had a fantastic time. To pay over $4200 for two people plus spending money on top of that, you are better off staying at another hotel and not take the chance at this one. It's funny that Signature Vacations will not recommend certain excursions off the resort as they are not safe or worth the money in their opinion, but they still will list and recommend this resort in their travel brochure.This was our second stay with Circus Circus – despite remembering not a great stay the time before, we thought this would be more kid friendly for our two young kids, as we were passing through. We were supposed to be in town for only a day, but our car had trouble, so we ended up staying longer than the one night we expected. We had so much stuff between the four of us, and with our car in the shop in a strange city, I thought moving to a better hotel would be more of a hassle than just toughing it out. VERY BAD - our non-smoking rooms reeked of cigarette smoke, and the shower curtain in one of the bathrooms was so heavily laden with smoke we had to remove it – when we did, we noticed heavy black mold under the shower curtain rings – the ceiling to the bathrooms had mold collecting and the showers were also full of black mold. The fan in the bathroom was broken. When we thought we’d only be there one night, I thought it was something I could live with, but…. The beds were worse than pull-out beds, with metal springs that poked through and hurt my knees and body – just awful. I had to layer blankets I brought from home on the beds, just to not hurt myself on the springs. There was the smell of vomit in the hallways, and the walls were so thin, we had to turn up our TV to drown out the people next door – when we turned up our TV to drown out the adjacent room and hallway sounds, security knocked on our door to tell us to turn down our TV! When we ordered pay movies, they would play for about ten minutes, and then the screen turned blue, and that was that. When I called the front desk to report it, we were told to turn the TV off and then try again. When the same thing happened, we ended up double charged for the movies. We were offered a credit for the movies over the phone, but the credit was not reflected on our bill. When I complained about that, the front desk insisted that engineering come to our room to verify the problem before giving credit, and I told them the night they said this to me that it was already too late at night and I was putting my family to bed – engineering came over anyway at almost midnight. When I complained that we didn’t receive credit back for the movies that went blank, despite engineering at our door, I was asked who told me I would get a credit, and when I couldn’t remember the name, was essentially accused of lying, and treated pretty badly. We had two adjoining rooms, and the hotel applies a $59 deposit to each room for incidentals. When we returned to our room at night after dinner, security was there and locked us out of one room, but not the other, saying we didn’t have anymore credit left on one of the rooms because of the movies that were ordered and calls made, and we had to go to the lobby at 11 PM at night to put down another deposit, even thought the other room still had the full portion of unused credit, and we were never credited back for the movies that didn’t work. When I said we never made calls, I was told they charged a mandatory fee per day for local calls, whether you make calls or not. The next morning, we spent over an hour being passed around to different people, trying to get the movie charges reversed and the problems rectified, and someone eventually, reluctantly gave in. The refrigerator froze our food. The internet is $10 for 15 minutes, and in a hole- in- the-wall room, with a really rude attendant. I went to use the internet there to try and find another place to stay, and a rental car, but after my 15 minutes were over, again thought the hassle of moving would do more harm than good, thinking we would only be there one more night and could get through it. When we needed to rent a car, the Dollar Car Rental at the hotel said they had one car left, which was tiny and with crank down windows, for which they charged us almost $100 per day, and told us there would be both an early return fee if we brought it back early as well as their late return fee! They said if there was any accident that we not only would be responsible for the repairs, but would also have to keep renting the car everyday until it was fixed. Luckily, I only keep that car one day with no accident, and then after using the internet for another $10-15 minutes, found another car from Enterprise – a real car – for $30 per day with no early return fee! When we found we had to stay longer until our car was repaired, the front desk wanted to jack up the price to almost double what we had originally paid – when I went to the supervisor, Manish, he was very nice and agreed to renew our stay at the originally quoted price – he was the only person at the hotel who seemed to care and was really nice – everyone else treated us like criminals. We ate at the buffet once – over $50 for lunch for a family of 4 - while some of the desserts were pretty good and the salad bar was fresh, most of the main dishes were really bad, and I spit out several things into my napkin because they were that awful. They did have a really nice area for the KOA campground folks next to the hotel, which I found while looking to do some laundry. The KOA campground facilities were better than the facilities for regular hotel guests!!! Although I never camped before, I was wishing I was there instead of the actual hotel. Even though the KOA facilities were nice, the laundry room left some of my clothes in worse condition than before I washed them, and I ended up rewashing by hand some of our clothes back at the room. While I am sure the room would be passable for a one night, no expectations stay, there were just too many issues and problems for me to ever recommend the hotel to others, or ever plan on returning again.Our rooms: When I first got to my room, everything seemed ok. However, when I tried to use the phone to call my brothers in their room, I discovered that I couldn’t dial out. When the phone was replaced, I could mostly dial out, but the entire phone would occasionally go completely dead and I wouldn’t be able to dial out OR receive incoming phone calls. Quite a few times my brothers or my friends said “I called about 10 minutes ago. Why didn’t you answer the phone?” I had to explain that the phone didn’t ring. Our TV was ok for the first 5 minutes when you turned it on, but when it began to warm up, it began making this incredibly annoying buzzing sound that made it virtually impossible to watch. I called twice about this problem and twice a repair man came and fiddled around with the wires in the back and declared it fixed. It was never fixed. Our air conditioning was nice and cool during the day when we weren’t in the room for most of the day, but at night when we wanted to sleep comfortably in cool air, the air conditioning went down to being almost off and we woke up covered in sweat. It must have been on some kind of a timer, because the air conditioning came back on again at 8am each morning like clockwork. I reported this twice to the manager on duty and nothing was ever done. I’ve never had this happen to me before in a resort, and this was my third time to Mexico and my 10th time to the Caribbean. If I had known right away that we were going to have these problems, I would have requested a new room. However, as one of my friends stated who was on the trip and had a horrible time with the musty smell in her room (ours was musty too, but it didn’t bother me as much as the other problems), she was afraid she would get moved to a room with worse problems. My brothers discovered right away when they went to their room at the beginning of the week that their air conditioning didn’t work and they had dead ants all over the floor. They were moved to another room in a different building and they didn’t have too many problems the remainder of the week. My one friend had the horrible musty smell and my other friend had an unreliable phone and he discovered a huge cockroach crawling up his wall. I talked to a few people on the tram to breakfast one day and they said they had an iguana and his/her family living in their wall. They were seen outside of the wall a few times, but mostly they could hear them moving around inside the wall. They asked for another room but were told that none were available. We were told that only 20% of the resort was occupied, so many of the buildings must have been closed and they weren’t going to open them for people with problems. Food and Drinks: The food was pretty horrible, except for the buffets which were average. At the specialty restaurants for dinner, service was so slow that we missed the shows. The buffet had better food and you served yourself, so you could get out in time to see the nightly entertainment. We were allowed to go to four specialty restaurants since we were there for seven nights, but we quit after the second one. The food just wasn’t worth the wait. I didn’t care for most of the drinks we ordered at various bars around the property. The pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris tasted like they came from a mix and they had very little alcohol. The White Russians were NOT made with Kahula (which is dirt cheap in Mexico since it’s MADE in Mexico, for God’s sake!!!), but with some cheaper coffee liqueur. Yuck. Pools and Beach: The pools were nice, but on a few days the water was so warm that it wasn’t even refreshing. The beach was so far away from our rooms that we spent more time at the pools. The beach is also on an inlet, so you can’t even see the wide open ocean when you’re in the water. You just feel like you’re in a salt water pool. In Cancun, we had an infinity pool that was right next to the ocean, so if you were in the pool or at the beach, you could see the ocean as far as you looked. You really felt like you were at the ocean. Entertainment: Other than the two shows they had which consisted of them taking people out of the audience for a game show (which were both lame), the shows were the best I’d seen at any resort. They had a Broadway night, a Las Vegas night, a Movie theme songs night and a few other really good ones while we were there. The shows had lots of excellent dancing and beautiful costumes. The choreography was excellent and I was amazed at how talented the dancers were. I really enjoyed all of these types of shows. Activities: It was very hot so we never participated in the volleyball games, archery, or tennis. However, they did have a fun club where you could get tubes for the pool and participate in pool games. There were some nice shops on the property that sold souvenirs, jewelry, and liquor. The Xcaret park, next door to our resort, was excellent. We got the tickets for $40 instead of $67 because we were staying at the Xcaret resort. We swam in the underground river at the park and saw the show at night, which were both excellent. The park is huge and there is a lot to do and see. I highly recommend it. Time share/Royal Club sales people: They hounded us everywhere we went. They were worse than the sales people at the airport. Olympus and Apple Tours sales people weren't much better. They were more annoying here than anywhere I've stayed before. Overall recommendation: Don’t go to this resort. I wouldn’t recommend it.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.There was a heat problem to boot, so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats!Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

My wife and I stayed at the Ocean Bavaro resort with several friends in Punta Cana, D.R. from 08 OCT 2006 to 15 OCT 2006 as booked through Apple Vacations.Although the resort grounds themselves were quite nicely cared for, the service offered there didn't measure up nearly as well. There were several problems that truly effected the quality of our experience:1. Several members of our group experienced the loss of their luggage AFTER it had been delivered to the curbside of the main lobby of the resort. It ended up in Santo Domingo and was not returned until the following day. Fortunately, there was no loss of property but, needless to say, the members of our group were NOT impressed by the inconvenience this caused them and the discomfort resulting from the inablilty to obtain their medications as needed.2. Upon our arrival at 11:00 a.m., we were advised that our rooms would not be available to us until after 3:00 p.m. and that we would have to wait in the lobby until such time that they were ready. At the end of our 4+ hour wait (during which the luggage came up missing as described above) we were told that there was going to be another 'slight delay' as our rooms were still not ready. When after 30 minutes had passed, we were finally shown to our rooms, we experienced several problems that caused more delays and cost us more of our time. These delays were: sending one of our group to a room already ocuppied by other guests, several members of our group found their room air conditioning units to either completely non-functional or malfunctioning severely and dumping large quatities of water upon the floor as a result, and one of the rooms had suffered such extreme water damage to the ceiling that several cracks in the ceiling could be seen emanating in many directions and seemed to be ready to fail structurally.3. Several of the staff demonstrated a less than helpful attitude in that; when addressed in English claimed not to know English and when addressed in Spanish by one of our group in that language would then pretend not to comprehend that language either until a stern tone and aggressive posture was taken with them. When this occurred, they then seemed to recall their comprehension of either language (Spanish or English) that suited them and things proceeded along until the next contact with staff that again mandated a reassertion of the above method with the offending staff. This became quite annoying (and tiring) after it persisted for the first three days and became a sore point for all of us in that we spent so much time dealing with such a resistive staff.4. Additionally, we were all subjected to a never-ending, high pressure sales pitch from Amstar staff on-site to go view a time-share facility nearby. The Amstar staff present on the resort would constantly approach us with an aggressive demand that we go on a bus ride to the time-share facility in exchange for some free merchandise of low value and after being told no several times, eventually in an angry tone as a result of all the badgering, would then re-approach us again if we returned to the lobby area even as little as ten minutes later. We would then be subjected again to the same strenuous, badgering that we had just endured as if it had never happened minutes prior to this. This remained a problem throughout the duration of our 7 day stay at the resort and generated animosity in many of our group or the uncomfortable situation that it had become. I approached the resort staff on more than one occasion about this issue and was dismissed without resolution of the problem. This issue alone was enough to ensure that I will never, ever return to this resort as I feel that there are better things to do with my vacation time than fend off overly aggressive salesmen with, Don't take 'no' for an answer sales tactics. That they would proceed to follow us about the resort attempting to argue that we should just go for a 'leetle' bus ride after ebing told 'no' repeatedly and often angrily due to our frustration at these repeated assaults, approached the obscenely ludicrous.5. Finally, the aggressive sales pitch tactics were also used by several of the resort staff during our meals in that we were often pressured to buy bottles of wine and other items while dining and being served wine with our meal and such were offered at ridiculously high prices, an obvious attempted to fleece us for a few more dollars. The food quality was unpalatable at best and inedible at the worst and the buffet area was frequented by various types of birds that tended to roost in the rafters above the food with unsanitary, albeit predictable results.6. Guest behavior at this resort also proved to be an issue as on several occasions when my wife and I would decide to get into the pool or the ocean for a brief time we would return to our chairs to find our articles that we had placed on our chairs in our absence, cast upon the ground and kicked out of the way. In one particular instance we returned to find our chairs taken over in such a manner by a hispanic female in her 30's and her children who was in the process of using my chair as a changing table for her infant who had soiled his diaper in a rather 'large' way and was not being very careful with where the fecal matter ended up. She acted as if she didn't realize that she had done wrong but there was no way that she could not have known that someone was using the chairs because she had to have moved quite a bit of our personal belongings in order to use the chairs.Despite this egregious behavior by the staff, we found that they always had a hand out for a tip, despite that we were told that this was an all-inclusive resort and soliciting tips was not permitted.Be warned !!! Stay away from Ocean Bavaro resort via Apple Vacations in Punta Cana, D.R. Apple rated it 'four apples' and they are all rotten !!! I just wish that I could get my time back so that I could go somewhere else and actualy enjoy my vacation.As I was searching a hotel to stay for a weekend visit back to San Francisco, I came cross to this hotel which is managed by Shell Hospitality and considered as a "resort" in the company's standard. It is an all suite property right off Civic Center, War Memorial Opera House and Symphony Hall in the posh Hayes Valley area. Welcome area and lounge area are decorated in classic tone and completely charming boutique feel from the beginning of the boutique hotel booms in the industry. The first staff I encountered at Front Desk was not uniformed when I arrived at a quarter past 1PM (a bit early for check-in but it was Sunday and the city is running lower occupancy in hotel industry, so I thought I could give it a try). Of course, the room/suite was not ready. I stored my belongings with the hotel and off my errands in the city. I was told that the room would be ready by 3PM. I returned to the hotel around 3:30PM and was given room 35 after 10 minutes wait by the Front Desk to get someone to acknowledge me. I got the key within one minute and off I went to the classic SF apartment cozy elevator. As I got off the elevator, I almost hit the robe (not sure if it is clean or not), hanging by the door that enters to the wing my room located. I carefully walk around it in the Hotel’s narrow hallway. It indeed reminds me a bit like many of the city sponsored apartment buildings around SF, except the price tag for this hotel was way much higher. As I walked past an opened door with housekeeper inside to get to my room, I knew that my room would not be ready (this came from my experience working in Sales & Marketing department in a two major hotel chains in US for 10 years). The bed was not done and the room had a really bad odor. I turned around and went back to the Front Desk. This time, I was noticed right away. I informed the staff that the room given to me was not ready. They radioed the housekeeping department and I was told that the room was ready after they got the confirmation from housekeeping. I told the FD staff that the bed was not made so it could not possibly be clean and ready. One of the FD staff went into the office behind the desk and later I was given another room - Room 55 on 5th floor. This time I did not encounter the dirty linen hanging from the door and did not notice any housekeepers on this floor. I got into the STUDIO and was really shocked. The kitchenette area was efficiently in front of the door. To the right, there was the bed that I would be crashed for the 2 nights. There was no working area or desk. The tiny night stand houses an old lamp, the house phone, standard hotel radio/alarm and a pile of magazines/hotel information directory (I gathered as I did not want to get more shocks with the 3.5 star hotel accommodations). The armoire right in front of the bed has a VCR-TV combo, few drawers and hangers. There was no safe deposit that could be found as most 2-5 star hotels would have across US. The iron and iron board are tugged away next to the armoire and the mirror wall (YES, the mirror wall that can be found in some road-side motels often with a big billboard offering honeymoon suite by the hour!) On the other side of the bed is a classic armed-chair sits between the window (going out to the fire escape) leaving a bit of room for me to walk by. The studio is really tiny comparing to most hotel rooms I have seen in San Francisco (one of the hotel chains I worked was in the city) but this room is to suppose to be a STUDIO and the hotel names itself as a 3.5 star resort. I was truly disappointed but I told myself to make do since I am only staying two nights. I tried to put away my suitcase and all my belongings since there was not much room to walk around in the bedroom area. The armoire can’t be opened all the way and hit the end of the bed when opens to 60 degree so I carefully tugged my bag in the armoire as well as the portable heater it was left in my room. The bathroom was decent size comparing to my sleeping quarter but I would only consider it was efficient not luxurious or nicely decorated. It does appear to be clean and everything seems to all attached, however, the rose color shower curtain stands way out in this all ivory/creamy colored bathroom. I looked again in the hotel’s website and made sure that I was not making any mistakes on my research before booking the hotel. I found there is some rooms in the hotel SMALLER than mine, called Ballet Room for efficiency travelers (I however had hard-time to image any room smaller than mine). For my type of studio, it supposes to have two chairs and a desk or table according to the hotel’s website. I told myself that there is no way, the hotel can even try to put in another chair or a desk/table and still advertises this studio as comfortable for two people. I pulled over a pillow as my desk on the bed and sat on the one and only chair to make it work as working area. The resort/hotel is not deserved 3.5 star as I have seen 2.5 and 3 star hotel in the city that are more spacious, clean and well dècored. I don’t know how the hotel pulled together to get the star rating from AAA and passed the standards as required. Shell Hospitality managed a few great resorts so I was really disappointed that this hotel can be part of Shell’s world of elegant resorts and vacation homes. The rate for the studio was low but I know that I can get some other hotels with less star rating but more comfortable setting for travelers. My back was getting stiff just to sit on the chair and work on the laptop for one hour, a business traveler definitely would not be able to use this property for the business trip.My girlfriend and I had the misfortune to experience an horrible stay at the H10 Marina Barcelona from November 25th to November 30th. I went to Barcelona for work and my girlfriend joined me 2 days afterwards to celebrate the first anniversary of our relationship, an anniversary that we will surely remember even though not in the positive way we had hoped for. The Hotel is not up to four-star standard. Although the staff was for the whole period of the stay very kind and professional, the facilities are to say the least very lacking and made our stay a complete nightmare. I work as a junior researcher while my girlfriend is a flight attendant. We are therefore used to constantly travel for work and have been in any kind of hotels all around the world. It was however the first time in our life we had such a terrible experience, having to change the room for four times in just five days! I will hereby shortly describe the problems which occurred during our stay. On the first day, I arrived late in the evening and was given a standard double room. While checking the room, I noticed there was quite a lot of dust under the bed, but did not complain because overall the room seemed ok, though quite cold. I therefore turned the heating on and went to sleep. During the night the room became colder and colder, and to my great displeasure I understood that the heating was in fact not working at all. I spent a night freezing, covered in all the blankets and quilts I could find in the room. The morning after, just before leaving for work, I informed the front desk of the problem and I was informed they would be giving me another room. When I came back in the afternoon, I re-packed the entire luggage I had just un-packed the evening before and moved to the new room. To my great disappointment I noticed that the room I moved into was in the corner of the building and therefore considerably smaller than the previous one and with only a small window while my previous room had a whole wall with windows. I am sure you will understand that, after spending a sleepless night in the cold in a four-star hotel the last thing I was expecting was a room down-grading. I informed the front-desk about the situation but was told that it was the only available room at the moment and that, even if clearly smaller, the room was still in the same room category as the previous room. I was then given the opportunity to move to a junior suite. Of course, the difference in room rates would be charged on my account. But since I was waiting for my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary I decided to take the junior suite and just pay the difference. During the first night in the junior suite I understood that the hotel had problems with the central heating apparatus and not only with the heating in my previous room, and I spent another night sleeping in the cold. The next morning, while on the elevator, I discussed with other guests of the hotel who confirmed the heating was lacking in other rooms as well. This was confirmed by the front-desk staff –and I wonder why I wasn’t informed of this when I asked to change the room in the first place – but was assured the problem would be solved. Later that evening my girlfriend arrived and to our great pleasure the heating did as well. The junior suite room was, except for the heating system, in order and comfortable. On a side note, it was quite worrisome to notice that the electric panel behind the bathroom door was lacking its plastic cover and was exposed (room 911). The day after, while I was working, my girlfriend informed me there were other problems with the room. In fact our junior suite on the 9th floor was invaded by ants! She called the manager, who at first blamed us saying that it would be normal to have ants in our room since we had brought in food. We had indeed brought some tangerines, but the explanation did not seem very plausible to us; we usually have food in our homes in Switzerland, but this does not mean we all have ants at home. And we were in November. We were then once again moved to another room, this time a junior suite with balcony. Just after moving there, my girlfriend noticed there was water on the floor near the wall dividing the bathtub from the room. There was a water leak and water poured into the room. The manager sent a plumber to fix the leak and we were moved to another junior suite with balcony. The last junior suite with balcony indeed had a balcony. But this was flooded. The drain did not work and the balcony could not be used. The furniture inside the room was in bad shape. For example the mini-fridge’s cupboard door did not close and the wainscots where all damaged and falling out. The water temperature in the shower kept on changing from freezing cold to boiling hot. We informed the front desk of this last point but nothing was done. But these were all minor problems compared to what we had been through to this point – though one would not expect this from a suite in a four-star hotel – and so we decided not to complain anymore and tried to enjoy, however possible, the rest of our short holidays. The last misadventures of our stay were that our room keys stopped working two days in a row (we were in room 804 at the moment the problem arose. We discovered that the guest staying in room 802 on Friday had the same problem with room keys which just quit working all of a sudden). And on the day of our leave, we discovered that we had been debited nearly 60 euro of expenses at the bar – were we had never been – on the 25th. We contested the debit and asked to see the receipt, which was not found and in the end the sum was taken out of our account. In conclusion, our stay at your hotel became a real nightmare. I want to underline once again that the staff was always very kind and professional (although they don’t seem very keen on answering e-mails – I had asked to confirm if there would be any rate changes since I would be using the double room as single occupancy during the first 2 days and never got an answer; nor very flexible – we asked for a salad or sandwich through room service at 23.15 and were informed that would be impossible since room service ended at 23.00). But in general our experience in your hotel was really below that of a four-star standard. During our stay we took pictures to document the various problems described above which we will post on this website NOTE: I wrote to the customer care afterwards. They apologized deeply and said they would offer us a free stay. I contacted them about the free stay three times during the past month. They never answered a single e-mail of mine.However, the service is absolutely horrible.It is bland and nothing extrodinary.I was in Vegas in December 2010 for an industry conference being held at Caesar's conference center. I was offered a room at the hotel at a good "conference" rate and was pretty excited to be able to stay at Caesars - "oh, that will be really nice, Caesar's is one of the more upscale of the hotel/casinos in Vegas" everyone told me. Wow, what a miserable experience. After a 10-hour day of sightseeing/scenic driving on the way back to Vegas for my conference (I flew to Vegas from the east coast but had rented a car to do a bunch of sightseeing for a few days in Utah at Zion/Bryce/Capitol Reef) I tried to figure out where to park to check-in for Caesars and did nothing except upset the valets and taxis who shooed me "you can't stop here go park." So I had to go park in the big garage, walk approx. 8-10 minutes through two casino floors (and beg for directions from some casino floor worker through the meandering maze with vague wayfinding posts) to find my way from self-park to the registration desk. When I asked the woman at registration if there was a place to stop to unload my bags first and then go self-park she looked at me like I had three heads and snarled, "no, there's the valet but there's, like, no, there's no place to just park so you can drop off your bags, no. The bellman will help you with your bags." So I checking in was about a 45-50 minute ordeal walking back and forth to the car three times: car --> registration --> car --> hotel room with one heavy bag --> car --> hotel room with heavy bag #2, each time walking probably 1/3 mile. The Bell Desk had such a long line it would have been useless and I have to say that the entire 4 days I was there I never once saw a bellman helping a single guest with bags. I did notice later in the week many other poor, sad, tired, lost-looking folks dragging huge suitcases across the smoky, meandering casinos. They put me in the Roman Tower - which I later figured out from reviews here is one of the two dumpiest towers. Wish I had checked TripAdvisor ahead of time. My room hadn't been renovated in at least 15-20 years. Everything was old, banged up, cracked, the door rim on the bathroom door was falling off. Both beds were so old they had a dip in them and I could feel the springs. I ended up stripping the one bed and rotating and flipping the mattress to a side that was less worn so I could sleep. The one thing that I thought would redeem the room - the jetted tub - blew pieces of dark greenish mold into the tub when activated! Disgusting! I lept out of the tub dripping wet and nearly screaming. Truly vile. I had to call housekeeping to clean the tub and I was pretty skeeved taking a shower. The TV was ancient and picture was terrible. I know you're not supposed to be in your room watching TV in Vegas, but I wanted to unwind with it a couple of nights... and as you'll read if you search other reviews, there were adjoining doors to both sides and I could everything going on next to me. Finally, I understand perhaps no fridge or microwave but no coffeemaker? Seriously? I count on having a cup brewing while I'm in the shower. (I ended up going out to get some Starbucks Via and using the super hot water from the tap to make coffee the remaining mornings a mug I had with me.) Everything in Caesar's is overpriced. Thank goodness my company was paying. I also got hit with the "would you like to upgrade to an XYZ fancier room?" on check-in (umm, no, I'm here on the conference rate - a.k.a. my company is paying and they're not gonna approve an upgrade.) The "would you like to upgrade..." went on for four days straight. I couldn't request a wake-up call without having the operator ask me if I'd like to place a room service breakfast order. $15/day for internet. $20-something to use the fitness center... Caesar's nickel and dimes you at every turn. When I tried to ask the hostess at Beijing Noodle 9 for some suggestions from the menu, she acted like it was a big inconvenience, confused me into asking a dumb question (that I was pretty sure was a dumb question but she was the one making no sense), then went over to place my order and I noticed her talking to the cook and he was looking at me and laughing. After my horrible check-in experience and horrible experience at Beijing Noodle, I made sure that all of my discretionary spending on meals, gambling and entertainment went elsewhere - mostly the MGM Grand, and TI (where I took in Mystere and Ka) and New York, New York. I ended my stay at Caesars a day early (an extra day I was staying to sightsee on my own dime) to find something nicer and cheaper (half price!) for one night. I've been to Vegas before and stayed at Luxor, which was a great experience, and the Sahara, which despite being one of the cheaper strip establishments was still a better experience than Caesars. Unless you are a high-rolling VIP with money to burn stay away from Caesars. They ripped off my company for $149/night on a piece of crap room and when I later did some research I found out I could have gotten a nice deal at many of the other strip hotels for half that -- Luxor, MGM, Mirage, Monte Carlo etc. are all offering good deals to get your business -- and I would have probably had a better experience. Caesars treats their conference goers (and probably all the other everyday folks not paying their prime rates) like crap which is a shame because I was excited to be there and willing to spend my own personal money there shopping, eating and playing slots if they had treated me with a little more dignity.Billed as a family friendly resort, we chose Paradise Point as the place to stay when we took our 3 year old to San Diego for his first family vacation. Placing our reservations a month in advance, I decided to splurge and reserve the bay view junior suite. We arrive with an exhausted, nap-ready kid at 2PM; we were told that our room was not ready yet, we're given pool keys, and told that we could visit any of the resort's pools while we wait. I ask for our room # so that I we could park and visit the pool closest to our room... we're told that they could not disclose our room #. Huh? Things got worse from there. At 3:30, we were given the go ahead to check in. We picked up our room keys, opened the door, and discovered that we had been given a garden view suite, not the bay view I had reserved. Strike 2. Going to the front desk and requesting a new room at this point is untenable...our child is exhausted...we decide to speak with the front desk the next day. That night, after the boy went to sleep, my wife and I decide to enjoy a glass of wine and some quiet time. We discover that we're not alone...another tenant, a 2 inch long cockroach is sauntering across the floor. This roach was so big, that I could have either smashed him with a shoe or put a leash around him...he does go very well with the three spiders in the ceiling. Strike 3. The roach successfully dispatched, our wine drank, we decide to call it a night...did I mention that we had to go to the store to buy plastic cups to drink our wine because the wet bar in our suite had no cups, no plates, no silverware, nothing? We crawl into bed and discover a blood stain on our duvet. It's not an OJ Simpson sized blood stain, but large enough that the maid should have caught it...we feel the benefit of the doubt slowly shrinking away. Morning. Surprised the coffee maker works, I have my morning cup and climb into the shower. When I get out, I reach for a towel to dry myself only to discover that it is as soft as a roofing tile. Seriously some free beach towels we got at dodger stadium that we use to dry our dog are soft as silk compared with ones. After a big day we return during naptime (1:30 PM) only to discover that the maid hasn't made up our room yet...so, off to the pool we go while we wait for housekeeping. Strike #?? I've lost count. My lovely bride stays with the boy (and her cocktail) at the pool while I visit the front desk to discuss my first day at PP. The guy at the front desk promises the maid will be earlier tomorrow, to report the insect infestation, and that the OJ duvet will be replaced. And the bayview room? He tells me that we got a free UPGRADE from a Bayview Junior Suite to a Garden View Suite. How thoughtful. It would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted this generous upgrade. Day 3. The towels are still exfoliating me, housekeeping had finished by the time we returned from Seaworld, and no signs of any other 6 or 8 leg co-tenants...maybe they're turning this thing around? Fat chance. That night we ordered an early dinner so we would have time to make smores at the fire pit in the main pool area with our son. We arrive at the fire pit at 7:30 PM. No fire. A couple sitting nearby tell us that they have already put in a request to have the fire lit. Not taking any chances I go to the front desk. The woman behind the desk tells me that she'll "put in a request for the service." When I ask her what that means, she tells me that she punches in the request in the computer which will cause someone to show up "soon." Not very reassuring. 7:45 PM. No fire. I return to the front desk. This time there are three parties ahead of me checking in. The woman at the front desk knows why I'm there, but she pretends she doesn't see me to make me wait. When I get to the front of the line, she explains that she doesn't know why the fire hasn't been lit yet. I suggest, impatiently, that perhaps she should pick up the phone and call someone. Her manager beckons me, promises she'll have someone there right away. 8:15 PM. Still no fire. My son is doing his best at waiting patiently for smores. I am no longer patient. So I bring him and his marshmallow laden stick to the front desk. The women there still have no answer for the delay, and seemingly no empathy for my problem. Exasperated, on my way out, I tell them to "light the damn fire pit." The manager behind the front desk threatens to evict me. Unreal. 8:30 PM. We talk with a security guard walking through the main pool area. He gets on his radio. The fire pit is lit within five minutes. Was that so hard? 10:00 PM. We decide to crawl into bed for our final night at the hotel. We pull down the sheets and see the familiar blood stain on the bedspread. Well, I guess I cannot complain lest my evicted family has to spend the night in our car.Since we go to WDW every December we decided to go the Grand Floridian this December for our 40th anniversary. We booked the honeymoon room which is located on second floor of Main Building. I've heard many negatives reports but thought sour grapes. So off we went Dec 4th. Got at the resort at 9:30am & was taken up to 3rd floor to check in. The person was very nice & said he would have room ready as soon as previous guests checked out at 11am. So we went over to MK, had lunch, rode some rides. Then we called at 1:30pm and he said it was ready. We headed back over & no room. He said he would see when next room would be ready. He came back & said 15 minutes just relax & have something to drink. So far okay. After an hour no room. Another person asked if we needed anything, we said we were waiting for our room. He checked & said one was ready. The concierge manager took us to our room. He asked if there was a special event that brought us to the GF we said yes & told him. After relaxing we went to the Christmas Party & came back around 9pm to find a platter of chocolate covered strawberries which I ordered for Monday so I thought they made a mistake. That night the noise level was way too loud but we over looked it. I mentioned to the person I ordered the strawberries that they brought it to us a day early & to cancel that night's she said she would call. (We saw the manager who asked if we liked the strawberries he gave us on the house? I said yes but he should have put that in the note.) That night more strawberries. Ok, she did say she would take them off bill. Ha! That night noise was louder than before called down to front desk since it was after 10pm & said they would check into it. It got worse between midnight until 4:30am, sounded like they were doing work on the building. Also TV didn't work, hair dryer didn't work. While hubby was getting ready the next day, I walked down to talk to another concierge, told him about the noise & other problems, please note there was other people complaing about contruction noises during early morning. He said he would look into it & he said he would give me a credit of half that night room rate we paid $615 plus taxes. I said I wasn't looking for that but wanted something done about the noise & other problems. He said he wanted to give some of it back. Nice touch so I thought. Later that night, more noise so I went down & talked to yet another person who came back to room & he said he didn't know what the noise was but he had another room on same floor. Okay so we changed hoping for the best & all the problems would go away. After having some dinner we came back to room, hubby said no working TV even though we tried it before we left for dinner. When trying to use toilet it didn't flush. Plus hair dryer didn't work. So we called down & reported this. He had a man up to check out toilet, he said it needed to be replaced all together, try not to use toilet paper & flush twice but to make sure it didn't over throw. This is not funny. He did replace the TV & said he would replace hair dryer the next day along with a new toilet. Andy called & said he heard what was going on & asked if we could be out of our room by 9am the next day, said yes, he said he was sorry but this too can be fixed.Oh postive side no noise. Next day, we stopped by desk to remind them about putting in new toilet & hair dryer. The guy even called while we were still there. So we thought all was okay finally. Came back around 2pm & no toilet replaced or hair dryer. And toilet didn't even work. We walked back to the desk and said what was going on? The lady was shocked that they didn't do the work. I reminded her we wasted about a total of a day with working out these problems which shouldn't have happen in the so call cream of the top resort in WDW. She called the maintaince manager who came up to our room & told us he just got yelled at by his boss & now it was our turn to yell at him. I just looked at him & said I wasn't going to yell but wanted to know why after there was a work order to do these things. (A good thing we came back as we were going to stay at MK for late closing if we did that no toilet.) He said he would replaced it & he didn't know why it wasn't. He had the two guys that was suppose to do come up. He asked them why didn't they follow instructions on a work order. All they could say we thought they would save the resort some money. I looked at them & asked if they would like to pay me what I paid for a room that didn't have a working toilet for a day & half? They said no they wouldn't like that. The manager told me it would be replaced & he would stay to make sure. After 4pm it was ready & working. We had dinner & went back to MK though we were rather in a grumpy mood over how we were being treated. To make a story short, when we checked out on Saturday morning, we wasn't given a credit even though I had the paper work. I checked over the bill & saw that they charged us for two orders of strawberries. I said I wasn't paying for something the staff gave us. He said he would take both off & give us the credit that wasn't on checkout bill even though it was in the computer. He said he was sorry that knew we had a bad week there & hoped we would give them another chance. I didn't say anything but Andy was there & knew I wouldn't come back next year with our son & his wife. We lefted saying thank goodness that is over with & hubby said he was sorry that he didn't listen to me about how much it was costing after he complained about our trip to the USVI being too much like only $2500 beachfront at the Morningstar at Frenchmen's reef. We paid over $5400 for 6 nights at the GF. A sour taste was left in my mouth Sunday when I checked my Disney Visa online & saw a $300 room charge. I called back down & talked to a front desk manager who looked it up & saw what was wrong, when they gave us a credit they didn't punch in a code therefore a charge instead of credit so I was charged twice even tough my paper work said a credit due me. He said he work take care of it & call me back. He did but said the department that handles it was closed on Sunday, he would do it first thing Monday & call me back before he left at 3pm today. No call back & when I called, he left at 1:45pm. I asked the person to have him looked into the matter that he & I talked about Sunday & call me back on Tuesday. She said she would leave a note. I think I will have better luck with Disney Visa but they said to try to work it out before I put in a dispute. Now I know some of you all loved the place, I didn't I went with open eyes & wasn't expecting so many problems, yes they tried to fix them but a little too late. I will never stay there again no matter what. I will say it is a lovely resort but they need to tend to rooms & the way they handle problems. These are my views so you might want to say thing about my report. Do so but you wasn't in our shoes and we know what we experienced.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Food portion was SMALL and below average.I called this hotel's reservations center directly and made one reservation for two adults. One confirmation was submitted to my email address; and after finding a different hotel I preferred to stay at during my visit to Orlando, I canceled my reservation through the link attached to the inital confirmation in the appropriate time I was given to avoid any charges being made to my credit card; and I was issued an cancellation number. While driving on the Florida turnpike (from Michigan) the day following the arrival date I was initally supposed to have checked in, a female from this hotel called my cell phone inquiring if I was still arriving at their hotel (sounded pretty desperate to me for business). I informed the individual that I had canceled the reservation and had a cancellation number in my email account and I was driving on the highway and that I needed to remain focused since traffic was somewhat congested. Nevertheless, she goes on to inform me that they (the hotel) didn't have a cancellation for me. I once again informed her that she was calling my cell phone while I was driving on the highway; and she goes on to inquire if I could forward the cancellation to her email address. DUH? What part of I am driving on the highway didn't she understand? I then informed her that when I arrived to where I was going, I would print the cancellation and bring it to her. She then goes on to ask me if I were in the Orlando area? DUH AGAIN! How many times had I informed her that I was driving on the highway enroute to this area? Anyways, when I arrived to the beautiful resort I elected to stay in, I was extremely exhausted being that I was the only driver in my vehicle; so, I checked in, showered and went to sleep. The following day, I had a strict schedule to adhere to and was not able to take the canceled reservation to this hotel; so, I wait until the next day, open my email and OMG, I have an email from this hotel asking me to submit to a survey for a one night stay. Huh? Immediately, I decided to check my bank account and discovered this hotel had charged me for a one night stay subsequent to me informing their representative that I had canceled the reservation; so, here comes the good part. When I arrive at the hotel with my canceled reservation, I am told that I made two reservations? Huh? Whoever I initially spoke to when making the reservation obviously has a hearing problem because I informed the reservation agent that I was making one (1) reservation for two (2) adults. Why did she list on my reservation I had a party of four (4) adults? Then, the front desk tells me that I made the reservation online. I told the woman that I did not make the reservation online, I called directly into the hotel because had I made the reservation online, I would have made it through my Gold Points account and this reservation was not in my Gold Points account; and that she could open my account to verify it. Then, she tells me that I made two reservations under the same confirmation number. If this were true, then, when I canceled the one reservation, the other reservation should have canceled also. Hmm, this seems correct to me. Okay, I was seeing how desperate they were in thinking I was going to yield to allowing them to keep money from my account that they had already fraudulently charged me for; so, I stood my grounds with informing them that I did NOT make two reservations; and they stood there toying with their system until I pulled out my cell phone and called my bank in their presence. All of sudden, the IGNORANT front desk manager tells the billing representative to refund my money because they didn't want to continue dealing with the issue. This raised a concern with both me and the representative from my bank (who heard her) and I reported the matter to the FRAUD department at my bank because it was very obvious that this hotel doubles the reservation on people who cancels their reservation as a measure of charging the customer for at least one night when the customer decides not to stay at their hotel. They stood in my face and told so many LIES, it was both pathetic and unprofessional. Had I made the reservation online, why would I list my name as Mrs. when that is not my appropriate title? Why wouldn't the reservation be listed in my Gold Points account? Why would I make a reservation for four adults when I was only traveling with my daughter? Why wouldn't I choose the AAA rate opposed to their best available rate (which is always higher)? BE CAREFUL WHEN MAKING RESERVATIONS DIRECTLY WITH THIS HOTEL BECAUSE IF YOU CHOOSE TO CANCEL, TEN TIMES OUT OF TEN, YOU'RE GOING TO BE PENALIZED FOR DECIDING NOT TO STAY AT THEIR HOTEL WHEN THERE ARE OTHER HOTELS THAT ARE MORE QUALITATIVE THAN THEIRS! I'm sure the majority of all of these GOOD REVIEWS are made by hotel employees. Nothing is perfect; and I have come to discover that this hotel actually is pitiful! I would suggest to anyone to sustain your cancellation number because if you don't, it is their word against yours and ten times out of ten, you will not get your money back. Now, this is a primary example of how businesses seek to take advantage of consumers in these extreme economic times. How pathetic! I wouldn't suggest this hotel to no one, even if they paid me to do it! UNPROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES EQUATE TO UNPROFESSIONAL BUSINESS...ATTEMPTED RIP OFF!Reading this review, please keep in mind I'm rating this place relative to the cost and the image they try to portray on their website. A bit of modesty could help this place have a reality check. This place was probably nice when it opened, but it just looks tired and dated now. The website, advertising and photography portray a false image of this property as a high end luxury resort. For the price (even though I booked on points) and cost of their restaurant, this place just doesn't cut it. I stay in all types of places in and outside of the US for business so I'm really not that picky and try not to rate a place based on age, especially if certain items are updated and they keep the property clean. However I found that this place was just worn down. The landscaping is abundant, but it was a bit unkempt, and it really showed in the pool area. There was debris, leaves, dead bugs, etc. all in the pool and hot tub. Keep in mind they charge most guests a "resort fee" to use these services. For a place that is supposed to be high end, they are slacking on keeping the place tidy. I would also appreciate knowing there was a conference going on here during our stay, and furthermore being advised by the front desk. They told me about the Veranda Restaurant which we could eat at, yet they failed to tell me that a conference had a private party on the patio, so my wife and I had to eat inside when we were looking forward to relaxing on your patio by the fireplace which you so proudly display in photos on your website. Instead we come to California and have to eat dinner inside. We came here to stay in a nice place, not feel like outsiders that are relegated to certain parts of the hotel. Forewarning of amenities not available would be a good idea up front. Its the ethical thing to do. We also would have left for dinner. Good thing we only stayed one night. In regards to Veranda, the food was "OK". It wasn't special and thus again was overpriced. For dinner for 150 bucks I could go to an abundant number of restaurants that would make this place look like Chili's. Everything was just average. Breakfast was just blah, and again overpriced. Seriously not joking, Bob Evans breakfast is just as good.. This is a common theme unfortunately with places like this, they are so pretentious that they overcharge for everything under the guise of "luxury" and hope you won't notice just how average everything is. Go have breakfast at La Valencia in La Jolla if you want to see what an expensive breakfast should taste like. They even wanted 5 bucks for half of a grapefruit. Are you kidding me? So you are charging 10 dollars for a piece of fruit? Was this grown by magic fairies in never never land? Upon checkout the front desk was clueless on my preferred hotels points booking and tried to charge me for the stay as well as the resort fee which I was told were both covered upon my check-in. She then had to call about the rate, then tried to charge again for the resort fee, I then had to explain again that it was included per the check-in person. She took care of them but was completely zoned out and unapologetic about it. NOW THE WORST PART! Awful spring laden mattress that looks like its 10 years old and sleeps like a homeless shelter. My wife and I both woke up with sore backs. It bounces like a trampoline. The pillows were also terrible. Stiff and hard. Then, to make matters worse, you have some type of pad under the bottom sheet but its only queen sized?? so it doesn't fit, bunches up and you can feel it around your feet. Then you put a top sheet over the mattress that isn't even tucked in? Seriouisly the mattrress was exposed!! You don't even have a fitted sheet or a washable matress pad? Disgusting.. You can't have a quality resort and try to pretend its a relaxing place with beds this crappy. I just couldn't believe it. All we could do is laugh because it was so bad. And I travel about 33% of the year for business. I'm really not that picky normally, but this is supposed to be a high end place. I've stayed in Comfort Inn's with better beds than this. Hampton Inn's have more consistent bedding, perhaps your management team should stay in a Hampton to learn a bit about a decent bed, and Hampton isn't even close to luxury. At the least it would be an upgrade. Looking at other reviews, I'm not the first to mention it. For this alone I give this place 1 Star and would never go back. If you have to make a list of the top five things essential to a relaxing hotel, you have to include a nice bed. Guests should wake up feeling refreshed and revived, not with aching backs. My wife and I were even joking that they probably have bad beds to drive more business to the Spa for a massage! If the beds were decent I would have gave it three stars. Would never return or recommend to others.But make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet.Unsafe, fights, theft, poor management. I would not recommend this resort to women, families with kids or elderly. It is an Unsafe, disorganized and poorly managed resort.My husband and I traveled to Punta Cana, Bavaro Iberostar Hotel and Resort for our first anniversary in Aug 2008. My parents, bother-in-law and his wife joined us as well. This was my second time in Punta Cana, but first time at Bavaro Iberostar in Punta Cana. We had been to other Iberostar hotels in Mexico before and liked it a lot.The lobby and appearance of the resort is nice like most Iberostars, so we were very excited when we arrived at the hotel after an exhausting flight from Los Angeles. To our disappointment, this hotel was managed very poorly: We encountered two major problems: Poor Service and more importantly poor Security!The front desk (check-In) was a disaster: We were not greeted or acknowledged. They had misplaced our reservation records and it took them 3 hours to find our names in their system just to tell us our rooms which had been assigned to us originally, were sold to other guests just last week and there were no more rooms available at the resort for the first 4 nights of our one week stay! Please note that since we travel frequently to different destinations around the world, we do our homework before the trip. We had called and double checked our reservation directly with the hotel staff before departing LA. We also had a copy of my credit card bill reflecting hotel charges (paid in full for 6 people, 3 ocean view suites, 8 nights) and the reservation detail confirmation email with us handy! They had simply sold many more rooms than they had available. They told us we would have to transfer/downgrade to a much cheaper neighboring hotel/resort for the first 4 nights and they will accommodate us starting the 5th night of our stay. We also had to pay for the new resort/hotel stay!!!! Naturally we declined their offer!In the end, after arguing back and forth, they miraculously found 3 rooms at our resort (Bavaro) for us. But the room type was not what we had paid for. These were cheaper, smaller rooms with no view! We had no other option but to accept it and move on.As of today, They have not yet reimbursed us the difference!They did smile and apologized in the end and promised they would make it up to us during our stay. They also said they would send 3 fruit baskets to our rooms as apology gift. You can probably guess that we never received anything! The problem was not the missing records, but that No one cared enough to take charge to try to resolve the problem. They kept us standing for 3 hours at front desk, thirsty, hot and exhausted and nervous. We asked for at least water to drink and they kept saying Sure, we have phoned the bar and they will bring you some water in a minute!, but it never arrived. All the check in troubles aside, the major problem is the SECURITY in this resort:Before I go into details, please note that no locals were involved in any of the incident and all the troublemaker were among hotel guests/ tourists. Also, the local police/judge were extremely professional and helpful. There were fist fights over chairs next to the pool and towels almost regularly. The security staff did too little to supervise or break the fights. As if their only job was to just hang out, dance and joke with guests and nothing more! The incidents were too frequent and too violent to ignore. My husband and I personally witnessed two incidents of violence attacks (One against a young lady) and one theft which ended in violence, all in front of security staff right at the pool side in the middle of the day. My husband, I and my brother in law brought them up to the manager's attention at different points of time. We decided to report it to local police, since management refused to take any reports on anything regarding security. The general manager tried to stop us from reporting to the police. He tried to stop us from calling the police by refusing to give us the local law enforcement contact numbers. The general manager simply put it this way: If the police gets involved, it will hurt my Hotel reputation! We took it in our own hands with some other guests (two nice couples from Latin America and one from Europe) and rented a car to the closest police station to report the situation at the resort. We were received by the local Judge after an hour wait. She heard our case and ordered the police to check on the situation in the hotel and investigate/question the hotel security staff about the management cover ups. She mentioned the tourists' security is a priority in Punta Cana due to the scale of Tourism Industry in that region. Police forces showed up at the hotel quickly to talk to the hotel staff and guest regarding the cover ups of violence and theft cases. The manager had to listen and take the guests complaints seriously this time!After arresting a few guests and interviewing witnesses who came forward, the judge ordered one group of guests immediate deportation from the resort which was enforced by police the next morning!We could not wait to get out of there, thank god we are home safe and sound. Let me repeat 2 important notes in the end:First, All of the criminals were among tourists, not locals.Secondly, The action of Punta Cana Law enforcement and judge was very quick, professional and efficient.They really take tourism security very seriously. We will definitely go back to beautiful and peaceful Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Though we would not go back to Bavaro Iberostar.I would not recommend this particular resort to women, families, or elderly. It is an Unsafe, disorganized and poorly managed resort.We live on the Island of Puerto Rico, 30 minutes from the ESJ Towers. Our air conditioner broke and we needed to find a place to stay at 2:30am, we called the ESJ Towers and the clerk told us, "We have plenty of rooms available, we also have plenty of ocean view rooms available". We got there, I am handicapped and they had NOT ONE HANDICAPPED PARKING AVAILABLE!!! I was told I could park the car in the "No Parking" spot and walk in the rain to the hotel and they would make sure it wasn't towed away (is it even legal to have no handicapped parking?). I made my way to the front desk, asked the clerk for an ocean view room, he said he had one on the third floor, he advised me of the no smoking policy and I had to sign a paper that the entire hotel is no smoking (not a problem as I don't smoke), I paid and proceeded to go to my room. I opened the door to the smell of cat urine, gagging, I made my way to the balcony and noticed we were not in an ocean view room, the only "view" we had was of the dumpsters from the back of a different building, the smell was atrocious! I called the front desk and told them it wasn't an ocean view room, he told me they have no ocean view rooms, they are saved for guests that they want to sell a timeshare to, since we had been here before and did not buy the crimeshare, then we were not allowed to stay in the better rooms. I advised him that my Aunt wanted me to take pictures of the hotel and the view so that when she visits me she will have an idea of what type of place it is, and if I take pictures of this room and the "view" then she will never stay at this hotel. I told him that it reeks of cat urine and there are cigarette BURNS in the comforter, if this is a non smoking hotel why are there cigarette burns where I have to sleep? I asked him to please put us in the room I paid for and he told me, "When you called I had rooms for 40 people, but then I sold them all before you got here", I told him, "When I checked in, you said you were putting me in an ocean view room, and it wasn't a problem, this is not ocean view and it smells really bad", he told me, "I sold all 40 rooms before you got here", I told him, "It took me 30 MINUTES to get here, you mean to tell me you sold 40 people rooms in 30 MINUTES? And why did you tell me that you are putting me on the third floor ocean view?" His reply, "I thought you meant that view", I asked him "are you honestly telling me you thought "dumpster view" means "ocean view"?? I then asked to speak to the manager, Tobias I think his name was, got on the phone, I explained the situation and that I was lied to and he told me, "I got here at 11pm and there were ONLY TWO ROOMS available, your room and one other, we sold the other room", I told him "Someone is lying, because we called at 2:30am and was told there are plenty of rooms, we drove out here, it's 3am and now you are telling me that when you got here there was just two rooms available, but your desk clerk tells me there are 40 rooms available...who is lying to me, and WHY? I was planning on taking pictures of the hotel for my Aunt, she has been wanting to come here and wants pictures of various hotels in the area, he tells me, "We have a room set up for pictures, it is a room we don't book, but we have it set up to look good for timeshare people, but we never book it, if you want to take pictures I will let you in that room but only for pictures" I explained to him that my Aunt does NOT want a staged room, she wants to see the actual place, and if I take pictures of this room and tell her it reeks of cat urine she and her friends will NEVER STAY HERE! The manager continued to lie, and I asked him why are there cigarette burns all over my comforter, does he really expect me to sleep in a room for $189 with the stench of cat urine and burnt up old blankets? The MANAGER then put the CLERK on the phone, so I told the clerk I want my money back we are leaving and never coming back. He told me come down, we don't care. I went to the front desk and the manager saw me and quickly ran out of the window and hide in the back room, never once apologized or anything. This hotel is not worth your time or your money! If you want a REALLY nice hotel, look up the El San Juan Hotel and Casino, yes, they are affiliated with the ESJ Towers, but it is built newer and they take the time to make it smell and look great. The price online is very expensive, but if you call the hotel directly and make a reservation you can get it for the same price as the ESJ Towers or cheaper!!! The ESJ Towers used to be a great place to go, but since they decided to sell to timeshares, they went downhill, it really is a dump, the rooms smell like a dump, the view they give you is really bad, unless you never stayed there, then you will get one of their ocean view rooms and they will try to sell you the timeshare. By the way, I marked "value" in rating this hotel as a two instead of a one, because when we did stay there years ago, we got the ocean view and it was one of the cheaper hotels in the area, and the beach is GREAT. So if it is your first time staying and you get the ocean view it's a good value, but if you don't buy the timeshare, I would suggest you don't go back because the way they treat you is really bad, and now in today's economy the better hotels are the same price, I would highly recommend the El San Juan Hotel and Casino! NOT THE ESJ TOWERS!- I called the business center prior to our arrival to ask about having a package delivered to the hotel. She said that it was fine and we just need to go pick it up in the business center. When we went to pick it up, they charged us $9! What for? Oh, to sign for it. -When we checked into the hotel, the woman checking us in asked for a credit card and said that they wouldn't accept debit cards. She said “if you didn't like it, then you can leave and go somewhere else.” Then we're told that it's going to be $100 per night held on our card IN CASE WE BREAK THINGS! -Upon getting to our room, we saw that shampoo and conditioner were $24 EACH, and not included with the room! -We were told by the bell desk that the hours of the shuttle were 10am-6pm, and the driver confirmed this. They only go once per hour on the hour, and they only go to the fashion show mall. -We ended up leaving the Siegfried and Roy’s Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat early to make it to the last shuttle back to the hotel. We showed up, but it didn’t come. I called the hotel and was told that the last run was at 5pm. I told her that we were told twice that it was from 10-6, she just said that there was nothing she could do. We ended up getting a cab back to the hotel ($12). -On day 2, we were woken up at 6:30 by the crew out by the pool using a leaf blower. I called the front desk and she said that there was nothing they could do about it. Never mind that the paper thin walls had allowed us to hear everyone partying until the wee hours of the morning and we were now up at 6:30, there was nothing she could do and she honestly didn’t care. -That night, we asked about the shuttle, just so we could clear it up. Once again, we were told the hours were 10am-6pm. When I explained the issue we had the night before, the bell man acted like I was stupid. He said that of course there wasn’t a shuttle at 6pm, the guy who drives the shuttle is off work at 6pm! So when they say that it runs from 10am-6pm, they mean that there are shuttles from 10am-5pm. How stupid of me to not understand that! -On day three, (after being woken up at 6:30 by the leaf blower again) we spent the morning on the strip and later went down to the pool. The woman handing out towels was irritated that we interrupted her conversation with her cute male co-worker and all but threw the towels at us. There weren’t any lounge chairs available at the first pool area, so we went up to the second area with these big white cushioned ottomans and sat down. We were then kicked out because they have a $100 minimum and we hadn’t reserved it. There was nothing to indicate that we needed a reservation (it wasn’t a cabana). We ended up going over to the back pool and hung out there for a few hours. There was a cocktail waitress over there with long black hair that was working her butt off and very nice. Didn’t see her very often and drinks took forever to get to us, but that was because the other girls working that pool weren’t doing anything but flirting with the cute male guests. -That evening, we went back to the hotel and called the front desk to ask about the dress code for Skybar. It was about 10:50 when we called. The woman explained the dress code, and we headed down to have a few drinks. When we showed up, it was closed. Turns out, the hours are from 6-11pm. The book in the hotel room is so old that it doesn’t even list Skybar, and the woman at the front desk didn’t think to mention that it was closing in 10 minutes. -We ended up going to the lounge by the poker room. It took a while to get the bartender’s attention. Not because it was busy, but because he was preoccupied with his conversation with the cocktail waitress. He kept looking over at me, but continued to chat it up with his co-worker. -On the last day, we packed up our things, and went down to the front desk where we discovered that we had been charged almost $100 for the mini bar, even though we didn’t take a single thing. Turns out, it’s all on a weight system and if you even look through the mini fridge to see what there is, you’re charged for everything you move. -We were also charged $15 per day plus tax for their “resort fee” which apparently covers valet parking, self parking, the shuttle, access to the gym, towels for the pool, and the phone in the room. That seems a little steep considering we used 2 towels, and rode the shuttle 3 times. -We still had 7 hours until our flight, so we headed out to catch the first shuttle to the strip at 10am. It never came. The old outdated shuttle had broken down and so we were stuck sitting there unless we wanted to pay for a cab. So much for the $15 resort fee which covers shuttle service!We both got sick and will explain below. We've been to Riviera Maya 6 times, and also 5 other areas in Mexico for a total of 15 beach vacations, so we've stayed in all types of resorts ranging from rustic to luxury (we love all kinds), so I can be objective in my review. I cannot stress this enough - this hotel is for families with lots of small children - I've never seen so many at any resort - couples will wish they had gone to an adults only. Resort is 75% Italian, 20% French Canadian, with the last 5% English speaking Canadians and Americans. I actually liked that I couldn't understand what people were saying, because when it was so noisy with all the talking, I could zone it out. We, along with other guests we spoke to, agreed, this hotel belongs to the Italians - I felt like I was intruding on their territory, because everything is geared towards them, which is great for them, not so much for anyone else. Although, I have to say the coffee and pasta were the best we've had at a resort, so I've got to say that their influence was positive in that way. Rooms: We were upgraded for free to Privilege in Bldg. 6. Beds were very comfortable for Mexico, so we slept well. Bathrooms were ok. Tiling in shower and floor were dirty and black with mold - needs to be regrouted, otherwise, I like that it felt like old Mexico. Closets were nice. No nice view on balcony in any room, so don't expect it, but that's not important to me. Pool: Awful, awful, awful. Way too small for the amount of people. It was more of a kiddy pool and the water was always cloudy unless you got in it at 8 a.m. Some Italians and French don't believe in pool diapers and some go in naked. It was hard to find a spot for yourself without being splashed or knocked in the head with a ball. Plus the noise level was so annoying with all the kids and loud parents. Then the loud music starts with the animation team doing their thing - there was no place to escape the constant noise - unless it was lunchtime and the pool was quiet. We also had to save a chair by 6 a.m. if we wanted shade. Beach: It had the prettiest color water in Mexico. During our 2 wk. stay it was too wavey to go in - saw a child being rescued from the current by another guest - don't know where the parents were. I walked the beach every day which was nice, but there was a constant large amount of seaweed(?) washed ashore, which made it difficult to walk. The other two flanking resorts were very diligent in raking, but Catalonia lacked the staff or just didn't care - looked trashy. The clumps of seaweed attracted some kind of sand flees and flies, which could explain all the bites I got. We also had to save a chair in the shade by 6 a.m. If you don't like to see topless older women and naked children, don't go here. Also, we witnessed naked children using the sand as their bathroom and the mothers who encouraged them to do so out in the open for everyone to see, didn't even cover up the sand after they were done - disgusting and disturbing. Restaurants: As most have said, nothing special, which is expected in Mexico. We didn't go hungry, but we've had better. Tables were nicely covered with cloths, but the chairs were always sticky and dirty - again, need more staff. My husband had tummy troubles after the 4th day, and I had the same 3 days before we left (bring Pepto). We never get sick at Mexican resorts, but we did at this one. My husband saw kids grab french fries, drop them on the floor and then put them back in the pan. We saw people licking their fingers, then using the utensils to serve themselves at the buffet - sanitary it was not. I always serve with my right hand, eat with my left if using my fingers, which is why I never get sick at buffets - didn't help this time. Also, food was never hot. I do have to say some of the pastries were very good and my husband enjoyed the crepes. Baked chicken was always good, too, at the buffet. Breakfast was almost a comedy with the bacon. As soon as the pan was put out, in 5 min. it was empty. I never saw anything like it. People would pile it on their plates and leave it empty for anyone else. Most of the time it was barely cooked, but when it was done right, it was good. All my husband wanted were 2 pieces to go with his eggs and he mostly had to do without it. One time, we sat at a table where I could see when they replaced the empty pan and I told him "Quick, he just put some out - go now!" We called it the "Bacon Watch." Grounds: Not as pretty as other resorts - not many flowers. The courtyards where the rooms are had the best landscaping. The walkway to the buffet was very nice and enjoyable. I thought it was a nice stroll, unlike some who complained it was too long - it took maybe 5 min. to walk from your room. The coatis were so cute along the path in the a.m. - who couldn't love those cute faces as you walked by, especially the babies. Service: Was fine and they all were so nice. They need more staff in the buffet, because they work so hard and are on the go constantly, but can't keep up with the crowds. This resort has too many guests for the property. We can see where they added rooms in the past, which tells us this resort was never meant for this many people. It was nice to get away and enjoy the warm weather. We made the best of what we could, but I would never go back (getting sick is bad, which is why I gave it the rating I did), nor would I recommend it to anyone....unless you are Italian and French with lots of very small children. animation team whoi would recommend Jewel Bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too.Don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining.Stop Read Before You Book This Resort Stayed 7 nights to long... Went May 24 - May 31, 2003.. Still have diarrhea and stomach cramps. Let me say that I am a objective person, and I sincerely read with an open mind these reviews before booking our trip. Trip starts off bad.. my suitcase was lost on a charter flight from Houston to Punta Cana. I was so upset because no one spoke english. The bus ride to the Breezes was horrid. First of all... no DWI's there... No License required either.. Crazy Drivers... and if you aren't sick from the flight - which is 4 hours...you will be car sick. Roads are horrible. It took about 45 minutes to get to the Breezes. Upon arrivial we checked in - and was given the key. No map of where the room is - no bellboy... On our own.. This place is huge... Don't judge a book by the cover! The place is attractive. Needs lots of improvement! Finally found our room... hot! AC problems. No one understood english... We called several times and finally an electrician showed up. No wasn't fixed. He said because I was using my hairdryer from home- I was causing more stress on the AC... Please! and all that comunication was hand signals...remember no english! After several calls and lots of frustration - we were able to move to another room... Total times moved 3 times until we had a room that was comfortable... Not cold, but decent. Also.. if you go here - it is like a fat farm..you will loose weight! Food is horrible.... The US hamburgers - the meat is white when it comes out of the package. Also, the buffett is open to air and it is hot, with crows flying in and landing on the fruit and bread.. I am so disappointed, because we had a wonderful time at the Breezes Bahammas and went 2 times...the food was great and looked forward to each meal... Listen..this Breezes needs to step up to the plate... The service and food is so bad.. so many people were getting sick and had been sick for several days... I am a RN and I had brought imodium and several other stomach medications..Well, I am so glad... I helped so many people re ill. That is ridiculous - on vacation - which most people save all year for this special time. I know this sounds bad, but if I can save someone from going here and wasting your money and time.. I wish so bad we would of stayed at Iberostar Bravera - A fantastic place. I talked with many people on the bus that had stayed at Iberostar and they had a wonderful time. I would pay extra - will be worth it. The beach and water is magnificant in Punta Cana. The water so aqua and can see your feet in neck high water. Also at the Breezes no tipping allowed; but they expect it. The service is poor! Only if you give a dollar which is 25 dollars in pecos - will you get your pepsi refilled... and do not drink the fruit drinks. Made with their water. Also the lettuce is washed in their water... people were getting ill. The deserts were ok, but you might find a crows foot imprint in the cheesecake... I am not kidding! The resturants are hot...no AC - well I guess they figure you want eat as much... got that right.. so all inclusive.. need to re-evaluate that reasoning if you go there. The management is not willing to help make your stay pleasant. Like the customer is always right motto... Not there. If we could have left we would have... believe me we tried. We met other americans there and everyone had the same complaints.. Also met people from England... his wife had been in bed for the last 5 days ill. Had booked 2 weeks there. God help them... Oh yeah! Bugs in the room! And bathroom! no hot water. and the rooms were less desirable. Also advertised is a stocked mini bar in the room. Not! only pepsi and seven up... no beer and if you ask someone there about it, they shake their head and never return. Don't try to call US either - will get hung up on 40 thousand times. This is so aggravating. No one understands english... Now if you are going to serve the American clients - someone needs to take a english course. I will return to Punta Cana one day - but not to Breezes nor will I ever stay at another Superclubs Resort ever.hat maybe we would have gotten some kind of recognition. Also the upgrade that our travel agent said we were promised from Superclubs representative - never happened... that is how they show their appreciation... I will tell everyone I know not to go to Breezes- Punta Cana. Such a waste of time and hard earned money. I hope your vacation is a better experience. Also read these reviews...will save you lots of research... I did many hours of research prior to us chosing Breezes... The reason why we chose this place was because of the two times we had success in Bahammas.. Gosh.. doesn't even seem like the same company. Also, for the entertainment - lots to be desired. I have college boys and they litterally had to make their own entertainment. The casino is so so so small. Also...if you forget pants - you will not be allowed in the in door resturants. In door resturants are so hot... no one wants to eat. The excursions are worth checking in to... do not leave the resort area. This is a 3rd world country...very poor people. Hard to imagine that there are some beautiful resorts in such a desolate areal. By the way... the Medical MD..will charge you 200 us dollars to tell you you are sick... Hello! Be carefull, bring plenty pepto, imodium...might want to get prescription diarrhea medication..because imodium want touch this stuff. E-mail me if you have any questions...hope this helps you make your decision... also please talk to someone that has been there... you are traveling so far not to know what is ahead of you.... Also...some of these travel agents need to get out more and visit these properties - before they can recommend them.... Thanks for your time in reading this review... I will be sticking with Iberostar properties from now on.Punta Cana, Yes...Bavaro Princess, No way!!! Our story is almost exactly as the other travelers described previously. My husband, two children (ages 8 and 7) and I traveled to the Bavaro princess from New York Metro Area over the February Winter break. I had been hoping for the best, in spite of the negative reviews that I had read previously. I wasn't expecting haute cuisine, but I figured for a so called five star resort that the food would be decent. I knew things were going to be bad when I arrived and tried to book the platinum package and was told that they were sold out. I told them that I didn't care about an upgraded room, that I simply wanted to pay the extra for the premium liquor and the ability to make the dinner reservations in advance (I could write another whole review about how screwed up the reservation system is in this place. The reservation system opens at 8 a.m. and by 9:30 a.m. all of the early reservation times to the least of the crappy restaurants are gone! The only thing opened is dinner at 10 p.m. You have to stand in line unless you have the platinum package.) I was told that they were sold out of the platinum package, period. We arrived at our room, which was supposed to have been ready. We had a filthy bed cot sitting in the middle of the livingroom. After an hour, they arrived to remove the cot (service is not a strength at this resort). I then went to take a shower and had the entire faucet to the shower come off in my hand. No one could take a shower and get ready for dinner after an afternoon of traveling. That took another hour to fix.The buffets, including the Hispanola (which is where the largest buffet is), the Chopin, which is essentually where everyone has to eat dinner the first day when they arrive because all of the reservations are gone, and the buffet by the beach where El Gaucho is are all AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!! The MC Princess should be sued by McDonalds for even trying to imply that what they are serving is hamburgers and hot dogs! The only thing that is edible in any of these places was the pizza, which was surprisingly good when it didn't have ridiculous things like corn and cut up hot dogs on it. My husband and I admit to being snobbish New Yorkers when it comes to food and dining, but we honestly came here with the expectation of the food just being decent and edible. It was neither. The Ala carte restaurants I'll rank in order:1. Sakura- The least crappy- Says it is Japanese but is actually almost all Chinese, except for the disgusting sushi that they try to serve in the beginning. If you like Chinese, you won't mind this place.2. El Gaucho- Better than Sizzler but not even close to Outback, let alone a decent steak house.3. Bella Pasta- Makes Olive Garden look good!!! I finally realized that the people who thought this place was good are the same people whose only exposure to Italian food IS the Olive Garden! Again, My kids ate pizza here, and my husband was in our room hurling his brains out from the seafood place the night before, which brings me to4. El Pescador- how anyone could make grilled lobster tails taste like a mushy tastless garbage, I'll never know. Red Lobster will seam like the finest seafood place you've ever eaten at after this one! In fact, a can of tuna will look good after this place! Nothing was good here, not even the dessert.Besides the food tasting terrible, it made all of us so sick. My 8 year old son was the first to get sick on the second night with violent vomiting, followed by violent diahrea. My husband was next with violent vomiting by the third day. I was not so lucky. By the third day, I had stomach cramps that would not go away for the entire vacation. I thought my youngest daughter(who is a diabetic and has a very careful diet) was going to be the only one to get away unscathed. On the last day, however, she began running a fever, and became ill on our first day home.I enjoyed many of the people who I met, and did not find the Europeans rude, with two exceptions- one person wrote of the Russians on their cell phones and this was very very true. Everywhere, loud conversations by the Russians. I will say, however, that the Russians were very friendly and nice. The second incident, I will not allow to cloud my judgement about an entire nation of people, but this rude, nebbish little balding Frenchmen tried to cut into the reservation line in the morning. Already in a pretty upset mood from, you know, the whole my family being food poisoned thing, I started yelling at this rude little man to get off the line. He pretended not to understand English, until the other people on the line also yelled. Even then, it took the man from the hotel who was making the reservations, to make him get off the line.I don't want to end this review on such a negative note, so I will end by saying that Punta Cana is spectacular. The beaches were absolutely amazing, pristine and clean. The Dominican people were very nice and worked very hard. We tipped the bartenders, our maid, and the people in the restaurants who gave us good service, regardless of the food. We did not, however, see too many people tipping. That is just wrong. These people work very hard. Our two favorite people, I need to mention, were Ruben and Melvin who work at the pool bar. They were the best, always had a strong drink and a smile.Bottom line, I'd never ever go back to the Princess, not even for free, but I'll do my research and find a better place to go when I return to Punta Cana!Iâ€™m writing to warn everyone who is considering stay in this hotel. I wanted people to know what happened to me and hopefully you will understand it's not worth to take the risks. This hotel totally ruined my vacation and I will always remember this horrible experience. Safety is the most important thing while traveling in NYC and this place is DANGEROUS. Crime happens in this hotel everyday! I seriously think the hotel should be closed down by the government and I truly don't know why they are still in business. My husband, my sister and I arrived at Hotel Carter on 09/15/05. It took us 2.5 hours to check-in. (They donâ€™t have a computer. Every thing is memorized in hotel stuffâ€™s head or written by hand. Unfortunately, the hotel stuffs are not very organized, they messed up peopleâ€™s reservation and they donâ€™t seem care or feel sorry.) While we were waiting, we saw so many unbeliveable things happened... 2 girls who had left their luggages in the hotel's storage room but the bags are gone when they came back. (Note: The hotel charge $2-3 per bag but they are taking responsibilities for your stuff.) Two polices came and found out a guy who works in the hotel stole the bags and dump the empty bags in a big trash car. The hotel manager seems known that but he protent he didn't know. At the same time, there were 15-20 people complaining to the hotelâ€™s manager about no water in their room and some said their TV/air condition are not working (PS. it was 90 degree and humid in NYC.) Hotel manager told everyone they are aware of the problem and are fixing it. By the afternoon, water will be available at every room. Even people are not happy but they accept the fact that they are not getting water any sooner. Finally we got our key to the room and we were told that our room is ready. I opened the door, there are still 2 people in the room and... well, un-dressed. I apologized to them and back to front desk and asked for a new room. We waited for another half hour. (While we are standing there, the stuff blame each other for the mistake they made.) They gave us another room and we found there is no water in our room. So we back to the lobby again, and the manager â€œpromisedâ€� that when we come back in the evening, water will be available. So we went out and started our first day in NYC. After walking on the Time Square whole afternoon, we returned to hotel around 7:00PM- exhausted and smelled and of course we all wanted to take a shower. As soon as we get into the lobby, there are so many people argued with the hotel stuffs and things start to hit up- we Shockley found out the hotel had no water for TWO DAYS!!!! Many of the people didnâ€™t shower for two days! Of course they are angry and frustrated. Unbelievable! My husband questioned the manager and asked him to tell us the truth- either the water will come or not. The manager said with really cold voice: â€œNo body knows, I donâ€™t know either, I hope the water will come tonight, but I donâ€™t know, I cannot guarantee!â€� My husband tried to understand why they didnâ€™t tell us they have this major problem when we check-in in the morning. And he wanted to know if they really have people fixing the water system or not- we didnâ€™t see any plumbers or workers. The manager just totally ignored his questions and walked away. I also heard one of the hotel stuff shout to another man and a couple: â€œDonâ€™t ask me, I donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t know (repeatedly), go away, OK? Stop asking me! If you donâ€™t like, you can go! Go!â€� As you can imagine, people started to shout back to the stuff. There were also about 20-25 people waiting for the check in- some of them stop the check-in process and tried to get their money. Some of them just standing there hopelessly and donâ€™t know what to do. My husband started to raise his temple as well. Allow me to point this out clearly, he is a very gentle and lovely person. I have known him for 12 years and I have never seen him like that. Like other people, he asked for the money back, the Asia lady told him â€œyou can go if you wanted to go!â€� But she has no intention to return our money. We started to argue with her and she said: â€œGet out, get out! You get out of my hotel, I donâ€™t want you THESE KIND OF PEOPLE here, donâ€™t even thinking to stay here again!â€� â€œExcuse me, who wants to stay there ever again? I never ever again step in here even you give me money to stay here!â€� I found myself shouting back to her. After talked to my husband, we decided to leave. I cannot let my sister (who flied 18 hours to New York to join us) staying there. She was absolutely exhausted. We stormed back to our room and get our stuff down to the lobby and prepared to leave. There were even more people. We also saw two poor girls who lost their baggage and the guy who is in-charged for the storage room seems not care. He in his poor English, telling the girls: â€œI donâ€™t know what happen to your stuff, they are gone. I have no idea who took them.â€� People started to lose control and one of the guy tired to bit up the hotel manager and the guy. The Asia lady is still shutting to people- by the by, she was standing behind bullet proofs glass the whole time. She keeps asking people to come up-front if they wanted to check-in!! No water in the building, and they still want people to check-in? It just doesnâ€™t make any sense to me. My party and I were kicked out from the hotel at 9:30 PM at night in NYC. At that time, 99.9% of the hotels in the city are booked. We spent an hour to call all the hotels on the yellow page. Finally we found a four stars hotel for $410 a night. Needless to say, we have no choices- we ended up stay there. Over all, itâ€™s such scary experience. And also this is why I detailed what happen that night in order to show you how bad the hotel is. I seriously think the hotel should be closed down.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Carlsberg don't do hotels but if they did ... this would be the farthest thing from it. OK, before I begin what is most definitely going to become a "rant" I should mention the one good thing about the Hotel Carter. That would be its location; itâ€™s in a fantastic place close to Times Square, the bus terminal and a short stroll to 5th Avenue. Ok, now for the "rant". I read a mixed bunch of reviews before I went on my trip about haunted rooms, thefts and it not being the best of hotels. But I thought "hey, Iâ€™ve stayed in some pretty cr*ppy places, how bad can it be?â€� Well let me tell you, it can be BAD!!!! We (my girlfriend and I) arrived at the Carter late on Thursday 14th December 2006. We were greeted as we opened the door by the delightful whiff of the greasy cafe that is, for reasons unknown, adjoined to the hotel entrance. As we climbed the hotels steps, tastefully decorated in Technicolor patterns, set off by the various tones of dirt, grime and trodden in chewing gum I took the opportunity to admire the strange dolls that are displayed in glass cabinets around the entrance. As I admired them, and the 3 working Christmas lights that surrounded them, I enjoyed the tasteful out-of-tune music that played in the background. I can only compare it to a musical Christmas card that was low on batteries. Not put off, my girlfriend and I made our way to the reception. The first thing that struck me about the reception area was the fact that it had clearly been designed to stop people leaping the counter and attacking the hotel staff. This being New York, I thought perhaps these sort of things happen. When I met our "Friendly" night receptionist, I soon learnt that all this security was in fact to keep her in. To say this woman was rude is an understatement. She had clearly attended the Adolf Hitler School of charm and passed with honours. After we received what I can only assume was the standard level of abuse and rudeness (and were charged for the pleasure) we made our way up to our room. We were on the 19th floor, and let me tell you a ride in the lift (which I believe was last serviced upon the buildings contraction) is an experience in itself. Will you make it? Wonâ€™t you make it? Itâ€™s all very exciting. When we got to the 19th floor hallway, the first thing that strikes you is the lighting or rather, lack there of. There is a 40 watt bulb once every 40ft, so its kind of like staying in a poorly lit multi-storey car park (but dirtier). We made our way to our room and arrived at our door that was tastefully decorated a nice shade of green/dirt with a few dents and smashes for good effect. On entering our room we saw that it was last cleaned some time in the mid thirties. The linen looked relatively fresh, except for a very suspicious stain, and the bathroom â€¦ well, lets just say if the room was cleaned in the mid thirties it was by a lazy cleaner who forgot to do the bathroom. But still, as Iâ€™ve said, Iâ€™ve stayed in some bad places and was not about to let a few decades of dirt, an abusive receptionist and dodgy lift put me off. I was in NEW YORK BABY â€¦ Having emptied our stuff into the spacious wardrobe (ooh another good point, sorry there was two) my girlfriend decided to have a quick wash before bed. As she did this I lay on the bed and decided to check out the wonder of American television. No sooner had I turned on the TV then came a yelp from the bathroom followed by the door opening and my girlfriend in fits of hysterical laughter. I walked over to see what was going on, when I noticed what was coming out of the taps. Now, Iâ€™m not too sure how to describe this but it was kind of like lumpy gravy with flecks of grey. Thankfully, we did have both hot a cold running versions of it. I was going to phone reception to complain when I remembered that this may mean I would anger the receptionist and god forbid, they set her free to come find me. So, we left the taps to run for 10 minutes or so and they did eventually run clear. So, I went back to my laying on the bed and watching TV when something caught my eye on the wall. I looked, and with the reviews of this being a â€œhaunted hotelâ€� ringing in my head, I saw a pentagram had been etched into the wall. Fan-bloody-tatstic! Immediately wanting to get this out of my mind I thought I go to the window, pull the curtains back, and have a look at New York by night. I was quite impressed with the 5 square foot of Times square I could make out from our window and watched the bits of HUGE advertising boards I could see light up and change. As I stood there, I became aware of my right leg starting to get cold. Assuming the ghost of the Carter had come to get me I slowly glimpsed down to take a look at it. But instead of a gruesome spectre I instead saw that there was a hole, about the size of my fist, in the wall leading directly to the outside world. I was all set to complain, when I realised there was actually a better view of Time Square from the hole than there was from my window. So that was my initial experience of the Carter, and frankly in the 2 nights that followed, it didnâ€™t get any better. No doubt you are now reading this thinking â€œwell if it was so bad why the hell didnâ€™t you change hotels?â€� And the reason for that simply was we were there with another couple and the chances of getting 2 rooms on the weekend before Xmas were not good. Plus, I wouldnâ€™t have been able to have such a good rant had I stayed somewhere different. So, in summary â€¦ would I stay at the Carter again? NO. Yes it is cheap, but not cheap enough to warrant the state the place is in or the rudeness of the staff. I would highly recommend more spending a bit extra and staying somewhere where you donâ€™t need several inoculations before visiting.Royal Service- A Joke! After reading all the reviews, I realized that there are always going to be people who will complain so take some of the reviews with a grain of salt. I don鈥檛 consider myself someone who is hard to please or high maintenance so I thought this would be a great place to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary even with some of the negative reviews.We paid for the Royal Service and when we arrived were told that the king bed we booked was not available and we would have 2 double beds and that no kings were available. Nice way to spend your anniversary in seperate beds. They didnt even seem to feel bad. Our butler did a brief tour of the grounds and took us to our room and that was the last time we saw him until our last day. We asked him if he could reserve a palapa for the next morning and he said he wasnt so sure he would be able to get one since it was already 4pm but would look into it and then we never heard back. We called the concierge that night and asked again if we could reserve one and they said no problem. ???? Its almost like they want you to think that things may not be possible and like they are doing you a great service when they can make it happen so give them more tips. BTW, we tipped our Butler when he took us to our room and brought $200 in ones/fives to tip more but never had the opportunity. Also, there were several empty palapas the next morning so it wasnt a problem at all to reserve one.The first morning we wake up to construction at 8am. Banging etc. Like they couldn鈥檛 wait a little longer to start up and not wake up everyone. Our room wasn鈥檛 cleaned at 2 pm, so we called and asked for it to be cleaned. We come back to the room at 4pm and its still not cleaned. We have no clean towels and are supposed to be getting ready for dinner. I went up to the Royal Service Suite to talk to someone about all the problems we have been having and the impression I get is that they could care less. No one ever follows up or asks if everything is fixed etc. The 2nd day our phone is broken. So no calls to our butler to reserve palapas or make dinner reservations, order room service, ask for our room to be cleaned etc. Everytime we want to use a phone we have to walk out to the pool bar and use theirs. I called the concierge to ask that someone take a look at the phone and no one ever shows up. I wait 24 hours and when I was at the gym, I use the phone and call to follow up to see when someone would look into it. The response I got was 鈥渨e will send someone and if it doesn鈥檛 work then just call us back鈥?OK, how am I supposed to call you back when my phone isn鈥檛 working and why don鈥檛 you figure it out and follow up with me, why do I have to spend my vacation following up with you on all these problems? Finally someone shows up and says that its broken and they wouldn鈥檛 be able to get someone to fix it until the next day (the day we leave) and do we want to switch rooms. FOODGABI BEACH- horrible, we rated it a C-. there was not many people there and service took forever. Its fine if you are going to take a while to bring food, but at least make sure we have drinks, water or bread etc and acknowledge us every 30 min or so. We were just left there with no one helping us, no water etc and there were plenty of staff to accommodate the few couples eating there. VENTO-Breakfast- C+. Again service took FOREVER. There were only 2 couples in there when we arrived so shouldn鈥檛 have taken 75 minutes to eat. VENTO, PASSIONS  HIBACHI- mediocre to good. Service was better but you may want to get used to getting up to get your own drink from the bar as they often forget or take 30 min to bring it to you. There were other couples I met in Royal Service who also experienced problems. One couple was on their honeymoon and their AC wouldn鈥檛 get below 77 degrees. They had 3 ac repairmen come, all who said there was nothing wrong with it. ???? Many people complained that their rooms didn鈥檛 get cleaned also and that they never saw or heard from their butler or that the restaurants took forever to serve you. The rooms are nice. In the bathroom there is a box of soap, shower gel etc. I opened it the first day to take a bath. The next day when I was reading the brochure I noticed that they mention that there is a $40 charge for this so I went back to the package because I didnt remember seeing anything on it that said there was a charge, plus this is an all inclusive so why would they do that? There is a small $40 sign on the bottom corner of it. I would never have opened it if I knew it was $40. Also, for Royal Service, you can have aromatherapy baths drawn in your room by your butler. I called to see I could have this done or if they could just bring me the stuff for the bath and I would be happy to do it myself. They didn鈥檛 understand a word and said there wasn鈥檛 anything like this and that I had bath gel in my room I could use. I went and re read the brochure and sure enough, this is something they offer but then I couldn鈥檛 call back because our phone was broken. It was just one thing after another. Surely not what I would expect especially when paying for 鈥淩oyal Service鈥?I have been to other all inclusives where I didn鈥檛 purchase extra service and the customer service wasn鈥檛 even comparable. This was by far the worst vacation I have had. I would never go back and never recommend this place to anyone. You could do so much better for the same amount of money you spend here.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY Please take the time to read this review as I have read the others and they are a bit misleading of the 'Secret's Experience'. My wife and I decided to go to this resort for our honeymoon (June 7-June 21), after reading the reviews here and following up with the travel brochures. What we experienced was the worst vacation in our lives! The people that wrote these great reviews are obviously out to lunch or do not understand the meaning of what a five star resort really is! From the moment we got onto a bus with no SUSPENSION for the hour long + ride to the motel to when we finally left I have never been so disappointed or upset....Check-in as others have mentioned is an utter disaster.....no one speaks English or seems interested to try.  They tell us after an hour of waiting in the stifling heat that our room will be ready in a 1/2 hour as they were preparing it for us....Come on you start cleaning the room when we get there, what type of BS is that! Anyways follow the bell hop to the room ...its clean but when I pull open the drapes there is a 200pd topless woman lying on the chair two floors below. They put us on the side that has the topless pool...how nice! Back to front desk to see what we can do and were told that there was only one other room available and that was overlooking the swim up bar. open the door and the room was clean but there was two separate beds...Come on what are these people new to the planet or something! I tell Marcia at the front desk and I could swear that I could have gone further talking to a magazine. No help whatsoever.. Told us to come back in the morning and there would be more rooms avilable. Wake up Sunday moring to the sound of the bar music blaring....same for Monday morning when I couldn't take it anymore....Told Marcia and everyone else at the desk how pissed off I was at their incompetance and the whole thing with the separate beds...She told me a lot of europeans come to the resort and want separate beds, and also that other people paid as much if not more than I did for the accomodations, of which i answered I didn't care what other people spent, I spent less money and recieved better service ......obviously these people have no sense of customer service....I wasn't born yesterday and have traveled to many resorts in the caribean and to many countries in the world and never slept in a bed separate from my wife...We are both originally from Italy and could not understand where they came up with that idea but if you know people are newleyweds wouldn't you think they would want to sleep together???? Anyways after much fighting, that resulted in me calling my travel agent to try and book us a flight home at any expense, we were finally visited by a hotel manager who apologized and and a formal apology from the hotel manager, we were finally put in a beautiful room on the garden side of the complex looking over the Gazebo. (that was after 4 days of fighting). Food was nothing spectacular and was very repetative from day to day...very limited menus and to eat outside you were taking a very big risk.....lots of mosquitoes, I mean tons. Not much in seafood, I had to ask for shrimp because it wasn't on the menu. The food is definitely not five star- more like 2.5.  I have read other reviews of people saying there wasn't a mosquito problem....hah lets put it this way, no where was it safe on the resort except maybe your own room. we used to have to run it quickly and close the door for the bugs not to get in the room. Sittin in the pool the bugs would bite you wherever you had exposed skin...bit one girl on her eye lid and around her eye..Not a pretty site. You know its really bad when you see the fogger trucks driving around the resort at night, and the manager told us they brought these in from a military base. This went on for roughly 4 days before it was brought under control..During that time the small convience store was selling OFF bug spray for $10.00 US per can. One couple told the manager tha the resort should pay for it since it was their problem, but was told that they had no control over the what the store sells...what a joke. The screens on the sliding door did nothing to stop them from coming in as we would open the drapes to find many of them in the moring. It was at that point that I decided to see if they had any RAID at the store...the man said he could bring some in at a cost of $15.00US, so I bought another 2 cans of Off at 10.00 and went to the room and sprayed arond the screen door and front door, removed the light from the patio and sprayed around the light by the front door. Worked just as good and didn't have any problems after that! The trip on the Atv was a trip through HELL. Bug infested areas with all kindas of manure littering the road and a lovely(sarcasm) trip through a town where stopping on the bike meant being swarmed but many begging kids. One atv ran out of gas and we had to wait for the truck to come and refuel the bikes. Not prepared at all. All I have to say is Thank God I got a Hepatitis shot before I went on this vacation. If any of you are having a problem figuring out why it gets the highest ratings from Apple vacations in the States...they own a portion of the resort. All the tour operators from here in Canada have since removed the resort from their brochures. If that is not a evidence of a problem I don't know what is. The other tours are mostly drink fests where they get you so inebriated coupled with the heat, you think your having a great time. The horse ride has to be booked in advance and the horses are not riding horses....they are work horses and show the scaring and open wounds to prove it to you. Some are so emancipated you can actually see their rib cage. I have ride'n many times and was honestly scared for my life on these horses...one actually took off in the other direction and had to be chased down by the handler...the poor girl on it was shaking and crying. Another horse started to try to Buck the man that was on its back off of it. The saddles are not riding saddles and if this was in the states or canada the humane society would be there so fast it would make their head spin. Total mistreatment of animals. I guess I pretty well said all I have to say about this place besides telling people not to go and would not recommend it to anyone.As someone who has stayed in many Las Vegas hotels on and off the Strip over the years, I was expecting a minimum standard for this off the beaten path hotel on Paradise Road which is quite far from the Strip. I booked there because I was attending an industry conference at the attached convention center and thought it would not be too bad. I was disappointed over and over again during my stay. I booked a KING BED SUPERIOR ROOM STRIPVIEW on the hotel website- the most expensive rate available and as a Hilton Platinum Member was excepting something decent but... First, check-in (7pm) Pb 1: No special line for Hilton Platinum Members, only one for VIPs which was not manned by anyone. Fine, I lined up with everyone else for the 2 receptionist on duty. 15 mins wait Pb 2: Showed my credit card and was asked to sign my name on the electronic screen. My rate and length of my stay were never confirmed. I was just given keys by the harried attendant who pointed out which elevator bank I should take ( a 5 mns walk) Pb 3: She gave me the wrong directions! After going up and finding it was the wrong tower, I came back down and went to the correct tower. Another 5 mns walk! Pb 4: Entering my room, I noted that a) it was not a king, b) it was not "strip" view. I called the front desk to change rooms and was asked to come back to the lobby since there was no one who could quicly come up to me with keys to a new room Pb 5: back down at the front desk, I was now suspicious and caught the receptionist trying to give me a room near the elevators even though my Hilton profile specifically indicate that this was not my preference Pb 6 finally entering the correct room -it is now past 8pm, more than one hour after I lined up to check in. The room was just ordinary, standard hotel furniture, a rather used look but no obvious hygiene problem. Strip view? Yeah, far far away you can glimpse the Winn hotel on the left and the Stratosphere on the right Stay: The whole hotel looks old and tired. Game area was sad with mostly an over 60s crowd playing the penny machines. Pool was closed for renovation, only option was to schelp over to the Hilton Grand Vacation on the strip (a 1/2h walk or take a cab) and show your card if you want to use the pool. I wonder if anyone ever did that? Since it was late that first day, I decided to have dinner in the Hotel Steakhouse (TJ's) with a colleague. Big mistake. Restaurant decor was abysmal, prices were expensive and service was very poor. The only reedeming thing was a pretty decent steak but I think it is hard to mess up a 22oz filet mignon. At $80 per person including a glass of wine, it was definitely not worth it. Other nights, I went on the strip but this hotel is so far from everything, there is NOTHING within 20 mns walk. Use the taxis if you can afford it or the monorail if you can't. I still remember the days when the monorail was free! Not anymore my friends. Room: Inconsistent evening turn-overs. One day it was done, another it was not. Don't care too much either way but if you do or don't do something be consistent! Usual dime and nickel in the room, $3 water bottles with Hilton Brand name so you can't drink it and replace it by a cheaper one from a supermarket. High speed internet at $12.99. Thank god for my laptop air card. Local phone calls at $1. Thank god for my cell. Fax number: not written on the room phone! Why? They don't want folks to receive faxes free! They want you to use the business center fax number where you will pay dearly! Still faxed myself my return flight boarding pass but had to pick it up downstairs and bluntly refuse to pay the $1 they wanted for the privilege. How cheap! ATM: don't withdraw cash there!!!! Apart from the usual $3 surchage, a colleague who tried to withdraw money was given instead a print out to take to the Casino cage because the machine had ran out of cash. There, he was asked to show his card and ID which were photocopied, sign some documents, appose his fingerprint (!) and wait for 10 mns before they reluctantly gave him his measly $100!!! UNBELIEVABLE! Convention Food: catered by Hilton: abysmal. Even though the organizers had payed for a packaged breakfast for the attendees, there was insufficient items. Bagels and hot water ran out after 10mns and were never replaced. A little reception around 6pm the first day had the worst appetizers I had tasted anywhere. I could go on and on but bottom line never again! If you can afford it, pay a bit more and go elsewhere or do your research and pay less and go elsewhere. Only come visit if you want to do the Star Trek experience or attend one of their shows which feature mostly have-beens anyway. I can't wait to give the same feedback when Hilton sends me a comment on your stay request as they always do!Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now.

That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Do Not Waste Your Money!!!! We arrived on Friday, August 10, 2007 to the Ocean Bavaro Resort and Spa in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. We waited approximately three hours before receiving our first room, which was Room 5201 in Bloque 5. The air conditioner was leaking, floors dirty, beds too small, room smelled of smoke intensely and the furniture was in deplorable condition. The reason for having a non smoking room is the fact that my husband is a chronic asthmatic and this smoke filled room could trigger an asthma attack. There was a big chip in the tiled floor making the room look in very poor condition. In addition, the refrigerator was not working therefore all the water and soda was warm upon our arrival. The bathroom had water pouring down from the ceiling in two areas both by the mirror and the toilet area. Please note that we were a party of 7 and we needed four rooms to accommodate our family. After being extremely disappointed with our rooms and knowing this is not what we paid for, we spoke to guest services to have our room changed immediately. GUEST SERVICES decided to change our room to VILLA 6603, which was worse than Bloque 5. It seems this may be common for the Ocean Bavaro to move folks from one room to another and they acted as though they were doing us a favor. This Villa Room 6603 was again disgusting and in deplorable decrepit condition. The floors were dirty, the closets old and dirty, the bathroom moldy and not clean along with two windows located in the bathroom over looking the shower had no covers over them so, one could see into the bathroom. The furniture was old and not clean as well as the furniture being in poor condition. During the 24 hours in this room we of course did not have any towels or toilet paper unless we tipped the unfriendly maid or basically took it ourselves. I believe at one point I went to the front desk demanding towels and toilet paper. These workers could not care less about us and our requests. After feeling physically sick over this second move to villa 6603, where I was now away from my family who was still in their disgusting rooms in Bloque 5; I was even more upset knowing I had been moved to this horrible location and away from my family. I decided to speak with the Apple Vacations representative on site who set up a meeting with Mrs. Maroa Parada, Guest Services Manage at the Ocean Bavaro Resort and Spa. We met with her on Sunday, August 12, 2007 two days after our arrival to Punta Cana. At this time, my parents in Bloque 5 were unfortunately in a room where the soap dish fell off the wall, the air conditioner was not working properly, the beds were too small, the furniture in deplorable condition, no remote control and the toilet bowl that ran constantly. In addition to this, once Guest Services moved us out of 5201 in Bloque 5 they had the nerve to move my friend in that room and said they could not give her another room. This room was deplorable and she had to use the horrible dirty moldy unsanitary shower for two days. She had to shower with shoes on since the condition of the bathroom was so unsanitary and possibly hazardous to her health. We informed Mrs. Parada, the Guest Services Manager of the Ocean Bavaro Report and Spa the following items of disgust:飪楽HORTAGE OF TOWELS飪楬ORRIBLE FOOD飪楽HORTAGE OF TOILET PAPER飪楴O REMOTE CONTROLS IN OUR ROOMS FOR THE TV飪楤ROKEN AIR CONDITIONERS飪楴O STAFF TO ASSIST AND SPEAK ENGLISH飪楧IRTY BATHROOMS AND RUNNING TOILETS飪楴O RESPONSE AT THE FRONT DESK 飪楤ROKEN REFRIDGERATOR飪楽MOKE FILLED ROOMS飪榃HEN CALLING GUEST SERVICES 鈥?NO RESPONSE- OR TOLD SOMEONE WOULD GET BACK TO US BUT NOONE EVER DID.飪楻EQUESTED WAKE UP CALL AND NEVER RECEIVED IT.飪榃ATER BROKE IN SHOWERS DAY BEFORE LEAVING AND HAD NO WATER IN OUR ROOM TO TAKE SHOWERS-FOUND OUT ALL THE OTHER ROOMS IN OUR GROUP EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING.飪楽MOKE DETECTORS DID NOT WORK IN THE ROOMS-NOT EVEN ON WHICH MEANS NO BATTERIES WERE EVEN IN THE SMOKE ALARMS.飪楴O BAGGAGE HELP- HAD TO MOVE OUR BAGS OURSELVES THREE DIFFERENT TIMES.飪楻ESORT WAS APPROXIMATELY 800 ROOMS AND APPROXIMATELY 1200 GUESTS WITH ONLY APPROXIMATELY 300 STAFF PERSONS. 飪極NLY TWO GOLF CARTS TO TRANSPORT AND ONE GOLF- CART WAS BROKEN. NOONE TO MOVE BAGS FROM ROOM TO ROOM OR ACCOMMODATE MY FAMILY.Mrs. Parada worked with us and decided to move all four rooms and 7 people to the ELITE CLUB. This would have been our third move and quite exhausting to keep moving our belongings across the resort in the heat. We all moved to the ELITE CLUB ON SUNDAY, AUGUST 12, 2007 AROUND 2:30PM. The appearance of the rooms seemed slightly better however the bathrooms were still moldy and the service left much to be desired. I felt that I HAD TO TIP in order to get toilet paper, washcloths, large towels and water. This seems unacceptable to me as I already paid to be at the resort with all these included items. You would think being located in the Elite Club would have made our stay that much better but quite honestly this room was just a regular room and just as unpleasant and unacceptable. The same occurrences happened in the ELITE CLUB as the two rooms we had before. The list above covers the same horrible environment that we had all week long on our vacation.My husband and I noticed in Room 6311 of the Elite Club where we were residing that the air conditioner was leaking. We immediately called the front desk only to be transferred to Guest Services and then to be hung up on. In addition, the person who answered the phone originally claimed he could not understand me as I told him the water pipe is broken in our room. After being extremely frustrated I walked from the ELITE CLUB on the third floor to the front desk to speak with the manager at 1am in the morning to resolve this leaking AIR CONDITIONER. The next evening the leak got worse and now the room was flooded in the entrance way and I slipped on the water. After calling again to the front desk and having no luck with anyone to help me or understand ENGLISH, my father was able to find two young men roaming the property and they looked like maintenance men 鈥?they were kind enough to fix the air conditioner. This was unacceptable as I should have been able to call the front desk and ask for assistance and know that someone would arrive and fix the broken appliance. Please note NOBODY showed up at all which tells me that they never intended to help me and luckily my dad found those two men to fix it.OVERALL, This was a horrible time at the OCEAN BAVARO RESORT AND SPA. Apple Vacations should not be promoting this resort as a special to anyone as it is an unacceptable resort for anyone. I am putting in writing that I want a refund for all expenses incurred for this trip that is not what was advertised Apple Vacations. In addition, Liberty Travel should not be sending any of their clients/customers to such a place that is in deplorable condition. All expenses and incurred expenses should be refunded to my credit card for this horrific and unacceptable experience.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting.

Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining.How can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices?!Great food… beautiful room…and that is where it ends and the problems start. My perspective. I am a very athletic 36 year old male. I was looking for a beach resort with some shopping, and lots of beach activities including scuba and snorkeling. My view is probably affected by the weather during my stay, which was pretty much non-stop rain and overcast sky’s. This is an issue with the location, not the resort. I speak fluent Spanish, so the issues with the resort could not really be blamed on a language barrier. We had high hopes, since we received an awesome welcome, champagne in our room, flowers. That night we came back to our room to find artistic displays made with rose petals on the floor, on the bed, and even in a ready for us bubble bath in our in room Jacuzzi. It was truly impressive, almost overwhelmingly flattering. We were extremely appreciative. Unfortunately…things went downhill from there. •Expect a lot of mosquitoes. With repellant we still received a dozen or so bites per day. The resort is basically on a mangrove swamp, where it meets the beach. You MUST kill the mosquitoes in your room before going to bed. Otherwise, each and everyone one of them will leave their mark on you during the night. •Weather, we were told was very unusually bad. It rained every day, several times a day. It varied from warm to cold during the day. It was rarely, if ever, sunny. •It is literally a min 20 minute trip each way to and from the main road to the resort. Why? Because the road is a dirt road full of pot holes, which is difficult to navigate. Cars need to pull over constantly to let each other through, as often only one car can pass at a time. The other hotels are all paved roads. As our week got further along, the road conditions got worse. We saw an SUV stuck in a ditch on the side of the road. The road was turned into a one way road, alternating every 15 or so minutes. So only one direction of travel at a time was allowed. Change that time to 30-40 or more minutes to get from or two the road from the resort. Compare to a couple of minutes for the other paved entry way resorts. We were told this road condition was due to government regulations against paving in this “protected” area. You will feel nauseas by the time you finish your drive through this road. We all did. The driver jokingly referred to it as the Mexican massage. The road sucked for us, but was horrible for the poor staff, taxis, and shuttle drivers. •Unlike my previous resort experience in Negril, there are next to no water activities. If you want to scuba or snorkel you are looking at a whopping $120 for the trip, and spending the majority of the day getting to and from the location. This is a total waste of time if you are paying to be at the resort. Activities, such as a boat trip to a reef from the beach itself would help. But according to what I was told, the hotel would not allow it. So..if you want to spend $120 for an excursion and suck up most of your day, otherwise don’t bother. •There is only 1, yes one, heated pool. The majority of the advertised pools are either the small pools in front of the swim up rooms, or decorative pools which are about ½ foot deep. The “Jacuzzi” pools are according to the staff, not supposed to be heated. We had a cold surprise. The swim up room pools are way to cold to use. The one heated pool closes at 6. Yes, 6 pm. The swim up bar, while it is open, is quite nice. •Room service is horrible. The food was always cold and took a good hour to get to us. The food itself was extremely good, and a decent selection. The service itself…. •Maid service/mini bar refilling… it took several walks to the front desk, phone calls, and finally help from the concierge to get some basic things such as the mini bar refilled, the dvd remote, a laundry bag with order for, a bottle opener for the mini bar. Pretty much most of this was resolved after half our vacation was over. Please keep in mind I speak Spanish fluently and tried in Spanish and English asking for these things various times daily. •The new “flat screen tv’s” are great. Like a ferarri, driving on sand. Because the signal going into them is through an archiatic coaxil cable, and your pay per view movies, along with tv shows will look like a poorly dubbed vhs porno tape. I spent a long time explaining to several people there the different connection protocols and basics of hooking up an HDTV. End result is your t.v. will look like an old warn out t.v. at a motel 6. •We hade random lights turning off and on. Our alarm clock gets reset to 12:00 every few hours, making it… useless. •Eventually we were moved to a new room do to electrical and other problems with the first room. Just like in the first room, I had to hook up the DVD player which wasn’t hooked up correctly to the tv. The two audio jacks were hooked up, one to the audio channel, and the other to a random port that was spitting out a video signal. So basically you got sound out one side, and static hiss from the other. •Heaven help you if you need to have clothes washed. By the end of the trip do to the constant rain and humidity, we have no dry clothes. They provide a laundry service, if you want to pay $5 per shirt, or pants. •“Spa Credit” is a scam. $20, $40, $40 not $100 as we were told. And you can only use one at a time. So really, it is $20 or $40 off of a $130 50 minute massage, which is more expensive then at a ritzy spa here in Newport Beach, CA. If you go into Play de Carmen instead, the price drops down to about $35 for the same. •The fitness room is hardly “state of the art” as they advertise. It is adequate, and comparable to an apartment building gym room. 3 or 4 aerobics machines, and 4 or 5 strength machines. There is a rack of dumbbells going up to 50 pounds. Adequate for average people. •The “dive shop” is not. It is a booth that hands out towels, and sells offsite diving trips. If you are into diving, look into a hotel in Cozumel, as most of the trips require you to a) get to Cozumel, then take a dive boat from there. •The internet access in the rooms was “out of service”. So even if you wanted to pay the extra for it, it wasn’t available. The internet café type room they had with 3 or 4 computers was quite adequate and never much of a wait. Also wireless is available in the main lobby. •All inclusive does not include tips. In most cases it isn’t “required” but expect to see tip jars at the bars. Tips are openly excepted. On the positive side: •The food at the restaurants was very good, especially the Italian restaurant. The French restaurant was horrible. Do not ask for anything outside the normal flow or dinner, as far as changes or substitutions. I asked for a desert instead of an appetizer. The waiter basically completely blew me off. Shoot me for being different here? • The onsite night club is, by Newport Beach or LA standards excellent. • The theater had some excellent entertainment including. • Expect good service from the bartenders and restaurant staff.Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food, and there was no one to recommend any wine.Where do I begin? I'm a Platinum member with Starwood and I have stayed at a number of Starwood properties. This is by far the worst one I have ever stayed at. I emailed the hotel four times prior to arrival and for whatever reason they were unable to tell me whether I could anticipate an upgrade being a Platinum member. Little did I know this is because this is practically a glorified apartment complex completely filled with time share owners. Here is what has transpired so far: -Check in and ask for an upgrade due to being a Platinum member. I call literally 1 hour prior to check in and they cannot tell me if I'm going to be upgraded. Therefore I pack up the family (after having stayed at the Sheraton on Maui which was absolutely fantastic by the way. I highly recommend this property over the Villas). I check in and they do give me an upgrade from the studio to the 1-bedroom villa. Excellent, or at least so I think. My upgrade is on the 2nd floor, facing the pool directly over the walkway to the pool. Normally a pool view isn't bad, however when there is literally a 24/7 frat party going on at the pool being directly over the walkway to the pool insn't my idea of an upgrade. As soon as I opened up the patio door I could literally hear about 100 people shouting and screaming during an avid game of pool volleyball. Oh by the way, the jacuzzi is open 24 hours (use your imagination here). -Kids: Keep in mind that I brought my two kids and I have to say that aside from a Justin Bieber concert I've never seen more kids in one concentrated area then I have here at the Westin villas. When we first arrived I kid you not that there were literally 50-60 kids in the pool at once, all screaming and dunking each other. Not exactly what I signed up for. -Patio Grills: Good luck gettiing one of these. You literally have to fight the guy in the 24 Jimmie Johnson wife beater and cut-off jean shorts to get one. Keep in mind he's the same guy who just got back from Costco and purchased about 20 lbs of 2-day old chicken, 5 gallons of potato salad and a pony keg of Old Milwaukee. Good luck with that! -Cleaning: Ah yes, you would think that if a resort charged $500-$600/night that it would include cleaning. Not at the Westin Villas. We stayed 5 nights and the room was cleaned once. If you want it cleaned daily you need to pony up an additional $25/night. What a deal! -Getting a Lounge Chair at the Pool: Good lluck!! Be prepared to get up around 6:00 am and beat the stampede of time share owners down to the pool to get anything withing a 100 ft radius of the pool. The great thing is that everyone will reserve 4-6 chairs by putting towels down and then leave to go back to the room for 2 hours. Plan on spending your time at the beach. -The Beach: You mean all 10 feet of sand that runs from the resort to the water. Don't forget the 45% angle the beach is on so if you love lying out in the sun diagonally then by all means this is your place. -The Room: Toilet doesn't flush; Shower broke and we had to call maintenance; ceiling fan runs at about 3 mph; did I mention that you have to pay to get it cleaned? Oh yeah. -Pool: On Day 3 we decided to try our chances at the pool around 4:00 pm. As we stroll up from the beach we notice a number of people leaving the pool area and heading up to their rooms. I look at my wife and think "could this be the moment? could we actually get a lounge chair?" As we get closer to the pool one of the 'security guards' informs us that one of the 8 million little kids decided to drop a Baby Ruth in the pool. That's right folks, a brown log, a muddy missle. In my 38 years of existence I've never had to vacate a pool because some little kid dropped a log in the pool. After asking around this appears to happen quite frequently. They literally close the pool on the spot. We head back to the room and I call the front desk to ask if perhaps they could give us a free movie for the inconvenience. Their response was to send us to the South Pool, which is about a 1/2 mile away. I'm sure it won't be crowded after the 5,000 people at the North pool mosey on over there. -Pool Service: Good luck getting someone to wait on you. We had one server literally walk past us 15 times and not once ask us if we wanted something to drink or eat. He was more concerned with the 15 college kids ordering drinks. Unless you're in a group of 10 or more you may as well do yourself a favor and walk up to the bar yourself. -Use of other Starwood properties: Not so fast!! Being a Westin Villa guest they do not allow you access to the other Westin property or the Starwood (which is awesome by the way!!!). You're stuck fighting the 12.4 billion people staying at the resort for pool chairs and space in the pool-that is if you can dodge the feces some little shaver decides to spit out. -Accommodating: Don't be fooled by the token replies you see by the Westin staff on TripAdvisor. They sent me one as well. They make it appear as if they're so accommodating. I requested to transfer my stay (after 3 hours of being there) back to the Sheraton) and everyone approved it (Sheraton, SPG Platinum) and they said no. Keep in mind they were at 98% occupancy so they literally had about 5-6 rooms available. Thus the sweet upgrade over the walkway to the pool. The Sheraton somehow is rated two categories below the Westin Villas (have no idea how this happened) and yet they still flat out denied my request. Their response was to pay 50% off the rack rate and not give me any of my money back. Yeah, they're real accommodating. Seriously, you'll see a ton of responses from the Westin staff. It's all a big marketing ploy. They don't accommodate anyone! Trust me on this one. I busted my tail to become a Platinum member and have spent thousands of dollars over the last 12 months and they couldn't even transfer my reservation to what they claim is an inferior property. If you're even contemplating staying here please reconsider. If you love being around 2.3 million kids (and that's real close to the actual amount) and you enjoy little ones dropping Caddyshack like Baby Ruth's in the pool then by all means pony up the $500/night and knock yourself out. If you don't want an atmosphere that reminds you of a glorified apartment complex then you'd be better off staying at the Days Inn.Bavaro Princess Nightmare Prior to leaving for the Bavaro Princess, my family and relatives that joined us on the trip were looking through the reviews at several of the vacation sites, and many of these reviews were far from positive. I figured that people writing these reviews were rich snobs and had way to high expectations for the resort. Knowing that it is a five star resort, I could not believe that this resort was as bad as it was said to be.After a moderately long 6 hour flight from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada to Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, we could rest assure that we were bound for a week of relaxation and indulgence into what was supposed to be a five star resort. Arriving at the gates of the resort, was like arriving at the gates of heaven, with lush gardens, and magnificent floral arrangements and massive palm trees. As we stepped off the bus we walked into the grass-hut-style-entrance-way were there was a bar, travel agent representatives, stores, a nice pond with turtles and fish, and of course the check-in.Here is where things became interesting. When my parents purchased the holiday package, we purchased the VIP package, which included all international drinks, two bathrobes per room, free massage, newly renovated rooms that were supposed to be ocean-view, several passes to the a la carte restaurants and to the gourmet restaurant The Licey. Our first wrinkle in our vacation started when we were not given ocean side rooms, which we were okay with. However, what really turned us off was how we did not get rooms remotely close to our relatives, which was arranged through our travel agent that called the resort and specifically asked for. We went to our rooms via golf cart train which was nice to have as the resort was very large. I tried to remain positive after the discussion with the front desk staff, but was again immediately disgusted as we passed through what seemed to be a sewage management site, where the aroma of raw sewage filled the air. Finally we got to our rooms, whice coincidentally smelt like sewage as well.We asked for another room, and we were told that we could not have one and that we would have to wait for a few days. Finally, we were given another room after three days. The rooms were okay, but had several problems, with them. My perfectionist personality was not satisfied, as the rooms were not cleaned very well, like how the bidet constantly became dirtier and no one was using it. We soon learned that, tips of five dollars American, plus candies, and other gifts were enough to get our floors swept.Now to get to what was the worst about the resortThe food. Dining at Bavaro Princess was like being on Fear Factor food challenges. The Buffets were interesting with the varieties of cheese, lunchmeats, and interesting seafood. The Bavaro Princess has truly mastered to art of blood sausage as they have managed to incorporate it into as many meals as possible. I must say that the al Carte restaurants had amazing service, but lacked in the food department. We went to the Licey on my cousins birthday. The food leading up to the main entr茅e was satisfactory. As we came into the Dominican Republic as a group of eight, many of us ordered what was called the Princess Lobster, it was a combination of pineapple and curry on a grilled lobster. On first inspection of the lobster, it looked like it was diseased, and first taste tasted like it was diseased. The strength of the curry was enough to choke, and the pineapple did not help. My advice on choosing at The Licey would be the steak or the veal chops, both were actually very good. Breakfast was a constant disappointment, as blood sausage was once again in the mix. My suggestion is eat the yogurt, fruit breads but stay very far away from the omelets or the eggs, as they are extremely undercooked. El Pescadour was my favorite restaurant it was a seafood restaurant, which was flawless, the lobster there was excellent, and everything else was fantastic. The Brazilian steak house was all right. My only suggestion would be to stay very far away from the Brazilian bread, as there is again blood sausage on toast. The Italian restaurant, which I believe was called Bella Pasta, was a terrible disappointment, from raw veal, to the Princess pizza, which included slices of hot dogs, and yes more blood sausage, not only was a weird combination but also was inedible as it smelt like a hockey bag full of very used equipment. The other restaurant, El Gaucho I believe it was called, was another seafood restaurant but in a buffet style. Everything was actually so revolting I stuck with bread and ice cream. I urge you to do the same as there are flies eating the same thing you are for whom knows how long. Finally the snack house and the bars. The hot dogs at the snack house were deep fried, which I found to be very unusual, the fries there were also very undercooked and saturated from the oil. The Bars would serve adults first and then children, I once stood in line while several adults would so kindly cut in front of me.Speed of service was incredibly slow as we almost missed our flight because the bellhop took 2 hours to get 2 bags.The entertainment was also brutal, as a clown would stand on stage and scream at everyone in Spanish while children would be following him. After the childrens show was over we would watch people dance around and lisping the 70s music, with what looked like an elementary school play.Some other highlights of our trip were swimming next to someones feces in the pool and spotting used tampons on the pathways. Also beware, that there are countless topless women, and men in G-Strings, if you have children that you do not want to be exposed to this, or find it offensive, find another resort!Although the resort was mediocre, and the food was terrible, we managed to have a good time and can laugh about how bad it was there. Oh and by the way, bring lots of money because imported food is very expensive there. I would suggest bringing some of your own food, too. If I were to go back there, I would pack an electric frying pan and bring a weeks worth of food in a coolerNo Joke!I would strongly recommend not booking a trip at this resort regardless of whatever your travel agent tells you. If you are from North America, you will be strongly disappointed.We just got back from Mayakoba after staying 6 nights, and could not wait to leave. We would have left to go to the Ritz Carlton in Cancun had we been able to without forfeiting about $450 in tours we had already scheduled. If you are looking for a place to sit at the pool or beach and do only that -- sit (and drink or read), you could probably do much better elsewhere. There is a beautiful golf course if you want to play in 90 degree heat and 90% humidity with the bugs and mosquitoes, or utilize the spa. However, my girlfriend ruled out the spa after the repeatedly poor service we experienced. We had issues from the moment we arrived. The service was so bad in every department, that at times we wondered if we were on a hidden camera show. When we asked for things, we either got something different than we asked for, or nothing at all. For example, I ordered four beers (for the reasonable sum of $30) from room service that I chilled over ice and stored in our room's refrigerator. I went to enjoy one later the next day, and they were warm. I called the front desk to see if they could send a maintanence attendant to check the machine and was told that it was a "beverage center" and not designed to keep drinks cold. What, then, was it designed to do? It certainly looked like a refrigerator. After reading about the "standard refrigerator" in each room in the in-room resort guide, I asked a room service waiter the next night if the machine in the room was indeed a refrigerator. My question was met with a quizzical look, as though I asked him if the canvass and rubber things on his feet were shoes. I said that it wasn't keeping my drinks cold -- he, of course, responded by saying, "uh, maybe it's broken." Duh! However, after asking him to send a maintanence person to the room, my refrigerator / beverage center remained, uh, broken. This may seem nit picky (not to me), but imagine every time you ask for something, from requesting one foam pillow one night and having all of your feather pillows replaced with foam pillows for the rest of your stay, or asking to be picked up from your room and having no one show up, or being completely ignored as you sit at the bar as the bartender breaks down the liquor bottles with five tables seated 40 minutes before the bar is actually supposed to close, it gets really old after a while. This is not what you expect from a five star resort, and we were fed up after a few days. Frankly, if we were staying at Fast Eddie's Roadside Motel, I would have overlooked the dead dried bugs on the white bedspread, the bathroom thermostat that didn't work, or the broken sliding doors that I almost cut my foot on trying to get them to close properly. But this is supposed to be a five star resort -- so I did notice these things, and when they are not isolated to one or two things, it becomes quite irritating. The food and menus at El Puerto and Las Brisas (the property's signature restaurant) are totally substandard if you enjoy eating (great) food. I was amazed at the complete lack of local ingredients and the limited local fish available on the menus. Who wants to eat duck, rack of lamb, Cornish hen or risotto in 90 degree heat? Further, the food quality was so bad that we actually cancelled our main courses at Las Brisas and went back to the room to order room service. This was after sending back three drinks in a row: a signature martini that was served room temperature and smelled truly like vomit, a special margarita that was made with brown sugar, lime juice and tequila (imagine honey and tequila, not a tasty combination) and a dirty Grey Goose martini that was green and murky because it was all olive juice with a splash of vodka. At least they didn't screw up the beer -- although it took three times of me asking to actually get limes for my Pacifico. I actually got a call from the resort's executive chef the next morning who asked me to detail the problems at the restaurants we experienced, and he assured me that this was in the process of being fixed. (Apparently, the chef at Las Brisas left two weeks prior, presumably because the menu and fare is so poorly designed, unappealing and does not compliment or match the surroundings). To my surprise, he agreed that the menus were not up to the standard that their "main competitor, the Ritz Carlton up the road" are. Guess that was my problem? Overall, we had a very expensive vacation, and feel like we paid handsomely for a miserable and frustrating experience. We have stayed at the Kea Lani and had a totally different experience with Fairmont resorts. However, this resort does not measure up. In fact, I'll close with a comment the general manager made on our last night after I was so completely fed up that the front desk patched me through to his cell phone. After I recounted a few experiences with the hotel when I felt the service level was below expectations (we had a list of over 30 problems over 6 days), he responded by saying, "Sir, you made the choice to come to Mexico. What did you expect?". That pretty much sums up our experience. Apparently, one should not expect much. In fact, if you expect nothing, there's even a chance this resort may exceed you expectations! Don't go, unless you don't mind bad food, atrocious service, and a swamp marketed as a fabulous Mayan jungle. Trust me, it's only fabulous for the many, many bugs that live there...I am sitting on the plane about to leave Puetro Rico. I wanted to get this down while it was fresh in my mind. I just stayed at the â€œRitz Carltonâ€� San Juan for a week. To be fair, there were some good things about the hotel. The noise from airplanes that is often referred to on this site was not an issue. I heard one plane the whole time I was there. The grounds were amazing too. Tree ferns, beautiful fountains and palm trees were all over the place. It looked the part of the tropical get away. Now to the not so great thingsâ€¦ I want to let you all know that this hotel, while nice, should not be listed on the roster of Ritz Carlton properties. I found out during our stay that it is a privately owned Ritz Carlton and is franchised. The Ritz Carlton is supposed to be all about friendly world class service, at least the ones I have stayed at previously. This hotel is service with a scowl at its worst. On arrival, usually the staff at a Ritz Carlton will greet you and offer to take your bags. If the check in line is long, usually they will stow your luggage. No such luck here. We were forced to lug our 6 pieces of luggage into a line that almost stretched out of the door and the front desk person who was (the rudest person I have ever encountered at any hotel front desk, except at a little out of the way Howard Johnson at midnight in a snowstorm) took one look at my group of sweaty tired travelers and promptly told us that our rooms would not be ready for a while and that it was hotel policy to not let guests check in until the room was ready. If you want to know what she was like think the stewardess on Ben Stillerâ€™s plane ride on Meet The Parents. Yes, she is that bad! We asked for the manager and an equally rude individual reiterated her statement and then they started talking about us in Spanish not thinking that the stupid people in front of them could understand. I was very upset by this time and asked what other hotels were in the area because we werenâ€™t sure that we wanted to stay at the Ritz any longer because we didnâ€™t feel welcome. True to his rude demeanor, he started listing other hotels for us to go to and even offered to call a cab for us. I felt that this reaction was another slap in the face. He should have apologized and offered to correct their initial disappointing reception. When we finally got checked in the nightmare continued. As soon as we opened the door, we were hit with a strange smell in our room that was very similar to vomit and several stains on the carpet that were suspicious. The shower curtain was mildewed and there was a large crack in the window of our room looking out to our view. The carpet was soaked too and the internet connection didnâ€™t work. I couldnâ€™t believe that I had paid three thousand dollars for this room. Also, the internet is not wireless in the rooms. It is an Ethernet connection that requires a plug. You have to sit at the desk to use it. Sort of inconvient but once again not up to what the Ritz is usually about. I called the front desk, housekeeping and the management office for help with the smell and room issues. Both hotel managers were on vacation, one until August 6th, over two weeks from when were to leave! I was equally disturbed to discover that the only manager on duty was the rude person mentioned above. What a â€œgreatâ€� start to our long anticipated vacation. I was able to find, after much searching, the guest relations manager who is a lovely woman named Flavia. She is such a sweet person. She listened to my concerns and offered to send an ozone machine up to our room help get rid of the smell. She also offered to move our room if we wanted but we had already unpacked. In addition, she gave us a credit to be used towards food at the hotel which was very nice but I didnâ€™t ask for it. I think itâ€™s like someone cutting you and then offering to pay for the stitches. Nice offer but why did it have to happen in the first place? The ozone machine didnâ€™t help much but I was done by this point and didnâ€™t try to persue it any further.. The food at the hotel is not the best and drinks are outrageously expensive. A normal strawberry daiquiri (that pink drink that we all dream about while waiting to go on vacation) is $15 a pop! A Mojito (the islandâ€™s signature drink) is $16. The food at the main restaurant called Mareâ€™s is bland and extremely expensive too. Trust me! Donâ€™t plan to eat or drink there if possible. There was a nice girl named Rosanne at the Mare restaurant that helped us and showed us around the hotel the first day. She was also a bright spot in the otherwise disappointing staff at the hotel and gave us some good tips about where to go for good nightlife. The hotel spa is very small. Get this, there is a staff entrance leading right into the area where the steam room and jacuzzi are located. It is used at least once every 30 seconds by the staff coming and going. When you are trying to relax in the spa, staff members are constantly coming in and out and have no concept of quiet. They are often talking loudly and rolling carts right through the Spa! I could not believe it. Not relaxing at all. The pool is 3ft. 6 inches deep at its deepest point. This makes for tough swimming for adults but good for kids I guess. The beach was nice but there were several homeless people on it begging for food and money which was disturbing. Keep in mind that most of Puetro Rico is very poor and the Ritz is one of three â€œupscaleâ€� hotels in all of San Juan. I do not have any clue how they managed to get their 4 Â½ star rating. I have stayed at 3 star hotels that were better. Overall, I would say if you have low expectations, donâ€™t care about service and like the smell of vomit in your room or just want to get away, the Ritz is a good place to stay. It is a Ritz Carlton in name only. Itâ€™s similar to a good looking Holiday Inn or a nice Best Western. If you want a truly upscale experience with attentive staff, good food and a welcoming atmosphere avoid the place like the plague!!!I’m writing to warn everyone who is considering stay in this hotel. I wanted people to know what happened to me and hopefully you will understand it's not worth to take the risks. This hotel totally ruined my vacation and I will always remember this horrible experience. Safety is the most important thing while traveling in NYC and this place is DANGEROUS. Crime happens in this hotel everyday! I seriously think the hotel should be closed down by the government and I truly don't know why they are still in business. My husband, my sister and I arrived at Hotel Carter on 09/15/05. It took us 2.5 hours to check-in. (They don’t have a computer. Every thing is memorized in hotel stuff’s head or written by hand. Unfortunately, the hotel stuffs are not very organized, they messed up people’s reservation and they don’t seem care or feel sorry.) While we were waiting, we saw so many unbeliveable things happened... 2 girls who had left their luggages in the hotel's storage room but the bags are gone when they came back. (Note: The hotel charge $2-3 per bag but they are taking responsibilities for your stuff.) Two polices came and found out a guy who works in the hotel stole the bags and dump the empty bags in a big trash car. The hotel manager seems known that but he protent he didn't know. At the same time, there were 15-20 people complaining to the hotel’s manager about no water in their room and some said their TV/air condition are not working (PS. it was 90 degree and humid in NYC.) Hotel manager told everyone they are aware of the problem and are fixing it. By the afternoon, water will be available at every room. Even people are not happy but they accept the fact that they are not getting water any sooner. Finally we got our key to the room and we were told that our room is ready. I opened the door, there are still 2 people in the room and... well, un-dressed. I apologized to them and back to front desk and asked for a new room. We waited for another half hour. (While we are standing there, the stuff blame each other for the mistake they made.) They gave us another room and we found there is no water in our room. So we back to the lobby again, and the manager “promised” that when we come back in the evening, water will be available. So we went out and started our first day in NYC. After walking on the Time Square whole afternoon, we returned to hotel around 7:00PM- exhausted and smelled and of course we all wanted to take a shower. As soon as we get into the lobby, there are so many people argued with the hotel stuffs and things start to hit up- we Shockley found out the hotel had no water for TWO DAYS!!!! Many of the people didn’t shower for two days! Of course they are angry and frustrated. Unbelievable! My husband questioned the manager and asked him to tell us the truth- either the water will come or not. The manager said with really cold voice: “No body knows, I don’t know either, I hope the water will come tonight, but I don’t know, I cannot guarantee!” My husband tried to understand why they didn’t tell us they have this major problem when we check-in in the morning. And he wanted to know if they really have people fixing the water system or not- we didn’t see any plumbers or workers. The manager just totally ignored his questions and walked away. I also heard one of the hotel stuff shout to another man and a couple: “Don’t ask me, I don’t know, I don’t know (repeatedly), go away, OK? Stop asking me! If you don’t like, you can go! Go!” As you can imagine, people started to shout back to the stuff. There were also about 20-25 people waiting for the check in- some of them stop the check-in process and tried to get their money. Some of them just standing there hopelessly and don’t know what to do. My husband started to raise his temple as well. Allow me to point this out clearly, he is a very gentle and lovely person. I have known him for 12 years and I have never seen him like that. Like other people, he asked for the money back, the Asia lady told him “you can go if you wanted to go!” But she has no intention to return our money. We started to argue with her and she said: “Get out, get out! You get out of my hotel, I don’t want you THESE KIND OF PEOPLE here, don’t even thinking to stay here again!” “Excuse me, who wants to stay there ever again? I never ever again step in here even you give me money to stay here!” I found myself shouting back to her. After talked to my husband, we decided to leave. I cannot let my sister (who flied 18 hours to New York to join us) staying there. She was absolutely exhausted. We stormed back to our room and get our stuff down to the lobby and prepared to leave. There were even more people. We also saw two poor girls who lost their baggage and the guy who is in-charged for the storage room seems not care. He in his poor English, telling the girls: “I don’t know what happen to your stuff, they are gone. I have no idea who took them.” People started to lose control and one of the guy tired to bit up the hotel manager and the guy. The Asia lady is still shutting to people- by the by, she was standing behind bullet proofs glass the whole time. She keeps asking people to come up-front if they wanted to check-in!! No water in the building, and they still want people to check-in? It just doesn’t make any sense to me. My party and I were kicked out from the hotel at 9:30 PM at night in NYC. At that time, 99.9% of the hotels in the city are booked. We spent an hour to call all the hotels on the yellow page. Finally we found a four stars hotel for $410 a night. Needless to say, we have no choices- we ended up stay there. Over all, it’s such scary experience. And also this is why I detailed what happen that night in order to show you how bad the hotel is. I seriously think the hotel should be closed down.You will not be missing anything.On first appearance, The Grand seemed like a decent hotel for a colleague and I to stay during a one week business trip to our Toronto office. The staff seemed pleasant and the rooms/amenities were very much up to par. However, during my first nightâ€™s stay, I awoke sometime shortly before dawn with an extreme itching sensation all over my body. Having already had bed bugs once ten years before, I was justifiably paranoid and immediately jumped out of bed. However, still in a sleep-induced daze, when I did not immediately find anything, I resigned to catch another quick hour of sleep before my wake up call. I did not begin to notice any bites until sometime just after breakfast when we were heading to the office. After about a half day of suffering through discomfort, I was forced to step out of meetings to see a doctor. Unbuttoning my shirt, both the doctor and I were shocked to see literally hundreds bites all over my arms and torso. What was worse was that I was suffering a moderate to severe allergic reaction and had large protruding welts all over my body. Following the doctorâ€™s orders, I picked up some antihistamine and garbage bags before catching a cab to The Grand. I went straight up to my room, packed up and threw my suitcase and clothing into a big garbage bag. I went down to the front desk and informed them that I had contracted bed bugs from their room and requested to be moved to another. After trying to convince me that this had never occurred before, they sent me back to my bed bug infested room with a maid who was going to â€œconfirmâ€� based on her qualifications whether or not there were bed bugs present. Equipped with a large can of Raid, the maid led me back up to my room. After showing her some very small blood streaks on the headboard and what looked like the remnants of a bed bug shell, the maid denied that bed bugs could have anything to do with the situation. She then asked to see the bites and, when I showed her, she exclaimed that I was mistaken and that I was only having an allergic reaction. To this I replied that she was correct and that the reaction was to bed bugs as confirmed by my visit to the doctor. Speaking with the supervisor on duty (at this point I still had not spoken with the manager), I was informed that, although bed bugs in their hotel was a very unlikely scenario, they would be happy to move me to the one available suite in the hotel. Upon first glance, the penthouse suite seemed like a nice upgrade and, although I still felt unresolved with the situation, thought that at least the hotel was attempting to make up for it in one way or another. It was only once I had settled in that I had noticed tiny little black specks all over the hardwood floor. Looking at my feet, I was horrified to see dozens of tiny little black flies encrusted in the bottoms of my socks. Looking around the room, I saw what my colleague later claimed as â€œpiles of fliesâ€� littering the entire room. There were hundreds, if not thousands, of tiny dead little black flies all over the suite. I even found some on my bed that were still twitching, evidence that the room had recently been fumigated. However, at this point, I was dead tired and rather than having another ridiculous debate with the staff, I cleared the top blanket of flies off my bed and went to sleep. The next day, I spoke with the on-site supervisor again, explained the new problem and said I was unsatisfied with the service and conditions of the hotel. I politely requested that my medical and dry-cleaning bills be reimbursed even if I was unable to have the charge for my two nightsâ€™ stay waived. To this the supervisor explained that this was not the hotelâ€™s problem and that they would not be reimbursing me, nor would they be waiving the charge for my stay. At the end of the day, I am not a person who complains a lot. If I get served the wrong pizza at a restaurant, I usually just eat it so that it doesnâ€™t go to waste and I donâ€™t make the server feel bad. I also understand that bed bugs (and potentially other infestations) are a rampant problem in major metropolitan cities such as Toronto and can understand the hotelâ€™s reluctance to admit to any history of issues. But, as a customer, I have honestly never been treated so poorly and, the fact that I was forced to incur a number of charges that were no way attributable to negligence on my part, just seems plain old wrong (in addition to the dry-cleaning and doctor bills, I ended up having to discard my luggage, costing me hundreds of dollars). For these reasons, I feel it is important to share my story.They must be joking!! This is AT BEST a 3 star hotel......and a badly managed one at that. With all due apologies to those who wrote good reviews of this dump.....I can only wonder if you may have been caught up in the undeniable romance of Venice.....and been blinded to the astoundingly bad service and room quality of this vastly overated and overpriced snake pit. First......the rooms. Their excuse for ANY complaint about the run down condition of the place was "it's a very old, historic hotel". Right. So this means you can't shampoo the carpets in the rooms? I was afraid to walk barefoot in our room. The carpets were filthy......the paint was dirty as hell in many places.....it really looked as though NOTHING had been done to the room for 10 years. And the fact that it's a historic hotel prevents them from putting in decent beds? I've still got a back ache from the cheap, saggy mattress in our room. And the fact that it's an old, historic hotel means they can't give you decent sheets? You get the cheapest, scratchiest sheets you can imagine. I'm not joking.....it was like being in prison....the sheets were almost like sandpaper....I don't remember EVER feeling sheets that were so scratchy. To think that this hotel is owned by the same chain that owns the Westin hotels...which have the best bedding in the business...in beyond the imagination. Ok...suffice it to say that the rooms are a disaster (at over $500US per night, I should add). How about the service? Again....words can't do justice..... Let's start with the phones.....on THREE occassions I tried to call downstairs to get some info...all three times I tried the hotel operator, the front desk, and finally the concierge. NO ANSWER. I was totally ignored. My wife tried while I was in the shower and had no luck with the hotel operator or the front desk....but finally (on her fourth try) got an answer from the concierge. Even at a Motel 6 you will get an answer when you dial the operator. It seems that they just can't be bothered to pick up the phone. The hallways are full of VERY worn out carpets...and really look like some cheap old flop house...not a 5 a 4 a 3 or even a 2 star hotel. Amazing really. While down in the lobby bar...which is indeed very pretty....as one would expect from a building that 500 years ago was a palace....I was having a Gin and Tonic. This cost me $25.00. This is not a misprint, I said twenty five dollars for a Gin and Tonic. Perhaps I could live with this if not for the haughty and even distainful service offered by the "waiters". It's like they have a pre-rehearsed drill....you ask them a question....like...."what sort of nibbles can we order"...and they talk to you quickly...moving away from you all the time as though they have someting MUCH more important to do (and this while we were virtually the only people in the joint). I had to get up to go to the bathroom, and not wanting to go all the way up to our room I went to the public bathroom on the ground floor. Big mistake. Dirty.....and I don't just mean a little dirty.....I mean old, stained paint on the doors that nobody had bothered to clean in a VERY long time. No paper towels in the container to dry my hands. My wife had to go a little while later and reported not only the above complaints about the Ladies room, but also no toilet paper!!. She stopped at the front desk to complain on the way back to the table and was told "We can't check all the time, a lot of people use it". Jesus. It really sounds like I have some sort of grudge against this place, but the truth is we were VERY hopeful that it would be good and tried valiantly to find something good about the place. But the simple fact is that it is the DEFINITION of tourist trap. I've stayed in 5 star hotels in over 30 countries and this is not just the worst of all of them...but the worst by 500 miles. I can't even think of which one would be next up the ladder......the Danieli is so far "ahead" in the race for rock bottom. We went up with two friends to try dinner on the famous Terrace restaurant on the roof. We actually *were* treated quite well there....friendly and attentive waiters and hosts. The food, however, was only so-so. Not bad, by any means....but at $45-$50 for an entree, you expect a much higher standard of cooking. No artistry in the presentation.....little if no skill exhibited in the sauce department....just standard...."throw the lamb chop on the grill and slap it on the plate" fare. Overall, I can say without ANY doubt that this is the single worst hotel experience I've ever had......and I've had a few real doozies, believe me. If you stay in this pest hole you will only have yourself to blame. Venice is a tourist trap in general...with a LOT of very bad food and service...all at very high prices.......but the Danieli is the leader of the pack when it comes to *completely* focusing on how much money they can get out of you while doing the absolute *least* amount of work possible. Venice is beautiful, but I'm beginning to think it's not worth the bother. I've been three times now, and I doubt I'll go back. If you do go, I'd either get a very cheap 2 star hotel (it won't be any worse than the Gritti Palace or Danili, and at least you'll only be paying $100 a night, so you won't be terminally offended...or perhaps, if you insist on spending more for a "luxury" hotel...you could stay at the Monaco & Grand Canal...which actually is pretty good (within the greater context of the Venice hotel market.....don't think for a second that you'll like it as much as a *real* grand hotel.....like the Ritz in London, the Shangri-La in Bangkok, the InterContinental in Hong Kong, etc). So what did I find nice to say about the Danieli? Well.....it *is* in a very handy location...this can't be denied.I have used this hotel for several years, only because it has a good location (just a ten-minute walk on main streets to the Gloucester Road tube station on the Piccadilly Line) and because it was, for some time, THE cheapest hotel you could find in London. However, for the past few years my flights have taken me to Stansted Airport rather than Heathrow, so I used a very nice guesthouse in Golders' Green. Recently I was planning a week-long trip to London for theatre and just pleasure travel. As I was flying into Heathrow this time, I thought I'd check out the options, and naturally took a look at the Cromwell Crown website. I was very pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful, very attractive site that showed pictures of rooms that were nothing like the VERY BASIC, cheap hotel (more like a 1-star hostel, really) that I had stayed at so many times before. The price had gone up (from Â£30-35 per night a couple of year ago to Â£59 per night now, for a basic single ensuite room), but given the renovations and upgrades that the website alluded to, I figured this was worth the extra money. Alas, it was not to be. When I arrived, nothing much had changed. The lobby still has the same old, tired, torn furniture it always had, with the same Pakistani family running it that I remembered from previous years. Another thing that had NOT changed, either, was the fact that, when the desk staff were checking me in, all they cared about was getting my full week's "rent" paid up front. Interestingly, they had no difficulty taking care of that! However, as it turned out, that was about the most efficient they were all week. I couldn't wait to see the renovations, but as soon as I went to the elevator, it was obvious that the Cromwell Crown really hadn't changed much except a few bits of new carpeting and higher prices. The elevator is very small (maybe two people with luggage), very slow, and very erratic. It might come, it might not. About 3 times out of 5, it eventually came, but other times, it was as if it was broken. When you asked the front desk about it, they'd just shrug and pretend they didn't understand you. My room was just like they always were: VERY basic, and small. If you're lucky, you'll get a room at the back, because if you get one at the front (facing Cromwell Road), you won't sleep without earplugs. I should also point out that there is NO airconditioning and (from what I could see) NO HEATERS in the rooms either! So don't go in August, unless sweating is something you enjoy. The web site indicates that ensuite rooms are "spacious", which is true if you consider 12 inches between the bed and the wall to be spacious. There is, as the web site promised, a "work desk" (which is really a dresser for clothes.) There was no night-stand, so I used the "desk chair" for my alarm clock. The bathroom featured a very strong smell of mold and mildew, which was not surprising given the cracks and holes in there. It was a most unpleasant smell. The "colour television" is, in fact, a TV that gets BBC 1, BBC2, ITV1, and Channel Five. Reception is spotty: some channels don't come in at all. It is definitely NOT satellite reception. The TVs are suspended from the ceiling, and there are NO remote controls in any of the rooms. I've played this game with the front desk before, but it worked the same way this time: when I asked for a remote control the first night, I was told that they would check with housekeeping the next day. When I asked again the next day, I was told that housekeeping hadn't responded to the inquiry. When I asked the third day, I was told, sorry, there aren't any remotes. There never have been: at some point I was also told that "previous guests have stolen them!" (In EVERY ROOM?) I was curious to see what the "renovated" rooms looked like, so I asked the front desk staff if I could look at one. They gave me a key, and I went to see it. First of all, I don't know where they got those photos on their web site, but they certainly are NOT rooms found in this hotel! The "renovated" rooms are slightly larger, with new laminate wood flooring, but the work quality in these rooms is really pretty shoddy, and they don't have AC or heat either! (Oh, and no remotes in them either: I checked!) The beds have the same worn, threadbare blankets, sheets and pillows as in my "normal" room, and there really aren't very many "extras in these rooms. Those "new" rooms cost from Â£75 per night for a single, and really are hugely overpriced for what you get. The web site is highly deceptive at best, and in many countries could be construed as false advertising. Another example of this is the claim about free WiFi throughout the hotel. This was particularly funny: I took my netbook to the "renovated room" as well as to my regular room and tried to connect: no luck at all. So I asked at the front desk: "what about the free wifi in the rooms?" I got the usual shrug. When I persisted with my question, the clerk simply said, "there isn't wifi in any of the rooms: just here in the lobby." Oh, and to use that wifi (which is very slow, similar to dial-up speed), you have to get the clerk to give you a password. It may or may not work: what you end up doing is using the hotel's private network, so be very careful about that! I skipped breakfast, but don't be fooled by that picture of the dining room either. It doesn't look like that. In conclusion, avoid this place, unless you're on a very tight budget, you're only staying one night, and you don't mind loud, tiny rooms. I had also booked the Cromwell Crown for another trip in October, but I cancelled that booking after this fiasco. Just a few yards from the hotel is the Kensington Rooms Hotel, which has VERY nice rooms for Â£83 pounds a night! There are a LOT of inexpensive options within ten minutes' walk of this place: do yourself a favor and stay in one of those!Natural Beauty is the only thing this place has going for it. Let鈥檚 start off by saying, we travel a lot and I know what to expect from small third world countries that cater to tourists in resorts. I know everything is not going to be perfect, nor do I expect it to be. In saying that: there are some things that cannot be overlooked. Let鈥檚 start with the hotel room. We decided to get the honeymoon suite for the extra space and the upgrades. When we got to the room, we noticed that the air was not working. We attempted to switch rooms, but supposedly none were available. The ceiling fans in the room were on motion sensors, so when you laid down at night to rest-your only means of cool air would shut off. You would have to wake up and either wave your hands or walk around to get the air flowing again. When you left the room, the fans would shut off; so your room wouldn鈥檛 cool down for you while you were gone. Not good when you are coming in from the pool hot and sun burned. Also, the frig in the room is also not cold. It鈥檚 basically cool 鈥搒o that means hot beer and soda. The juice in there was not OJ, but some orange drink knock off.The pool was very nice and very clean. There was plenty of chairs pool side and covered. The pool was the best part of the whole week.All-inclusive bars: yeah well if you are ok drinking very cheap liquor then its great. There is only one type of Dominican beer on tap and it鈥檚 not cold. Its room temperature. They have top-shelf liquor on display, but most of the claim to either be out; or when they do have it to pour 鈥搃t鈥檚 watered down and they won鈥檛 give you much of it. Any drinks you request made with fruit juice; fruit or anything fancy is out of the question. Restaurants: Again- nothing that is normally served hot is hot- and nothing that is normally served cold is cold. Everything is room temp. This was when I realized that the week would not turn out ok. I arrived on a Sunday and by Tuesday; I had extreme stomach pain from the food. I spoke with several people at the resort to see if this was an isolated incident, but it was not. There were others in the same shape. I was not able to get out of bed for one full day due to stomach pain, nausea, and dizziness. Basically if you wanted cereal the milk was room temp. Anything on the buffet was also not on warmers. The safest thing to eat was bread and potatoes. Stay away from anything on the salad bar and that contained milk or cream bases.Also, in the restaurants with waiters; it will take you at least 45 minutes to get a table. They are understaffed. There were plenty of tables available but no one to wait on you.Picture Scam: The photography crew takes pics of the guests with several different animals from the local zoo. (monkey, parrot, lizard) and then you have to go the photo counter to see if you want to purchase, etc. The price is $15 per pic which I find pretty steep- but it was vacation so we purchased a few. However, when it came time to get our pictures the next day- the barely English speaking girl behind the counter, claimed they were not ready yet. After several days of checking and being told they were not ready, we finally got very frustrated. She kept claiming that the pictures had to be sent off to be printed. This was not true, we had just seen another staff person print someone鈥檚 pictures from the below the counter. We told her that we were leaving that day and that we wanted our pictures. She still said the same line- not ready. We then asked for our money back. At that moment, she turned around, flipped thru some folders and miraculously pulled out our folder of pictures that were ready. Nice. The clincher is: The 5x7 you think you are getting is actually a 6x8. Upon noticing this error-and letting them know that was not ordered because you cannot get that size in the states; they will kindly tell you that you can purchase 6x8 frames at the desk for $25 dollars.Grass hats- make sure you do not purchase these. They will be confiscated at the airport because they are considered 鈥減lants鈥?and cannot be taken out of the country. Make sure you do not forget sunscreen. The cheapest, smallest bottle in the resort is $22.Also, the night vendors will start off with ridiculous prices on everything. I tried to by a silver and coconut necklace and they wanted $300 for it. By the time I was walking away suddenly it $20. So, be careful. The spa- oh yeah- we tried this too. The massage was great! However, the aqua spa which is $35 for an hour- half of the showers and saunas were broken; so you couldn鈥檛 do the circuit training anyways.The beach- directly in front of the resort- you cannot enter the water due to rocks and seaweed. However if you walk past the resort in either direction- its great. You just have to be careful that you are not on other resort properties-cause they will make you leave.At the end of the week, we couldn鈥檛 even get the front desk to answer the phone to come get our luggage. At this point I was ready to fill out a comment card or say something. So, after bringing my luggage down two flights of stairs and to the front desk, I was told that I could not fill out a comment card.Not a great week. We had fun as a group amongst ourselves for entertainment and in the pool, but the rest of it was not fun on any scale. I am very disappointed to see that this was a 6 apple (star) resort according to Apple Vacations. I would hate to see what a lower star resort had. I paid $3900 for this vacation; I certainly don鈥檛 feel like it was worth it.Iâ€™m not one to do this, but against my better judgment, I took Rick Stevesâ€™ recommendation and booked a room at Hotel Flora. I arrived-after a long search to find the hotel which is located down a narrow dead-end kind of street-in the morning, and my room was not ready. Ok, fine, understood. Upon check in the front desk clerk asked for my passport, wrote down the information in it, and then insisted on keeping it until my room was ready, which made me really uncomfortable. I didn't then and still don't understand why, but I reluctantly agreed and left it with him. A few hours later, I returned and was given keys (yes keys) and shown to my room. First off, the key chain had a heavy door knocker attached that weighed about 3 lbs., and I'm not exaggerating here. Since my backpack was heavy already, I immediately removed this from the chain. Attached also, was a skeleton key for the safe (later on that). As soon as I opened the door to my room, I was unhappy. The room was very tiny-the bed almost ended at the bathroom door-and the decor was really in need of an update. I felt like I was in some weird cabin in the woods rather than in Venice, Italy. There were dark wooden shelves on both sides of the beds for your clothes, covered by a gold somewhat musty curtain. The shower was another story. The only way I can describe it is "small space capsule". If you've ever had a closed MRI youâ€™d know what I mean. I felt like I was standing in a pizza oven. I kept thinking that a large person could never shower in that room because as slim as I am I was having a difficult time moving around. Next, the safe. You could fit a wallet in it, and nothing else. The lock chamber on the back of the door to the safe was so thick it took up most of the space! I was always squeezing things in there and still had to carry the rest with me since there was never any room. Honestly, it was the tiniest safe I've ever seen. The only thing that was big was the key to it! When I returned to the lobby I asked if I could upgrade to a bigger/nicer room and very politely expressed my dislike for my current accommodations. I was told nothing was or would become available. I was perfectly willing to pay for a room like the one shown on the website-which by the way is the only one like it, I think, and the answer was no. I honestly think itâ€™s because I was traveling alone and they wanted/needed one of those rooms for two people. I saw many room keys dangling from the shelf behind the clerk at the reception desk, but my key was noticeably vacant because my room was occupied!! I settled for my fate and since it was only two days I thought I could live with it, but when I thought of the rate I paid, I was even more upset. This little single room cost me nearly 320 Euros (nearly $500 USD) and wasnâ€™t worth that at all. Two days later I stayed in a beautiful hotel in Florence for two nights that cost $252 Euros ($354) and had a room twice the size and breakfast fit for a king (later on that great review). Now breakfast. It was included, but thanks for nothing. It was the cheapest continental breakfast I've ever seen. Usually in Europe continental breakfast will include lunch meats, cheeses and scrambled eggs. None of this here, but they did have a small dish of hard-boiled eggs, so I do have to mention that. There's an outside garden but I sat inside, and there were birds flying inside and perching on the cereal dispensers eating the droppings people left behind. They were probably the only happy ones. That was really disgusting-not to mention unhealthy-and no one said a word or did anything. I mentioned Rick Stevesâ€™ recommendation again at checkout time because according to his book youâ€™ll get a 20% discount for doing so. Completely untrue! When I asked, I was told that I already had the lowest discount, so no. Meanwhile, this was the regular price so I donâ€™t know what discount they were talking about. I paid the more for this hotel than any other in Italy, and yet I liked it less than any other! Every time I headed back to the hotel I dreaded going there and I never felt like it was an extension of my home or had a warm and nice feeling when I was there. I traveled this time without a laptop so the only positive thing I have to say is that they charge only 3 Euros for Â½ hour, but considering Milan and Florence offered free internet, again, really, thanks for nothing! Please do your research and look for a better hotel. During my last trip to Venice I stayed at The Saturnia, which oddly enough is located directly across from Hotel Flora. I even considered just going there and biting the bullet, but since I felt ripped off already, I stayed. No matter how the The Romanelli family responds here, this is my true experience!Stay away if you're claustrophobicI read the reviews and firmly believe that grumpy people get grumpy people. Old furnishings doesn’t always mean a bad hotel and some people when it comes to cleanliness are a little too picky. I’ll try to provide the good points first, but this is proving to be a challenge. The location was close to SeaWorld and Disney. The lobby was nicely decorated for the season with a Christmas tree, a Menorah and 6 foot tall nutcrackers. The grounds, from what I saw of them at my 11:30 pm check in, where well maintained with a nice looking pool area and I looked forward to using the free car wash facilities. This is where the good ended and the bad began. The check in was slow and I was surprised at the number of times the phone rang at the front desk. There was a disgruntled guest at the front desk looking for towels. I just figured he had a long day and was a little grumpy…..boy was I wrong and I now understand why. Once Jeffrey at the front desk appeased his concerns by having security grab some towels, the guest left and I can only guess went back to his room. During this time the phone continued to ring incessantly. From what I could ascertain everyone needed towels. Once checked in, our horror story began. Upon entering the room I didn’t see the tell tale vacuum marks on the carpet but I chalked this up to just being an older carpet. I knew that the rooms looked a little dated by the photos and most of the reviews that I had read. I didn’t care I just needed a place for a week that was clean and was reasonably priced. About $1100 US with the bulk of the time in off season seemed reasonable for a place that rated 75% on TripAdvisor and came referred by CAA. After all, we weren’t spending our days in the room only eating suppers and sleeping there. We folded out the hide-a-bed and low and behold, no bedding. At this point I opened a bi-fold door thinking it was a closet, only to discover the furnace/air conditioner. The air filter had obviously never been replaced. It was dirt ladened and had holes throughout. There were dust balls in this little cubby the size of cats. I thought I’ll deal with this in the AM we can leave the window open…. Darn wouldn’t you know it - no screen…. Seeing this dirt, led me to check the cleanliness of the rest of the room. The dust behind the fridge was thick from the coils to the wall. There were dust webs and filth behind the stove, and a few lady bugs on the floor (the bugs, to me, were no big deal after all they were dead and in a corner and we were in Florida). The dishes were put away dirty and there were M&M’s loose in one of the cupboard shelves. The only thing that I felt was really clean was the tub, toilet and bathroom sink. At least they sparkled. At this point I made sure there were no bugs along the King size bed edge, and THANK GOD there weren’t. I proceeded up to the front desk to complain and to get some bedding for the kids. Jeffrey seemed genuine in his apology and gave me a blanket from the office and asked the security officer to get the rest of the bedding for me. He tried to find me another room but apparently the 3 rooms available still were not cleaned from the previous day. This was a Tuesday December 29th check in and they still hadn’t cleaned the room by 12:15 am on the Wednesday!!!! When I returned to the room, I met another couple from Ontario who advised me not to leave any food out and to keep it in the fridge. “The ants are bad,” I was told and “Oh by the way don’t ask for towels you won’t get any” When I returned to my room, my kids told me that there was no way they could sleep in the hide-a-bed. My daughter of less than 70 lbs sank into it like it was and inner-tube. Upon inspection, the underside of the mattress was virtually missing with cuts and tears throughout. Thank God for the King bed because that is where we slept for the night. Several minutes later, the security officer arrived with a sheet and 1 pillow case. This was all there was. I invited him in to ask his opinion of the room. We found more dirt! There was dust hanging out of the bathroom fan and dried spit along on the wall that had run down and clumped just shy of the baseboardll! It was obvious that the paint in the washroom had been done straight over dirty walls. He agreed with me that the room was deplorable and that he wouldn’t stay there in these conditions. Unfortunately, at this time of the night there were no other options. The night sleeping four in one bed was not the last straw. I decided that perhaps I was a victim of unfortunate circumstances. In the morning things would look better… They didn’t. I figured a shower and a coffee would change my mind. To my chagrin and the very last thing that put this whole experience over the top was one of the two towels we had was full of holes. We packed up and went up to the front to leave. Dawn (the supervisor) was pleasant and understanding and quickly processed my request to leave. I asked to speak to the manager (Christina Lopez) to advise her of the condition of the room and to at least give a little kudos to the staff that all tried, be it failed, to make my stay pleasant. Dawn, Jeffery and the Security Officer (whom I think I’d rather keep nameless) were as pleasant as possible and appeared to be genuinely apologetic, but it seemed to me that they felt their hands were tied by the circumstances. Christina also apologetic tried to make excuses for the whole event. New cleaning manager, new towel service, can we put you in one of the owner rooms with new TV’s etc. etc. etc. It wasn’t the furniture or the appliances, it was the cleanliness that led to my decision to leave!!! My biggest regret is that I didn’t take pictures. With the dirt of the place we didn’t bring anything in but a suitcase and the cameras were buried in the trunk. In conclusion, DIRTY!!! DIRTY!!! DIRTY!!! DIRTY!!! DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! CONSIDER OTHER PLACES!!!! To add insult to injury as of Feb 02 2010 they still had not processed the credit for the room. There was a beautiful charge of about $950 but surely no credit. This has been turned over to MasterCard at this point. Phone calls to Christina Lopez with several voicemails were never returned. Just prior to posting this I finally reached Christina…You guessed it more excuses. I was off sick… etc. etc. etc. It appears that this has finally been rectified but I will need to confirm with M/C.This is what comes to mind when I read the reviews. We stayed in Disney for the first 5 nights before changing to this hotel. It is on the less hectic end of I drive and has ample free parking. The saving grace if I had to choose one is how friendly the bell hops and housekeeping were. Now to the experience that we endured. We arrived at 1pm and had lunch while the room was not ready, no problem as we were early. I helped the bell hop store our luggage in one of the boardrooms and he handed me the ticket stubs for our bags. We had lunch in the hotel bar that was fine. We were then given our key and we checked into our suite on the 6th floor. One of the lifts on our side was out of order and remained so for a number of days. We only had one bed in the room and had requested a double when we booked through our travel agent. When I called the desk to enquire about changing rooms I was told that I was on the transfer list and to call down in the morning. They explained the hotel was full and we could not be moved that day. I was then told that my travel agent had "forced through the booking" and that is why we had only one bed. I called the travel agent the next morning and was advised the room was booked in January and this was not the case that it was booked last minute. We rang reception twice before our luggage finally arrived and we were told that the reason for the delay was that the bags were put into a room with guests who had the same surname. This was hard to accept as I had handed the stubs for the luggage to the receptionist as I took the room key. The stubs were numbered so why was the name on the case used? More concerning was the fact we were told that the mistake was only noticed when the luggage was spotted outside the room where it was delivered. Thankfully nothing was missing from the cases. They were put in the wrong room where they could easily have been gone through. One of the chairs in the room was covered in stains and was a disgrace. How housekeeping had left this in the room is beyond me. The next morning I dropped down to reception to see about moving to a room with two beds. I was met by a girl who was in full flow of enjoying her first juicy fruit of the day. The packet was on the desk in front of her for all to see. She continued to chew the gum throughout the conversation I had with her. I asked about been moved and she advised they were completely full. I then had to push her to ask when would a room become available as we were there for 11 nights. She told me it would be on Sunday and this was now a Thursday morning. I thanked her for the time and agreed to move rooms on the Sunday. I walked past the same person later that day and she was still chewing away. I went back to my room and rang down to reception to meet with either the manager or the duty manager. I was told to come down to reception where I sat down with the duty manager and told him about my experience for the first 24 hours in the hotel. We came to an agreement in relation to the room that was appreciated and the chair was replaced. He also took away a sample of what was found around the sink in the upstairs. We were moved on the Sunday and the staff moved everything for us and even checked the wardrobe for items we did not pack. Again very helpful. What really disappointed me was no one ever came near us again to see if the new room was okay or even a note in the door to wish us a pleasant stay for the remainder of our time in the hotel. The breakfast was ordinary and Denny's provided our breakfast for most of the stay. One of the lifts on ourside of the hotel was out of order for 3-4 days at the busiest times while we were there. A sign was eventually placed on the lift that it was out of order and then when it was fixed the sign was dumped behind the elevator for a day or so before been picked up. The rooms were big but the air con was leaking through the roof of our first room, as it did beside the bar in the downstairs area one afternoon. The outdoor pool was disgusting as were the splash pools surrounding the main pool. Full of bugs etc. A rat was disposed off on one of the afternoons that I was outside. We used the pool once and that was it. It was pretty small also. Managers drinks was a great idea however from the 3 or 4 nights we were part took no management came to the table to say hello. There is a shop on the ground floor and the movies at managers drinks time was a good idea to let the adults relax outside the room were the movie was been shown. The lines to get to the bar were sometimes long when only one person was manning the bar. This was longer if you ordered two beers and a soft drink as the staff member would have to take the drink to the table as they were not allowed to be seen to serve more then two dinks per person, even soft drinks! There were free ices at the freezer in the reception, the security guard enjoyed these. Watched him make a few trips one evening. If you are going to stay then request a room overlooking the front of the hotel. As I said before the team of guys you had outside the hotel were fantastic and are a credit to you. Management could learn a thing or two from them. This is at most a 2-3 star hotel. I look forward to getting a response form the manager as I did not have the pleasure of meeting him in person during the 11 night stay we had, at least a message on the phone during the stay would have been nice John to acknowledge the problems we had. After reading all the reviews on trip advisor before we left I was sure we were going to be well looked after unfortunately this was not the case. Wished we had never moved from our first hotel as we ended up in faulty towers with Basil nowhere to be seen.I was highly disappointed by their service and food.Carlsberg don't do hotels but if they did ... this would be the farthest thing from it. OK, before I begin what is most definitely going to become a "rant" I should mention the one good thing about the Hotel Carter. That would be its location; it’s in a fantastic place close to Times Square, the bus terminal and a short stroll to 5th Avenue. Ok, now for the "rant". I read a mixed bunch of reviews before I went on my trip about haunted rooms, thefts and it not being the best of hotels. But I thought "hey, I’ve stayed in some pretty cr*ppy places, how bad can it be?” Well let me tell you, it can be BAD!!!! We (my girlfriend and I) arrived at the Carter late on Thursday 14th December 2006. We were greeted as we opened the door by the delightful whiff of the greasy cafe that is, for reasons unknown, adjoined to the hotel entrance. As we climbed the hotels steps, tastefully decorated in Technicolor patterns, set off by the various tones of dirt, grime and trodden in chewing gum I took the opportunity to admire the strange dolls that are displayed in glass cabinets around the entrance. As I admired them, and the 3 working Christmas lights that surrounded them, I enjoyed the tasteful out-of-tune music that played in the background. I can only compare it to a musical Christmas card that was low on batteries. Not put off, my girlfriend and I made our way to the reception. The first thing that struck me about the reception area was the fact that it had clearly been designed to stop people leaping the counter and attacking the hotel staff. This being New York, I thought perhaps these sort of things happen. When I met our "Friendly" night receptionist, I soon learnt that all this security was in fact to keep her in. To say this woman was rude is an understatement. She had clearly attended the Adolf Hitler School of charm and passed with honours. After we received what I can only assume was the standard level of abuse and rudeness (and were charged for the pleasure) we made our way up to our room. We were on the 19th floor, and let me tell you a ride in the lift (which I believe was last serviced upon the buildings contraction) is an experience in itself. Will you make it? Won’t you make it? It’s all very exciting. When we got to the 19th floor hallway, the first thing that strikes you is the lighting or rather, lack there of. There is a 40 watt bulb once every 40ft, so its kind of like staying in a poorly lit multi-storey car park (but dirtier). We made our way to our room and arrived at our door that was tastefully decorated a nice shade of green/dirt with a few dents and smashes for good effect. On entering our room we saw that it was last cleaned some time in the mid thirties. The linen looked relatively fresh, except for a very suspicious stain, and the bathroom … well, lets just say if the room was cleaned in the mid thirties it was by a lazy cleaner who forgot to do the bathroom. But still, as I’ve said, I’ve stayed in some bad places and was not about to let a few decades of dirt, an abusive receptionist and dodgy lift put me off. I was in NEW YORK BABY … Having emptied our stuff into the spacious wardrobe (ooh another good point, sorry there was two) my girlfriend decided to have a quick wash before bed. As she did this I lay on the bed and decided to check out the wonder of American television. No sooner had I turned on the TV then came a yelp from the bathroom followed by the door opening and my girlfriend in fits of hysterical laughter. I walked over to see what was going on, when I noticed what was coming out of the taps. Now, I’m not too sure how to describe this but it was kind of like lumpy gravy with flecks of grey. Thankfully, we did have both hot a cold running versions of it. I was going to phone reception to complain when I remembered that this may mean I would anger the receptionist and god forbid, they set her free to come find me. So, we left the taps to run for 10 minutes or so and they did eventually run clear. So, I went back to my laying on the bed and watching TV when something caught my eye on the wall. I looked, and with the reviews of this being a “haunted hotel” ringing in my head, I saw a pentagram had been etched into the wall. Fan-bloody-tatstic! Immediately wanting to get this out of my mind I thought I go to the window, pull the curtains back, and have a look at New York by night. I was quite impressed with the 5 square foot of Times square I could make out from our window and watched the bits of HUGE advertising boards I could see light up and change. As I stood there, I became aware of my right leg starting to get cold. Assuming the ghost of the Carter had come to get me I slowly glimpsed down to take a look at it. But instead of a gruesome spectre I instead saw that there was a hole, about the size of my fist, in the wall leading directly to the outside world. I was all set to complain, when I realised there was actually a better view of Time Square from the hole than there was from my window. So that was my initial experience of the Carter, and frankly in the 2 nights that followed, it didn’t get any better. No doubt you are now reading this thinking “well if it was so bad why the hell didn’t you change hotels?” And the reason for that simply was we were there with another couple and the chances of getting 2 rooms on the weekend before Xmas were not good. Plus, I wouldn’t have been able to have such a good rant had I stayed somewhere different. So, in summary … would I stay at the Carter again? NO. Yes it is cheap, but not cheap enough to warrant the state the place is in or the rudeness of the staff. I would highly recommend more spending a bit extra and staying somewhere where you don’t need several inoculations before visiting.- I called the business center prior to our arrival to ask about having a package delivered to the hotel. She said that it was fine and we just need to go pick it up in the business center. When we went to pick it up, they charged us $9! What for? Oh, to sign for it. -When we checked into the hotel, the woman checking us in asked for a credit card and said that they wouldn't accept debit cards. She said “if you didn't like it, then you can leave and go somewhere else.” Then we're told that it's going to be $100 per night held on our card IN CASE WE BREAK THINGS! -Upon getting to our room, we saw that shampoo and conditioner were $24 EACH, and not included with the room! -We were told by the bell desk that the hours of the shuttle were 10am-6pm, and the driver confirmed this. They only go once per hour on the hour, and they only go to the fashion show mall. -We ended up leaving the Siegfried and Roy’s Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat early to make it to the last shuttle back to the hotel. We showed up, but it didn’t come. I called the hotel and was told that the last run was at 5pm. I told her that we were told twice that it was from 10-6, she just said that there was nothing she could do. We ended up getting a cab back to the hotel ($12). -On day 2, we were woken up at 6:30 by the crew out by the pool using a leaf blower. I called the front desk and she said that there was nothing they could do about it. Never mind that the paper thin walls had allowed us to hear everyone partying until the wee hours of the morning and we were now up at 6:30, there was nothing she could do and she honestly didn’t care. -That night, we asked about the shuttle, just so we could clear it up. Once again, we were told the hours were 10am-6pm. When I explained the issue we had the night before, the bell man acted like I was stupid. He said that of course there wasn’t a shuttle at 6pm, the guy who drives the shuttle is off work at 6pm! So when they say that it runs from 10am-6pm, they mean that there are shuttles from 10am-5pm. How stupid of me to not understand that! -On day three, (after being woken up at 6:30 by the leaf blower again) we spent the morning on the strip and later went down to the pool. The woman handing out towels was irritated that we interrupted her conversation with her cute male co-worker and all but threw the towels at us. There weren’t any lounge chairs available at the first pool area, so we went up to the second area with these big white cushioned ottomans and sat down. We were then kicked out because they have a $100 minimum and we hadn’t reserved it. There was nothing to indicate that we needed a reservation (it wasn’t a cabana). We ended up going over to the back pool and hung out there for a few hours. There was a cocktail waitress over there with long black hair that was working her butt off and very nice. Didn’t see her very often and drinks took forever to get to us, but that was because the other girls working that pool weren’t doing anything but flirting with the cute male guests. -That evening, we went back to the hotel and called the front desk to ask about the dress code for Skybar. It was about 10:50 when we called. The woman explained the dress code, and we headed down to have a few drinks. When we showed up, it was closed. Turns out, the hours are from 6-11pm. The book in the hotel room is so old that it doesn’t even list Skybar, and the woman at the front desk didn’t think to mention that it was closing in 10 minutes. -We ended up going to the lounge by the poker room. It took a while to get the bartender’s attention. Not because it was busy, but because he was preoccupied with his conversation with the cocktail waitress. He kept looking over at me, but continued to chat it up with his co-worker. -On the last day, we packed up our things, and went down to the front desk where we discovered that we had been charged almost $100 for the mini bar, even though we didn’t take a single thing. Turns out, it’s all on a weight system and if you even look through the mini fridge to see what there is, you’re charged for everything you move. -We were also charged $15 per day plus tax for their “resort fee” which apparently covers valet parking, self parking, the shuttle, access to the gym, towels for the pool, and the phone in the room. That seems a little steep considering we used 2 towels, and rode the shuttle 3 times. -We still had 7 hours until our flight, so we headed out to catch the first shuttle to the strip at 10am. It never came. The old outdated shuttle had broken down and so we were stuck sitting there unless we wanted to pay for a cab. So much for the $15 resort fee which covers shuttle service!Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Mediocre We just finished staying for 11 days in December at the Marriott Marquis. It actually didn't meet nor exceed our expectations, which is, we feel, pitiful for the price. It feels as if you're staying in a nice hotel, rather than a great hotel. For most, it would feel indifferent.For its price (it cost us a whopping $10,000+ USD for our entire stay), it should feel a lot better than 'nice'. Amongst the 2002 rooms, you feel like a robot, especially seeing as you quickly realise that the Marquis is heavily biased towards their business customers. This feels overwhelmingly like a businessmen hotel, and you'll meet many of them as you go up and down the elevators.The hotel is overpriced, even for a hotel ($7 bottled water connected to actual sensors that bill your account if they are off the stand for more than 30 seconds) and $117 USD for a sickening in-room breakfast for 2 adults and a child.Another example.. it cost just over $16 for one 4-second call to Australia to ask a family member to call us back.The hotel is also happy to overcharge. You can either decide to challenge it or not. They will pretend that these charges are natural.Being a beginner to New York, you believe that a hotel in the middle of Times Square screams convenience and taste. While this is in some ways true, you quickly realise that a hotel a couple of blocks down, off broadway or at least out of times square could save you several thousands, for simply having to walk an extra 5 minutes. I must stress this.A Times Square hotel also sounds inviting to those who are looking for a view, but from our 36th-floor high room which we payed extra for, we had a spectacular view of the back of a bland building (yes, I'm being sarcastic).The hotel is as deceiving as possible.. it forgets to mention the (just over) $80 USD tax it charges (PER DAY), $3 per day OCC/JAV charge, it charges $16.95 per day for internet if you request it - but upon scanning for WiFi hotspots, they were plentiful from our room, including the hotel's own WiFi hotspot (in essence.. don't bother paying for internet), and the hotel held $5000 on our credit card (followed by more) from the first day we stayed here.Another problem.. cable/satellite television quit working for the entire hotel several times during our stay, staying offline for several hours - especially in the mornings. Speaking of television, we couldn't find any ports to plug in our cameras to view our video and photos we had taken for the day, and the speakers are located in an awkward position, leaving sound muffled.But while the cable was down, we had enormous fun watching the hotel's 3 self-advertisement channels (there's that sarcasm again.. but hey, they do actually have their own advertisement channels.. and the actors are all business men and women..)On arrival, they had forgotten to leave our New York, New York and A Taste of Starbucks packages in the room, but they were reasonably quick in bringing it up. We ordered this from the last-minute soliciting e-mail they send you before your stay. I've gotta say, it's not worth it at all. Save your money.The hotel isn't big on details, nor guiding those who are new here.. we paid extra for a Stay for breakfast package, which entitled us (we quickly learned the 4 year old is counted as a party, so only two adults would be able to eat, or one adult and the child) to paid-for breakfast each morning.Upon checking in, we were asked what breakfast option we would like, and were invited to pay an extra $100 per day. They weren't clear on the options, so we just stuck to what we had paid for. One morning, we went down to Encore (naturally, being the only restaurant serving breakfast.. though, we weren't told this) and entered the restaurant, not knowing exactly how to use our package. We asked a desk clerk, who asked for our room number. 'Over there', we were instructed. We were seated, and given a menu. This was confusing because I had thought we paid for a buffet. I wasn't sure whether to serve ourself or wait for someone to come over to us. After some confusion, we quit, and left to get some easy breakfast. This isn't a hotel for the inexperienced. We rang the front desk and asked if we could quit or exchange our breakfast portion of the package.. they denied both requests.Security is also inconsistent.. They have fairly useless doormen and greeters (greeting you sometimes) who also seem to act as some sort of low-level security. They also have what looks to be a security desk that doesn't seem to do a lot, other than likely looking for obvious madmen running around with guns. One night, when returning, everyone was required to show their keycards to use the elevators to go up. This was the only real security we've faced, but at the same time it was also inconvenient and felt odd considering it was only on that night. I'm not sure if this is because of a security incident in the hotel or because they just felt like it.We also learned on the 7th night that you should actually key in your floor number into the elevator system for each person (for instance, type '36' three times if there is three of you going to that floor). I'm sure no one does this, but this is what should be done to apparently have their system work optimally.The hotel unfortunately does nothing to make you feel as if your money has been well spent. This is not luxury.. it is just a nice hotel in an excellent location. And that's something that you actually DO NOT need (or at least, do not need to pay this much for). Don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise.This hotel is a nice treat for all of the businesses paying for their employees to a stay here... but it's an excellent waste of the business's money, from that standpoint.One last note which has been covered in other reviews.. the ambience, design and feel of the hotel in public areas isn't what we expected. It just isn't that great, especially seeing as it's Christmas. Bland best describes it.I would seriously consider my other options next time. This is just an honest review and 2 cents from 2 different adult travelers sharing a room (with a child).It's too hard to consider the few good points about the hotel when you're being ripped off daily.The nicest experience we had in this hotel was actually our friendly housekeeper, who we accordingly gave good tips to. (Thank you Hesena).Other minor problems? Power outlets were flimsy, the toilet clogs easily, the coffee machine didn't work, the remote control for the TV gave up and we found a woman's nail on the floor.The best part of our deal at the hotel is that we joined their membership program and asked for airline points, rather than Marriot reward points. Phew!Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!.Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes "just like" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is "natural" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to "optimize" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's "optimized" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to "optimize." (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under "Todd O'Connor". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by "Todd O'Connor" and under Alio "Alio"s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio "Alio" confirming the fake identity.)The following is correspondence sent to the Crowne Plaza Chicago Metro's corporate management (IHG) regarding a stay I experienced back in May. Despite sending the original complaint on June 4 with follow-up on July 26 and August 18, I still have not received what was promised to me. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I recently completed a three-night stay with a large group at the Crowne Plaza Chicago Metro. While I am not a top-tier Platinum PC member, I am a Gold PC member and was disappointed in multiple facets of my stay which I will outline below. â€¢ At check-in, I was assigned to a â€œKing Petiteâ€� room (though nothing in my booking indicated such). When I asked if a standard King room was available, I was told that the hotel was completely sold out. This was at 1:30 in the afternoon. A rack of approximately 40 portfolios that had not yet checked-in was clearly visible. Am I to believe that all of those portfolios were higher-level Platinum members, Double rooms and/or King Petites as well? Frankly, it seemed that the desk clerk was too lazy to be bothered. He did offer to exchange my room the next day if something came available. But why wasnâ€™t program status even considered when making the dayâ€™s room assignments to begin with? â€¢ The room I received was cramped. It honestly felt like a New York City hotel room. Granted the furnishings had been updated but this is a small consolation if the facility itself is uncomfortable. I needed to go out for a couple of hours and stopped by the front desk to reiterate my displeasure after seeing the room. I told the desk clerk that I was not unpacked and would be willing to relocate if there were cancellations. The desk clerk said he would let me know. I asked him if he remembered my name. He did not and then asked for my room number (a sure indication that he intended to do nothing in the first place since he hadnâ€™t recorded it earlier). I was never contacted again by the desk clerk or management. â€¢ Climate control in this room was lacking. Despite repeated attempts to adjust the temperature, the room maintained the constant feel and smell of a high school locker room. Notably there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom which likely contributes to this odor. â€¢ I should also mention that the â€œfree high speed internetâ€� is anything but high speed. The connection failed constantly, both wired and wirelessly. Fortunately, my smartphone and IPad were able to fill the void where the internet service failed. Of course this meant that I could not send work files from my laptop as needed. â€¢ The next morning I awoke to no hot water. I called downstairs to the front desk to inquire. An exasperated operator cut me off mid-sentence. Apparently, there was none for the entire hotel. At least I got to take a cold shower in a small, cramped bathroom. **sigh** The lack of hot water must have had an impact on the hotelâ€™s laundry as well. When my room was cleaned for the day, the used towels were removed. However, they were not replaced. Itâ€™s a good thing I had one set remaining. The standard provision of three towel sets wasnâ€™t restored until the following dayâ€™s cleaning. Oddly enough, a friend who was also staying in the hotel said he received extra towels that day. Perhaps "petite" isn't only a reference to the room, but the maintenance of its amenities as well. â€¢ On Saturday evening (approximately 9-9:30 p.m.), I ate dinner at the on-site restaurant. I was alone, was seated in the dining room and given the â€œbar menuâ€� (limited late evening offerings). I ordered a simple grilled ham & cheese sandwich with french fries. While waiting, I observed my surroundings. A male-female couple were seated and offered the bar menu as well as the full dinner menu. Another couple (male-male) were seated and offered the limited bar menu. A single male diner was seated and was also given the bar menu. Finally, a group of four (two men, two women) were seated and given the full dinner menu. Must a lady be seated at your table in order to eat from the full dinner menu? I should also note that all four of these tables received their meals before I did. Thirty minutes later, my sandwich and fries arrived; hot but still last in line despite being first to order. â€¢ At check-out, I was greeted by the front desk clerk and asked if â€œeverything on my bill was o.k.â€� Indeed, the billing was about the only thing on this stay that was done right. Since the clerk so carefully worded her inquiry and avoided asking me how my stay was, I decided to cut my losses and write this location off as â€œnever againâ€�. By now youâ€™re probably asking why I didnâ€™t engage a manager. Given the multiple areas of failure, it seems that the problem lies at the top of this propertyâ€™s food chain. Frankly, I felt that I would be wasting my time listening to hollow apologies. Regardless, I am frustrated and angered to the point that I need to let someone know. If you look at my membership file, you will see that I have curtailed my stays at IHG properties considerably, despite logging approximately 100 nights in hotels per year. This is due to the lack of consistency in the IHG brands and indifference to my loyalty. My recent stay at the Crowne Plaza Chicago Metro only reinforces that stance -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wrote to IHG giving them the opportunity to respond. They of course forwarded my list of complaints to the hotel and had Ron Shelton (Assistant General Manager) contact me. He offered apologies (what else is he going to do?), 15,000 points and an email of apology from the General Manager. Eleven weeks passed with no points nor apology from the General Manager. After emailing IHG twice more, I received 10,000 points from the hotel (5,000 less than originally promised) but still no email from the General Manager. Frankly, these points have no value to me as I have no intent to stay with IHG again. Still, I'm fighting on principle as Crowne Plaza should deliver on its promises. If it weren't for my group having chosen this hotel, I would have stayed elsewhere. Regardless, next year I will stay independently if our group books the same hotel.The absolute worst service I've ever experienced and the food was below average (when they actually gave people the meals they ordered).My husband and I stayed 2 nights in this hotel. It started badly with the taxi driver dumping us and our luggage on first street. My husband left me on the sidewalk with the luggage to get someone to help us with our stuff. He returned with a luggage cart. The guys inside had told him they could not come down to the corner of the street, but had given him the cart - something they weren't allowed to, but did anyways. So we pushed our luggage up the sidewalk to the hotel, where the guys took over. Great! We checked in with a guy who was not overjoyed to see us. He told us he had upgraded us to a superior corner room with the best view, non-smoking. My husband had forgotten to add non-smoking when he booked the hotel (there was no button there, you need to add this in your comment it seems) so he emailed twice asking them to mark our room non-smoking with no reply from them. It sounded nice to be upgraded, so we were cheery. We had also requested a room as high as possible which we did not get. We were still in the lower floors, though it was high enough in the end. Just not what we had specifically asked for. We then went to the elevator and got upstairs. The hallways wiped the cheery smiles off our faces quickly. There was red tape all over the floor, where the brownish carpet had been ripped. We were all the way down the hall and entered our room which was very hot. We turned the AC to its coldest and it did send out cool air, but the window shades had been up all day, so the sun had heated the room up to over 80 degrees - despite the AC. We lowered the shades right away, which helped a little. The view really was pretty good, though to see Empire State Building and Chrysler Building we had to almost lean out of the window - which was impossible, because the window does not open. We had chosen that hotel especially because we saw that you could open the window. It didn't matter much, but, the windows were really dirty, both from in- and outside. I went to the bathroom and was shocked by the state of the bathroom! The sink was sitting inside a glass surrounding, but that was totally cracked! I always feared it would fall apart while I was in there. The big mirror next to the toilet was dirty and chipped on the upper part. The floor tiles were chipped or cracked - at least 50% of them were not in one piece anymore. It didn't happen to us, but on those chipped tiles you can easily cut your foot open when you walk with bare feet. The walls were heavily stained, even some browning liquid had trickled down the wall in one place. Not a big thing, but still: ICKY! Don't wanna know what that was. My husband took a shower - only to bathe his feet almost up to his knees because the drain worked so poorly. The bathroom had no working fan/ vent. For the 2 of us there was only 1 washcloth in total. I called housekeeping and they told me it would take them 10 - 15 minutes at least to bring some up. 20 minutes later I had 3 extra wash clothes. (Not the newest, but they seemed clean.) There is a high headboard above the bed and there was a big thing of dust looking down at me when I was in bed. I was not very happy with the room, so I got out our reservation and found out we had not been upgraded at all! The room we were in was exactly what we had booked and paid for - only thing was non-smoking and that can hardly be an upgrade! In the morning, it got really hot again, even though the shades had been down straight away. I went to complain to the front desk. The lady there never even said she was sorry. I had written a long list of things we didn't find alright and by the time I had gotten to number 3 she wasn't even listening to me. She asked me to leave the list with her to give to the housekeeping manager. That apparently did happen, because the stains had been cleared off the bathroom walls and the windows had been cleaned from the inside. The plug in the tub had been replaced. Of course, the tiles, the mirror and the sink would have needed big time construction and that we would not have liked within our 2 night stay. The dust was also still looking at me. The tip we had left in the hope to get a cleaner room was left untouched. So, all in all there was some improvement, but it was not what we had expected, wanted or had to pay for. My husband checked out and told the next guy at the front desk about all our complaints again. The guy said he was sorry for our inconvenience and said all he could do with the room rate was not charge the internet we had used on one of our 2 days. So that was a big disappointment in the end. The only person who managed to get a tiny smile on our face was Ozzy, because he was really nice and treated us as we would have expected by any one of those people in the hotel. As guests and the people who pay their salary.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.So we sat at the bar, the bartender didn't seem like he wanted to be there.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning.

Some things we experienced:*Front desk very slow..........long lines to check in. Desk clerks spoke almost NO English, and very difficult to get their attention. Finally got to our room, to find it was not in the area/room I paid for. Returned to desk..........again, in line for about an hour........to be finally told that they were overbooked, and there was nothing they could do. We returned to our room, and I called Travelocity (a $45 call).....the Travelocity rep tried to be helpful, even 3-waying us into a call with the desk manager. We went back to the desk, and as we approached, David the manager we had spoken with, ran out the back door. When we asked to speak with him, we were told that he was not there. Checked with them several times during the week about a room change, which never happened.*The room.............nasty. Smelled mildewed, not very clean. Bedspreads were dirty. Slate shower cracked, moldy-smelling, and had a huge leak out to the rest of the bathroom. Toilet had virtually no flushing pressure; our toilet clogged every day. We returned from a day at the beach once to find the toilet bowl full of poop (not ours!!). It, of course, didn't flush, and we waited for 3 hours (including several calls and a trip to the desk) for this to be remedied. There was a hole above the sink which leaked dirty water onto the sink area; a steady stream when it rained (showers at night). The closet was moldy, and leaked heavily during rains...enough to pour out into the room. The floor of the room was constantly wet. Difficult to get clean towels.*The food...........tiresome. There are two buffets, only one is open for all 3 meals.....and it is the SAME FOOD EVERY DAY!!!!!!!!!!! Neither my daughter or I eat seafood or red meat, so we were outta luck with lunches and dinners. Did eat a lot of fresh fruit, which we liked. There are 3 other choices for dinner: a Mexican buffet (lots of mystery meat), a Japanese restaurant, which was delicious, and a Caribbean-style, which was delicious. Other than that, there are 2 other options: a pizza place (ick...the flies), and an outdoor grill on the beach..........serving the same thing every day..........hamburgers and fries, occasionally lettuce and tomatoes. All eateries except the Caribbean one are outdoors, or at least unenclosed from the outside. Thus, birds and bugs visited the buffets.......... buffets are pretty much a free-for-all, with adults and children alike pawing through the food (literally...bare hands!), eating off the serving trays, breathing and coughing all over the food, serving utensils, etc. People's manners were quite appalling. We resorted to safe foods.....individual yogurts, bananas, oranges. The natives..........for the most part, very welcoming.....we found that tipping regularly was VERY appreciated, and provided excellent customer service. These people are so poor....they appreciate the tips, especially with US dollars! The animation staff was fun........amazingly these young people spoke 6 or 7 different languages!! They are very willing to involve visitors in dance lessons, exercise classes, or just conversation.The tourists............very, very few Americans. Mostly European tourists, and we met some folks from Russia, Canada. One thing that really grossed us out was the fact that nearly ALL the tourists smoked. It seemed we we constantly breathing in second-hand smoke. They seemed to have no etiquette or consideration with their smoking...........they'd blow smoke right at you, on the beach, or while eating. RUDE RUDE RUDE. Lots of cigarette butts in the beach sand (yuck). If you are a nonsmoker, this will definitely disgust you.The beach.............the water was gorgeous!! Clean, clear, and deliciously warm. You can see right down to the bottom, even in very deep water. There is no surf here because of the reef.Very enjoyable playing and swimming. The sand on the beach is so soft and fine...almost like confectioner's sugar. The workers work hard to keep the sand clean, but they just can't keep up with all the piggy people who feel they can use it as a dump. The beach is littered with lazy tourist's crap.........discarded plastic cups, styrofoam plates, empty cigarette packs, condom wrappers (!), and lots and lots of cigarette butts. One morning I laid my towel down on the chaise, only to find it smeared with fresh [-].I could go on, but I think you get the point.............If you are going to take the time and spend the money to go to Punta Cana, PLEASE cough up the extra $200-300 bucks and go to a decent hotel!!!!Lisa  RaechelThe only drawback is that it's a little pricey.I called this hotel's reservations center directly and made one reservation for two adults. One confirmation was submitted to my email address; and after finding a different hotel I preferred to stay at during my visit to Orlando, I canceled my reservation through the link attached to the inital confirmation in the appropriate time I was given to avoid any charges being made to my credit card; and I was issued an cancellation number. While driving on the Florida turnpike (from Michigan) the day following the arrival date I was initally supposed to have checked in, a female from this hotel called my cell phone inquiring if I was still arriving at their hotel (sounded pretty desperate to me for business). I informed the individual that I had canceled the reservation and had a cancellation number in my email account and I was driving on the highway and that I needed to remain focused since traffic was somewhat congested. Nevertheless, she goes on to inform me that they (the hotel) didn't have a cancellation for me. I once again informed her that she was calling my cell phone while I was driving on the highway; and she goes on to inquire if I could forward the cancellation to her email address. DUH? What part of I am driving on the highway didn't she understand? I then informed her that when I arrived to where I was going, I would print the cancellation and bring it to her. She then goes on to ask me if I were in the Orlando area? DUH AGAIN! How many times had I informed her that I was driving on the highway enroute to this area? Anyways, when I arrived to the beautiful resort I elected to stay in, I was extremely exhausted being that I was the only driver in my vehicle; so, I checked in, showered and went to sleep. The following day, I had a strict schedule to adhere to and was not able to take the canceled reservation to this hotel; so, I wait until the next day, open my email and OMG, I have an email from this hotel asking me to submit to a survey for a one night stay. Huh? Immediately, I decided to check my bank account and discovered this hotel had charged me for a one night stay subsequent to me informing their representative that I had canceled the reservation; so, here comes the good part. When I arrive at the hotel with my canceled reservation, I am told that I made two reservations? Huh? Whoever I initially spoke to when making the reservation obviously has a hearing problem because I informed the reservation agent that I was making one (1) reservation for two (2) adults. Why did she list on my reservation I had a party of four (4) adults? Then, the front desk tells me that I made the reservation online. I told the woman that I did not make the reservation online, I called directly into the hotel because had I made the reservation online, I would have made it through my Gold Points account and this reservation was not in my Gold Points account; and that she could open my account to verify it. Then, she tells me that I made two reservations under the same confirmation number. If this were true, then, when I canceled the one reservation, the other reservation should have canceled also. Hmm, this seems correct to me. Okay, I was seeing how desperate they were in thinking I was going to yield to allowing them to keep money from my account that they had already fraudulently charged me for; so, I stood my grounds with informing them that I did NOT make two reservations; and they stood there toying with their system until I pulled out my cell phone and called my bank in their presence. All of sudden, the IGNORANT front desk manager tells the billing representative to refund my money because they didn't want to continue dealing with the issue. This raised a concern with both me and the representative from my bank (who heard her) and I reported the matter to the FRAUD department at my bank because it was very obvious that this hotel doubles the reservation on people who cancels their reservation as a measure of charging the customer for at least one night when the customer decides not to stay at their hotel. They stood in my face and told so many LIES, it was both pathetic and unprofessional. Had I made the reservation online, why would I list my name as Mrs. when that is not my appropriate title? Why wouldn't the reservation be listed in my Gold Points account? Why would I make a reservation for four adults when I was only traveling with my daughter? Why wouldn't I choose the AAA rate opposed to their best available rate (which is always higher)? BE CAREFUL WHEN MAKING RESERVATIONS DIRECTLY WITH THIS HOTEL BECAUSE IF YOU CHOOSE TO CANCEL, TEN TIMES OUT OF TEN, YOU'RE GOING TO BE PENALIZED FOR DECIDING NOT TO STAY AT THEIR HOTEL WHEN THERE ARE OTHER HOTELS THAT ARE MORE QUALITATIVE THAN THEIRS! I'm sure the majority of all of these GOOD REVIEWS are made by hotel employees. Nothing is perfect; and I have come to discover that this hotel actually is pitiful! I would suggest to anyone to sustain your cancellation number because if you don't, it is their word against yours and ten times out of ten, you will not get your money back. Now, this is a primary example of how businesses seek to take advantage of consumers in these extreme economic times. How pathetic! I wouldn't suggest this hotel to no one, even if they paid me to do it! UNPROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES EQUATE TO UNPROFESSIONAL BUSINESS...ATTEMPTED RIP OFF!I stayed for more than 9 nights and spent over $7,000.00. There was no booze and no entertaining. I only had one spa treatment. I had a city view room (lower priced than harbor view) on the gold concierge level. I was with a large conference and would have checked out the same day I arrived but for the fact that the hotels in the vicinity of the conference were completely booked. At the Airport: The hotel booked transportation from the airport to the hotel. Their contract limo service could not find the hotel. After the second pass where I kept seeing the sign and telling the driver he had driven past it, he finally got me there. Then he did not how to get the doors unlocked and took about six tries as the hotel doorman is desperately trying to get me out. I could not get the door handle to release. That’s for starters. Recommendation for airport transfer to hotel: Make your own reservation for a sedan service. The taxis, unfortunately, are very hit or miss as to their competence. Check into a bus or sky train transfer. Check-in and Lobby Atmosphere: When you walk in the hotel in the late afternoon you are greeted by a loud wall of sound from an off-key singer in the lobby. It is so loud that one can hardly hear what reception is saying. I had to ask reception to repeat several times. It was so loud it hurt my ears. This seems to be the way the hotel runs its PA system. If you book a regular room, you get to go to the reception at the front lobby. If you book a Fairmont Gold room, you get to stand in line at reception at the front lobby and then stand in line for a second time at the Fairmont Gold check-in on the 20th floor. Odd isn’t it? Well, it gets more odd. Recommendation for Check-in: There is nothing you can do to avoid their check-in problems. The cost: When I checked in, the hotel had switched my reservation without my consent to a more expensive room charge. I caught it and my room was changed immediately. The Room: Lights: A computer that fails regularly and has to be re-set even twice a day, controls every light in the room. I was standing in the bathroom one evening and every light in the entire room went out leaving me in pitch darkness. I could not get the lights in the bathroom to completely turn off. The significance of it is that the door to the bathroom is glass. So, the light from the bathroom kept the beds lit up all night. The engineer for the hotel told me that he and his wife were required to stay in the hotel when it first opened. Same thing happened to him. It took him three months to get an answer from the manufacturer of the light system. And that answer doesn’t always work. You have to know the combination of LED’s to hit just right or it won’t go out. The light by the bed: When you want to turn on all the lights in the room-it just won’t work. If you try to turn on the light by itself, the light will turn on and then just turn off by itself!!! Try again! And when a light is off, you cannot see the writing on the led switch plate to determine which of the myriad of buttons will turn on the light. I put a book in front of the LED lights to get the room darker at night and had some ultra-bright LED’s taped over by the engineer. The window does open. But the gasket around the window keeps fresh air from entering the room The slightest sound in the hall could be heard in my room. I could have used more drawer space. The showerhead in the shower keeps sliding out of your hands and is just plain difficult. More noise: Seaplane traffic and the room: This hotel’s premium rooms face the harbor and are only a couple of hundred feet from the water’s edge. Directly across from the rooms is the take-off and landing zone for Canada’s busiest float plane airport and one of the busiest in the world. People commute to their jobs via floatplane. With poorly soundproofed windows and flights taking off from DAWN and landing through dusk, this is not a relaxing place to be let alone get a decent night’s sleep when you have early meetings or want to sleep in on the weekend. Requests for meals: I made requests for meals and found it very difficult to get the hotel to comply. The hotel’s description of their menu items is not complete and were an unhappy surprise to me time after time. For example, the hotel lists on its menu that it has steel cut oatmeal that has brown sugar and raisins on the side. What it does not tell you is that the oatmeal is pre-sweetened and pre-flavored. And even when I requested that the oatmeal be plain, it prepared it with the pre-sweetener and pre-flavoring. I finally had to tell them no pre-sweetener, no pre-flavoring, no milk and prepared with just plain hot water to get “plain oatmeal.” It took several days to work this out with the kitchen. This did not make for happy breakfasts during the first part of my stay. Another example is where the kitchen had written instructions from the chef to not include cheese in any of my orders. The kitchen ignored the chef’s written instructions. When the kitchen will not follow their executive chef’s written instructions, I felt quite helpless in dealing with them myself. I would also like to note that because the hotel made me make all my requests through room service, I had to pay a room service charge plus gratuity for every meal no matter where in the hotel I ate the meal. Transportation: I asked the Gold concierge to not to book me with the same limo service that brought me from the airport. When I needed another sedan and driver, they booked me with the same limo service. The driver was late and could not find the restaurant. When I used the complimentary hotel car service, it was late. Laundry: Don’t believe what is written on the laundry list that your laundry will be back BY 6:00 p.m. mine wasn’t back until 9:00 PM. The laundry department has contracted with an outside service that was NEVER returning laundry BY 6:00 PM unless you paid 50% more for express service. In addition, things that should have been pressed were not pressed. Gold Concierge Service: I was told, with a sneer, by one of the Gold concierges that the reason that the hotel was not operating very well was that the hotel was full of people from my profession. I believe the Gold concierges are inexperienced. ATM Machine: The hotel’s ATM machine accepts very few foreign cards. The one good department in the hotel is the housekeeping that cleans the rooms. The rooms were clean and the staff cleaning the rooms was good. Swimming pool is on the 6th floor and outdoors. It was quite chilly to get out of the heated pool and be in the wind. The pool could be 1-2 degrees warmer. I did not use the hot tub. It was adequate for laps. The other people using the pool were courteous.Never again! Trust the reviews!!! Just returned from a one week vacation at the Occidental Grand Flamenco with my fiancee. Wish we knew of tripadvisor before we booked - never would have gone - trust the reviews. We have been to Punta Cana several times before and have traveled to many other places, including the Bahamas, Jamaica and Aruba - we know what to expect. If you gave us a free vacation, including air fare and $500 spending money, to return to the Occidental, we would turn it down without hesitation. Now the review:Check in: - No organization, just chaos. After a 40 minute wait just to speak with someone at the desk, our room was not ready. No big deal, it was 2:45PM - return at three. We did get our wrist bracelets and headed for the bar. 3PM - not ready! 3:30PM - not ready! 4PM - not ready! 4:15PM - not ready! 4:30PM was assigned room 323 in building 26 - as we were told - that is a nice room with an ocean view. We headed to the room - and walked and walked and walked. Finally we reached building 26. The view was of a walkway and a children鈥檚 playground - no ocean. Looked for the safe deposit box. Found one in the closet and saw the lock missing. Was never informed at the desk that you have to pay $25 for the lock. Went back to the desk to change to a building closer to the main area. Assigned building 11 room 223. The only positive about this building was that it was closer to the main area. This room has seen better days many, many years ago. The room had two full size beds pushed together. Broken bulb and broken glass on shelf in closet. Knobs missing from closet door. Sliding glass doors to balcony had broken locks and could not be secured - had to jam a table between them for security. No towels in the bathroom - finally received two bath towels - no hand towels or face cloths. No water pressure and many times no water at all. Toilet would not properly flush - took up to five times just to get it to work properly. Noticed all of the toilets were like this in the public areas - it was disgusting. Linen was never changed.Pool was nice and appeared clean. Lounge chairs were a hassle. Want a pool towel? Don't bother to look for a towel hut by the pool. Get ready to walk and walk and walk - all the way to the beach - a good 15 minute walk round trip. You want to have a pool towel already in your room there is a catch - I will tell you later on what the catch is - no it's not tipping. Food - Buffet was ok - not great by any means. Food at many times was cold. Restaurants - 4 or 5 of them where you need to book reservations - 6:30 sitting or 9:30PM. Don't waste your time - tried the steak restaurant - small salad buffet. Main course - waiter comes with a skewer with sausage on it - not tasty. Next skewer - dried chicken. Third and last skewer - steak??? Another waiter dropped a small saucer with one small carrot, one small piece of broccoli, and literally a 1/4 cup of rice - that plate was for two. Italian restaurant - stayed 10 minutes - went to the buffet. Premium liquor - in the evening they set up a stand in the lobby where you can purchase premium liquor drinks. Paid $7.00 for an Amaretto and OJ. Gave me a glass with the Amaretto - where's the OJ ?- You have to walk to the bar to get it鈥?That is a class act. I'm a born and bred New Yorker - don't expect a lot, but not this kind of service.Service - 90% of the staff are not friendly. There is no reaction, no greetings. As I have said in the beginning, I travel, and this is the worst employee interaction I ever experienced. It seemed to my fiancee and I that many of the wait staff despised the guests they were serving. I am a very friendly and outgoing guy. Went to my bank before my vacation to get a lot of small bills of tens, fives, and ones for extra tips. Came back with almost all of it. Beach was nice - just don't go in the restricted area that is reserved for special guests. Went to the beach bar - ordered two drinks - the female bartenders started to laugh. Wrong color wrist bracelet - that was the special guests bar. Where's the bar for the common folk? - Pointed to the other end of the beach. Walked and walked. Told my girl to pull up stakes and move down to the far end of the beach - by the common folks bar.Pool towels - want one in your room. Here's the catch - On Monday when I was looking for the towels I asked an employee that was wearing a white shirt with a name tag. He was very nice and said he would walk us to where the towels were. On the way he talked on how we could have booked this vacation without the travel agent, get better rooms with the towels already in them, and save a ton of money by booking direct with Occidental. He would give me the information the next day. Being from NY I do not trust anyone and figured out that it will probably be a time share type deal. The next day he saw us coming from breakfast - I asked him what the real deal was - He stated he was a chance for a vacation club and pleaded with us just to go upstairs so he could get his points. For the humor factor I went upstairs. Wanted to take a picture of us to put on a bottle of liquor free. No thank you. Please fill out this questionnaire. No. Introduced to a salesman - Straight out I asked what are you selling and what it costs. Vacation club that includes an annual maintenance fee. Would not tell me the cost because I refused to sit and listen to the pitch. Left after 5 minutes. How funny is it that the friendliest people were the ones trying to sell you a piece of the Occidental. Now I see that that they make it difficult for the common folk so you can upgrade, for a big price, to better accommodations and service. Service and accommodations that should be expected from the start for all of the people - not just the special guests. Will never return to the Occidental or any of their hotels or resorts. First impression is a lasting one.I booked the Park Central New York after looking at several hotels in midtown Manhattan that were close to Carnegie Hall. I booked a concierge room with a king size bed from Wednesday, June 11, 2008 - Monday, June 16, 2008. From the pictures on the website, the hotel looked comfortable and clean. When I arrived at the hotel, it seemed hot in the lobby but I figured that it was just me because I had been walking with all of my luggage. When I got to the room, I realized that it wasn't me. The air conditioning was out in the room. The fan was on in the air conditioning unit, but it was blowing out air that was room temperature (which was easily 90 degrees). I spoke with the lady at the front desk about the lack of air conditioning in my room and I asked her if I could be moved. She stated that the air conditioning was out in the entire hotel so it would do no good to be moved. I asked her when the air would be fixed and she said that she had no idea. She went on to say that the air had been out for over a week and they are just taking it day-to-day at this point. The temperature in the hotel was the topic of conversation for every guest that I encountered in the elevators and the lobby. People were checking out of this hotel as quickly as they could. Although I was uncomfortable, I tried to make the best of it and see if I could sleep in the room. Due to the high temperature and the fact that there was absolutely no air circulation, I was not able to fall asleep for hours. I lay in bed most of the night sticking to the sheets, tossing and turning in vain to find a cooler spot. By the next morning, I realized that I was not going to be able to stay in this hotel for 4 more days. So, I checked on the Wellington Hotel across the street. They had air conditioning that worked and the rooms were clean and comfortable and they were over $100 less per night than the rooms at the Park Central New York. So, I checked in at the Wellington on Thursday, June 12, 2008 and checked out from the Park Central New York on the same afternoon. When I told the gentleman at the front desk of the Park Central New York that I was checking out due to the air conditioning, he said that he understood. Then, he told me that the hotel would be charging me for my entire reservation with the exception of Sunday night. My original reservation was for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I was checking out on Thursday afternoon and the gentleman at the front desk actually said the hotel was going to charge me for 4 nights that I was not sleeping in the hotel. I couldn't believe it. I demanded to speak to the hotel manager and stated that I wasn't going to be paying. The gentleman at the front desk went back to speak with his manager and then came back to tell me that the hotel would not charge me for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. However, they were still going to charge me for Wednesday and Thursday night. I still couldn't believe that they were going to charge me for a night that I had not stayed. Then, I saw the rate that they intended to charge me. They were charging me $400/night. When I had booked the room on the website, I had booked a concierge room. The website has a promotion where you get 20% if you stay for 5 or more nights. The total reservation came to $1,700 for 5 nights. I could not understand how the hotel was now charging me $853 for just 2 nights. I told the gentleman at the front desk that I was not even given a concierge room with a king size bed as I had requested in my reservation because one was not available when I checked in at 7:30 PM on Wednesday night. He went back to speak with his manager about my rate and stated that they would take $100 off of my charge for Thursday night. So, my final bill for staying in this hotel for 1 night in a room that was not air conditioned and did not have a king size bed as reserved and was not a concierge room as reserved was $753. This is complete and total highway robbery. I would also like to mention that the wireless Internet in the room I stayed in was not working and neither were 3 out of the 5 lamps in the room. I would also like to mention that the linens on the beds were stained with what looked like dried blood. There was no bellhop to assist us with our luggage when we checked in either. The elevators were extremely slow, but the hotel has signs up that say that they are renovating the elevators. From the dust on those signs, I would say that they have been up for months. After having such a bad experience with the Park Central New York, I contacted my parents and my sister and her husband who were planning to check into the Park Central New York the next day. I told them to cancel their reservations immediately because the hotel had no air conditioning and because of the horrible service. They cancelled their reservations 24 hours before they arrived, but the Park Central New York still charged them for their entire 2-day reservations. My family is now going through the chargeback process with their banks to have these charges reversed. I would like to mention that I checked into the Wellington Hotel across the street from the Park Central New York hotel on Thursday afternoon. The room there was extremely clean and comfortable, my room was larger, had an Italian marble bathroom, a walk-in closet, an incredible view of Times Square and my total bill for a 4 night stay was only $1,052. It is hard to believe that the Park Central New York would act like they did and charge what they did when there is a better hotel that costs less money directly across the street. Frankly, I'm surprised that the Park Central New York hotel is even still in business. My advice to anyone who is planning on staying at the Park Central New York hotel is to stay at the Hotel Wellington. You'll be much more comfortable there and pay less money for your stay and there is absolutely no difference in the geographic location since the hotels are across the street from each other. Please avoid the Park Central New York hotel at all costs.Worst experience in the Dom.Rep so far! We went to the Edehn from 26th March to 9th April.Our 4th trip to the Dominican, and the only bad experience... all the others were great!!I'm going to try to be short and to the point because I want to forget chair wars at dawn as soon as possible, and look forward to my next holiday which sure as hell won't be at the Edenh!Travelled with First Choice from England, and the whole trip was a complete cock up from start to finish. Won't bother including everything because others have already mentioned them.Felt like I needed another holiday after I got home.... nothing enjoyable about a holiday where you have to be up at 6.45am to get a parasol and sunbeds for a family of 4!! Sleeping in can't happen at the Edenh if you want shade for the day by the pool or on the beach!We paid a supplement for interconnecting rooms... we didnt get interconnecting rooms when we arrived.... we complained... we were told they didn't offer this option!Complained to our First Choice Rep... also expressed our concern about the sunbed situation... she reassured us chairs and parasols would arrive in the next day or so and she would get back to us about the room.The parasols didnt appear at all while we were there and most of the parasols that did exist were getting broken daily as they got blown over by the wind.Saw guests paying the chair maintenance men cash to actually get a parasol!Next evening we were told we had been allocated an interconnecting room.... packed up all our stuff, went to the room.... OH NO! A gaping hole in the ceiling and water dripping through onto the floor!Got taken to a second room... no air con working and the interconnecting doors jammed shut. We were all so tired we decided to take it anyway, at least we wouldnt get wet!Air con fixed pretty quickly at least :-) Doors were partially fixed.Speciality restaurants simply cannot cope with the volume of guests... people started queuing at 5pm to get seated. As this wasn't our idea of a pleasant holiday we didn't bother and chanced our luck coming by later, about 9pm, to see if there was any room. Although this meant we missed the theatre entertainmant every night, but we managed to get a table by 9.30pm most nights until the end of our holiday when the hotel was overbooked and it became hopeless.The buffet restaurant is ok, but a bit repetitive.By halfway through the holiday the chair wars situation was getting us down... the kids were spending afternoons in our room to stay out of the sun and my husband was tired from getting up at sunrise!We were green band guests and we had noticed that there was more room around the pink band pools (Paradise Club), they also seemed to have enough umbrellas and chairs and the 2 bars were quiet in comparison to the single green band bar by the pool.Bar service also seemed to be faster if you were a pink band guest... This is the first time we have seen this band segregation in an all-inclusive, and I must admit, I didnt much care for it! I dont see why you should be made to feel second class when you have paid good money for a holiday, and being a green band certainly made me feel that way once or twice.This was proved to us when towards the end of the holiday we got a phonecall from reception asking us if we would move rooms again.They informed us that the hotel was very overbooked for the following week and they didnt have enough rooms, they could fit 8 guests into our 2 interconnecting rooms. They offered us one of the rooms overlooking the sea at the front of the hotel which were for pink band guests. Reluctant to move rooms again we went to see the room, which turned out to be beautiful with a very large hot tub on the balcony and another jacuzzi in the bathroom... the downside was that there was only one bedroom and an adjoining lounge area with sliding doors between. My kids are teenagers and need full size beds to sleep in but we were assured they would give us comfortable beds for them in the lounge area.We agreed to move again on the condition they upgraded us to pink band guests, and provided some rum in the room for us as we were tired of having to walk up the the main bar by reception for a drink after the pool bar had closed at 6pm. We dont drink beer, and thats all they provided in the fridge along with coke and water which wasnt always replaced every day.Changing rooms turned out to be a good move and improved things for us a little bit.There was a definate difference to the way we were treated once we were upgraded to pink bands... we were always served promptly at the main bars, seemed to get seated in restaurants faster and were actually offered parasols before we had to ask. The pools areas were quieter and the bars much less busy. I must admit to feeling a little guilty for abandoning my fellow green banded guests as I watched them scrambling for beach chairs and parasols and packed in like sardines around the main pool.Unfortunately we still needed to get up quite early to get chairs and a parasol as the now fully booked hotel was bursting at the seams and there simply were not enough chairs by a long way.The final straw was on the day of departure when First Choice told us the wrong pick up time from reception. We waited in reception 3 hours but no bus arrived to collect us and we ended up having to make a mad dash for the airport by taxi, gripped with fear that we would miss our flight home and have to spend another few days at the Edenh.We really had enough of the place after 2 weeks.Must admit its the first time we have all wanted to go home by halfway through the holiday!!So, in a nutshell, the Edenh needs at least another 2 speciality restaurants, needs more chairs and parasols that dont get blown over and broken and they need to stop making green band guests feel second class.Last trip to the DR we stayed at The Riu Mambo and they could certainly teach the management at the Edenh a thing or two about how to run a great resort where guests leave feeling relaxed, happy and with warm memories :-)Good luck to all future guests at the Edenh Real.The slogan of this hotel is maximum vegas - I beg to differ. While this resort has excellent an location on the strip and some very nice hotel amenities (the pool) the rooms and staff are in need of upgrading - desperately. We selected the MGM this time for my 30th birthday and have been to Vegas 7 times previously, this was the 4th time to this resort and it is safe to say we will not be back. I realize that the MGM empire is large in Vegas; however, I would suggest that the mindset of this conglomerate switches from quantity to quality. ROOMS We were extremely disappointed with the room. The first issue that we had with the room was the lack of a fridge. That is totally ridiculous. What resort, especially one claiming to be 'maximum vegas' does not come with a fridge? Nothing like warm bottle of water or beer after walking the strip! I was equally unimpressed to find that the TV's in the room was an 18" Phillips tube televisions. The last time I saw a TV like that was in my Grandma's den, 10 years go! Today, you would be hard pressed to find that TV anywhere other than good will (and the MGM of course). The carpet in the room was absolutely disgusting, filled with I would say 20 years of Vegas funk. I thought the carpets were gross 8 years ago; but, they have yet to be changed (or cleaned for that matter). The HVAC system in our room was so loud it shook the metal casing off of wall in the middle of the night. Scared the crap out of us. It took three calls to MGM's "customer service" and over 12 hours before they were able to organize anyone to attend the room to fix it. The "customer service" at front desk would sooner transfer you to engineering rather than actually assist you with the problem - customer service must simply be a symbolic term for the team at MGM. The various service personnel along with multiple other staff members echoed my sentiments and further indicated that it is becoming embarrassing to work in this hotel as the mandate is to band-aid rather than fix and upgrade (no joke - multiple staff members said this). We also has the delight of black mold in the ceiling of the room. I do not understand how this could have gone unnoticed for that length of time - I would suggest it was notice and not fixed. The picture of the mold is attached for your viewing pleasure. I do have experience with mold in my own employment as a property manager and would hazard to guess that if the surface mold is that prevalent in what should be a dry location in the room, the inner cavity of the walls would be absolutely covered. The hotel staff were notified 3 separate times and they finally wished to urgently relocate us at 7 PM on our last night, 15 minutes prior to our dinner reservations - Brutal service, but typical of our experience with this resort on this trip!! I suggested the the mold may be building up due to the broken bathroom fan. We travelled with others on this trip who had the exact same experience with their rooms - right down to the noisy HVAC, antique appliances and broken bathroom fan. At least the MGM is consistent! We obviously did not spend much time in our room, you rarely do anywhere in Vegas; but, that does not mean that every component within the rooms and the rooms themselves need to be old, dangerous, and under maintained while you enjoy your "Maximum Vegas" experience. The best part - If we were to stay an extra night they were charging $347.00 per night for that room. SLEEP Very little sleep occurred. The amount of noise from other rooms, our HVAC, the hallway and outside was staggering. The sound proofing the MGM is nonexistent. SERVICE Most of my comments pertaining to service are apparent above; however, we had additional instances of horrible service that were not related to the room. The servers and bartenders at Zuri are the rudest group of wait staff that I have encountered - anywhere in the world. It was an unfortunate meeting place for our group due to the proximity to the elevators so we meet there once or twice a day and would usually sit to have one drink together before heading out. We thought it may have been a 1 off but it was again consistent. Rude, arrogant and belittling staff fill that bar - it was nausiating to deal with them. We also had the extreme displeasure of dealing with the most unpleasant host at the David Copperfield Show. This particular gentleman had managed to offend the entire row (almost 20 people) to the point where it took most of us 15 minutes of show time to recover from. He was unbelievable rude and further had no clue how the seats related to the tickets and then proceeded to blame the patrons. I would say that this job is simple. Smile and welcome people, set the mood and guide them to their seats - he failed miserably on all accounts. The show however was great and I do recommend it. POOL The pool was absolutely great. incredible facility, and in my opinion the best I have seen in Vegas. One funny instance though. We spent a portion of two days around the pool. The first day we were drinking beer and we were not carded once although we obviously had id with us. The next day we walked (a great distance) to the bar to order a bottle of water and were made to return to grab ID. The bartender was very aggressive (seems to be a trend at MGM) and indicated its the law; but, that begs the question as to why the resort staff at the MGM are allowed enforce the "law" at their discretion. I thought it was strange, no id needed for alcohol; but, greatly inconvenienced for a bottle of water. Based on the upkeep of their rooms I would guess the pool will eventually have the same fate. OVERALL We will not go back to any MGM property in the near future as their policy on experience has been made abundantly clear to us. The MGM needs to focus on the total package not getting people through the door for special events. They say Vegas is struggling in these hard economic times - I think I might know why! Good Luck in Vegas, it is still lots of fun!this is my review of quite frankly the most useless hotel I have ever encountered. please see my letter to them below and pics attached. read from the top down (incl the farcical response) part 1 Dear Sir/Madam I wish to complain about the treatment received and lack of quality with regard to my stay in the Central Park Hotel from the 11th August for 2 nights. Myself and my partner had arrived in London having been up from 3am british time flying from Palma. Having lugged our bags around we eventually got to the hotel around 3-4pm physically and mentally exhausted. We had requested a double room and arrived to find a small twin room which had any space possible taken up by our bags (which the concierge or anyone else didnt offer to help with). We immediately requested a change of room from 417 I believe and were then switched to 517 (I am not 100% certain of the numbers) which was again miniscule. It began to get even better, as we noticed a power box of some sort right directly behind the bed which I would imagine would surely be a safety hazard. There was also a loose skirting board and bits of carpet not laid properly with threads clearly visible and parts of it partially ripped. Having lifted the duvet it was clear the bed was also not clean judging by the amount of hair in it. I congratulate you for having the first bed I have ever seen in need of a shave! The pictures of the above are attached! We immediately rang reception who promised to get housekeeping to contact us, 15 minutes later having not heard a word we decided to go back to reception and complain. At this stage we were very tired, our bags had been lugged around all day to the point where it felt like an extra body part(s). We told reception we were extremely disappointed with this treatment as we were very tired from travelling and had hoped to rest and wash before meeting friends. We had now changed rooms twice which was a waste of time given the 3rd room was again miniscule (700 and something). Once again no discount/major apology was offered and once more we had to lug our bags again as the staff didnt offer to (concierge was watching sky at this point). This experience has made me extremely angry and frustrated and certainly put a huge downer on my trip to London, things didnt improve as the staff then just ignored us for the rest of the trip even when we made the effort to say hello. Manners dont cost much do they? This included the cleaning staff who didnt even acknowledge us and one member of staff seeing me come out of the lift and turning their back! I began reading some more reviews on my phone which were surprisingly good until I discovered that despite having a concierge there was no facilites to look after our bags until it was time for us to make our way to Gatwick on our check out day. This turned out to be true when we enquired. We again complained that it was the least that could be done given our issue with the rooms and the money we paid (€213 not the dearest price, but it is dear when you consider how much we had to save given our bills, only for I had already been charged through Otel.com I would have left the hotel minutes after arriving). Although I was told facilities are not provided to store bags, I fail to see the purpose of a concierge who from what I can see did absolutely nothing other than watch sky and couldnt even speak english! The reception staff in trying to explain muttered and mumbled a half hearted apology which just made me leave in utter frustration (to lug our bags around once more, to Victoria at a cost of £25). This most defintely the cherry on top of an awful experience which more or less ruined my trip to London. This merely describes my anger and utter frustration with the rooms and the service and staff from the hotel, I am utterly disgusted with the treatment received. I would most defintely not recommend this hotel to anyone! That said I would welcome your comments and a response to this, (an offer of a refund wouldnt go amiss) otherwise I would certainly have no problem in posting this or my views to deter any future visit for anyone across the world on the many websites I use to book hotels (and I am not talking just about tripadvisor or facebook). Given my experience of working in the Government for over a decade I would also certainly not hesitate to contact a local representative or Government Minister to highlight the issues I have raised. I await your response. Yours Sincerely PART 2 Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your email. First you have booked a room in the quiet zone which is in the basement and is a room without windows. But we have allocated a nice standard room which was not up to your expectations and as a courtesy we have moved you to an executive room on the 7thfloor for which the rate is 50% higher than the room you have booked. I refer you to our website which clearly shows that we don’t offer luggage storage facilities and concierge service. And I must attract your attention that we are a 3*** hotel, not a 4**** or a 5***** deluxe. On your next visit to Central Park Hotel please contact me personally and I will be there to welcome you and make sure you get a very nice, executive room at no extra cost. Kind Regards, ********************* Front Office Manager Central Park Hotel 49/67 Queensborough Terrace London W2 3SY PART 3 (which has not been responded to) dear xxxx, Thank you for your response. I am confused as how you came to the conclusion that I booked a room in the basement without windows? The rooms were on the 4th and 5th floors and did have windows. You then suggest that I was moved to the 7th floor into an executive room yet it didnt look at all different from either of the other 2 rooms I declined. Your explanation that "we are a 3*** hotel, not a 4**** or a 5***** deluxe. " is true but I can clearly see that from the site and it is almost as if you are saying that as an explanation for things being so poor. I didnt expect a 5 star hotel and a presidential suite but I certainly expect a lot better from a hotel I pay over 100 Euros a night for. The 2 star travelodge I stayed in near Gatwick airport had a room twice the size for £19, whilst its not exactly the centre of London, it was much better value. I also note that you say you dont provide a concierge service yet there is a picture of it on the main site, as they didnt look after the bags/or even offer any assistance to us, I am not sure what the purpose of it was. Whilst your site does not indeed advertise that it stores luggage I would have assumed that this was a basic service provided as it has been in probably every hotel I have ever stayed in. There is also no reference in your email to explain 1. The attitude of staff. 2. The safety hazard of the second room. 3. The appearance of the room with the carpet. 4. The bed being covered in hair! Again, I would welcome your response. signed xxxFiller food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.This place is average... at best.Excellence? I Don't Think So... As soon as we arrived at the resort for check in, we were told by the front desk that the van that brought us here took our hotel voucher. And that he had no access or information of who brought us to this resort. We asked him to access our names on the computer and he told us he could not do that. And made us call Liberty Travel in New York at a charge of $3.00 to us because of his incompetence. After we had Carl from Liberty Travel call him back and fax the hotel voucher three times, the gentleman still denied us our room with our king size bed request. And told us that it would be at least two hours for check in. Upon arriving in our room, the toilets were not cleaned - stains were left from previous guests! The comforter had cigarette burns and the Jacuzzi was stained. So we disregarded it the first day, hoping that the following day it would be cleaned. To our dismay the following day (at 9:00pm) our beds had not been made, nor was any of the room cleaned. Frustrated we spoke to someone at the front desk who barely spoke English like most of the staff and calmly told then that we would like our room cleaned by the time we returned from dinner at 10:00pm. And at 12:30am our room was still not cleaned. We called the front desk complaining and the only response was OK OK OK Because the person working the front desk clearly did not understand any English. He offered to have someone sent at 12:30am to clean our room and we refused and asked to speak to a manager and he then told us manager no aqui home. So once again nothing was resolved that night.The next morning we approached the front desk and spoke with the assistant manager, Jose Garcia, who assured us that the rooms would be cleaned promptly and not to worry. Unfortunately, when we returned to our room at 7:00pm from the pool our room keys were not working. The problem with the room keys continued for six days straight out of the ten days we were there. We walked to the lobby from room #14009 (which was quite a distance) to have them reactt working. We go back once again very upset and now the front desk tells us its the battery and that we should wait in front of our room until the repair man comes. He arrives an hour later just to tell us its the keys. After the repair man told us what the problem was, we AGAIN went back to the front desk, were we encountered Mr. Ramone De Jesus, the manager of the facilities and explained to him what the repair man said. We request to brand new keys and he said OK, and in front of my eyes he simply recoded the keys and told us that he fixed the problem and once again it was OK. Upon returning to the room the keys surprisingly did not work AGAIN! Needless to say we were ready to go home and it was only our second day there.Service at all the restaurants, at any time was terrible. We are both from New York and we have seen the best service and the worst service. Nothing compares to an hour and a half wait just for a coke at a five star hotel. Or the amount of time we waited to be seated in an empty restaurant because there was not enough help to clean the tables. When we were finally seated we expected the table to be clean but it was not and then had to wait another 45 minutes for utensils and a menu. The staff clearly does not understand English nor did a tip help the situation. After giving a $5.00 tip in hopes of better service, we never saw that waiter again. The food at the outdoor restaurants were infested with flies and we were greeted by mice two nights in a row in the Japanese / Italian Restaurant / Breakfast Buffet room. We alerted the waiter, who said he would take care of it and confirmed to us the next morning at breakfast that the mouse was taken care of, only to have it run by our feet again. How much more could we take from Secrets Excellence. A basic request like a coca cola was mistaken for rum. At this point we had to get up and actually serve ourselves. Especially in your French restaurant which was supposedly the best turned out to be the worst. We ate better food at the snack bar and had bera pillows. Two hours later nothing had arrived. We called the front desk again, asking for the pillows they told us our towels were on the way. So we explained again, what pillows were and two hours later we received three pillows with NO pillow cases. I guess that was our fault because we did not specify pillow cases with the pillows.The employees working for this resort are way over worked because we would see the same employees serving us breakfast in the morning, hosting and waiting on us at 2:00am at the disco.In conclusion, Secrets Excellence was far from excellent. It amazes us as to how this resort was rated as a five star according to Liberty Travel and a six golden star according to Apple Tours and the Dominican Republic. After finally speaking to Mr. Walters assistant did we actually feel like someone was listening and understood us. Marcia Arias, was the only person at the resort who was concerned about our ordeals and tried to better the situation. Secrets Excellence needs to staff more people like her, who can communicate with the guests and be more accommodating. This is one of the worst mismanaged hotels we have ever been to. The only thing this resort has to offer at this point is its beautiful grounds. The service and the food is way below average and unfortunately we were not the only guest who shared these feelings. Have your management visit the pool bar daily to hear all the complaints.Then they somehow made a dry and burnt crust, around a raw and cold inside.First time poster and this is a review I felt compelled to write while still staying at the hotel itself. It has been one of the worst hotel experiences of my life. First of all, I am generally pretty laid back about hotels, but enough has happened this week for me to sign up for a Trip Adviser account just to relay my experience. This is NOT, what-so-ever, by far, even in a fairy tale, a Five Star Hotel. If I didn't see it myself I doubt anyone would believe this experience as it seems like something you would only see in a comedy at the movies. Background: We are traveling as a large group with an 80 room block for business travel. I arrived a night early for a 8 night stay. Room: When I first arrived, I walked by the 5 Star rating outside the hotel. I thought I would be impressed. The room they gave me was a box with no windows and with the internet connection not working. Thinking the cable was unplugged from the wall, I went behind the desk and found an open box of condoms. They quickly upgraded me to the only side of the hotel that actually has nice rooms (the front) and apologized. Room was nice, but the cleanliness of the room left much to be desired. But at least the internet worked at blazing fast speeds of 56KB per second. Restaurants: Half of the restaurants are closed. They website lists six, but all are closed except Docklands, the Italian place, the Indian place, and the bar. They even list signs to these restaurants and their operating times in the lobby on an electronic display. Clearly this hotel has zero attention to detail if you cannot even delete the restaurants from your electronic screen placed at the front of the hotel. Internet and Business Center: They charge you $27 a day to use the internet at speeds slower than a 56KB modem. Completely and utter rip off. We tried to “rent” a projector but they said we could only buy one instead. In the hotel book it says "A/V equipment can be rented at our Business Center. Please contact our Business center to arrange your requirements." We called back and mentioned this and again they said they could only have us purchase a projector. Finally, we had to print pages for a business report, I asked where the nearest Kinkos/FedEx or printing location was. *blank stares from the staff* They finally printed it themselves and charged approximately $1 USD per page. Concierge: Complete Clown Show. First, When we first arrived they pointed us to a bar a 10 minute walk from the hotel that was full of prostitutes as "the place to go" that is close to the hotel. Second, I tried to get several tour bookings through them and even tried to set up a golf tee time. Each time the "concierge" handed the phone to me and I had to talk myself to make the bookings. I finally gave up. Others in our group had similar incompetent experiences with the concierge. It was joked that they might have trouble booking us a glass of water through their own room service. Security: First story: When locked out of my room, I had to get a new key. I went up to front desk and asked for a new key. They gave me one without asking for an ID. Second story: This is might be a five star hotel if you are a sex tourist perhaps. It seems the ladies just walk up to your room and come on in. To make matters even more comical, one of my business partners had two prostitutes ask for the key to their room at 3 AM because they had left something in the safe the night before. They walked in on the sleeping woman and woke her up to have them check the safe. She took a photo just to prove she was not making up the story. She later found out that the ladies handed out a room key without ID. To test the theory, two days later, she went up to the front desk and directly asked for the key to hey room from a new manager. The manager started to hand over the key without checking for ID, until she asked if they were forgetting something. Final story, While having beers late one night, the “night club” they had downstairs clearly had some very colorful individuals walk through the hotel. Location: Horrible. Construction is directly on the right side of the hotel. Most of the rooms have zero view if they have a window at all. The location, as we found out, is in a more seedy area of the city. To get to Atlantis or downtown the cab drivers knew where to go better than the cars and drivers that the hotel used. They looked nice and the cars were better than cabs, but each time I was in one of the cars, I questioned if the driver really knew where we were going. In one instance, he dropped us off ¼ mile away from the location we asked him to drop us off at. Straw that broke the camel’s back): Having come back from a business tour, I headed across the street to Burger King with a friend and we came back to the hotel. Sitting on one of the tables in the lobby not associated with any restaurant we were relaxing eating our food. The head manager walked up and asked us if we were guests and asked us to take our food to our rooms as outside food was not allowed in the lobby. I wouldn’t have said anything, but I felt that this hotel had too many problems for this to be a true concern and they did not have any signs posted. He proceeded to argue with me even though I had asked that they make an exception. Completely flabbergasted we both headed to our rooms after having been scolded like we were in high school by the manager. Is this truly how they treat their paying guests? Final verdict: Between complete lack of customer service, location, value, security, and general feeling the entire week, I would give this hotel one star. Why one star? They at least had working toilets. Do not come to this hotel.As someone who has stayed in many Las Vegas hotels on and off the Strip over the years, I was expecting a minimum standard for this off the beaten path hotel on Paradise Road which is quite far from the Strip. I booked there because I was attending an industry conference at the attached convention center and thought it would not be too bad. I was disappointed over and over again during my stay. I booked a KING BED SUPERIOR ROOM STRIPVIEW on the hotel website- the most expensive rate available and as a Hilton Platinum Member was excepting something decent but... First, check-in (7pm) Pb 1: No special line for Hilton Platinum Members, only one for VIPs which was not manned by anyone. Fine, I lined up with everyone else for the 2 receptionist on duty. 15 mins wait Pb 2: Showed my credit card and was asked to sign my name on the electronic screen. My rate and length of my stay were never confirmed. I was just given keys by the harried attendant who pointed out which elevator bank I should take ( a 5 mns walk) Pb 3: She gave me the wrong directions! After going up and finding it was the wrong tower, I came back down and went to the correct tower. Another 5 mns walk! Pb 4: Entering my room, I noted that a) it was not a king, b) it was not "strip" view. I called the front desk to change rooms and was asked to come back to the lobby since there was no one who could quicly come up to me with keys to a new room Pb 5: back down at the front desk, I was now suspicious and caught the receptionist trying to give me a room near the elevators even though my Hilton profile specifically indicate that this was not my preference Pb 6 finally entering the correct room -it is now past 8pm, more than one hour after I lined up to check in. The room was just ordinary, standard hotel furniture, a rather used look but no obvious hygiene problem. Strip view? Yeah, far far away you can glimpse the Winn hotel on the left and the Stratosphere on the right Stay: The whole hotel looks old and tired. Game area was sad with mostly an over 60s crowd playing the penny machines. Pool was closed for renovation, only option was to schelp over to the Hilton Grand Vacation on the strip (a 1/2h walk or take a cab) and show your card if you want to use the pool. I wonder if anyone ever did that? Since it was late that first day, I decided to have dinner in the Hotel Steakhouse (TJ's) with a colleague. Big mistake. Restaurant decor was abysmal, prices were expensive and service was very poor. The only reedeming thing was a pretty decent steak but I think it is hard to mess up a 22oz filet mignon. At $80 per person including a glass of wine, it was definitely not worth it. Other nights, I went on the strip but this hotel is so far from everything, there is NOTHING within 20 mns walk. Use the taxis if you can afford it or the monorail if you can't. I still remember the days when the monorail was free! Not anymore my friends. Room: Inconsistent evening turn-overs. One day it was done, another it was not. Don't care too much either way but if you do or don't do something be consistent! Usual dime and nickel in the room, $3 water bottles with Hilton Brand name so you can't drink it and replace it by a cheaper one from a supermarket. High speed internet at $12.99. Thank god for my laptop air card. Local phone calls at $1. Thank god for my cell. Fax number: not written on the room phone! Why? They don't want folks to receive faxes free! They want you to use the business center fax number where you will pay dearly! Still faxed myself my return flight boarding pass but had to pick it up downstairs and bluntly refuse to pay the $1 they wanted for the privilege. How cheap! ATM: don't withdraw cash there!!!! Apart from the usual $3 surchage, a colleague who tried to withdraw money was given instead a print out to take to the Casino cage because the machine had ran out of cash. There, he was asked to show his card and ID which were photocopied, sign some documents, appose his fingerprint (!) and wait for 10 mns before they reluctantly gave him his measly $100!!! UNBELIEVABLE! Convention Food: catered by Hilton: abysmal. Even though the organizers had payed for a packaged breakfast for the attendees, there was insufficient items. Bagels and hot water ran out after 10mns and were never replaced. A little reception around 6pm the first day had the worst appetizers I had tasted anywhere. I could go on and on but bottom line never again! If you can afford it, pay a bit more and go elsewhere or do your research and pay less and go elsewhere. Only come visit if you want to do the Star Trek experience or attend one of their shows which feature mostly have-beens anyway. I can't wait to give the same feedback when Hilton sends me a comment on your stay request as they always do!On July 25/10, we were in a Parlor Suite asleep in our room with the bedroom door closed. We had turned the lights out, and drew the shades closed in order to get black out conditions in our room. 8:30 a.m. someone turned the light switch on in our bedroom, causing my wife to stir. She yelled “what the hell”, expecting I was up and responsible for the lights, only to look over and see me sleeping beside her! Whoever they were saw both of us in bed, then proceeded to close the door and make their way out of our room with about $500.00 in cash. When we got up and went into the living room area, the thieve(s) were gone, but the adjoining room door was left open 2 feet. My wallet and wife’s Fendi glasses were moved up to the bar, and the cash was taken. They were obviously planning on coming into our bedroom and ensuite to clean up on any other jewelry and or monies. We phoned the front desk immediately and told them of our problem. They said they would send security right away. 10 minutes later I called the front desk again to say no one came. 10 more minutes passed by so I called them again. Then another 10 more minutes went by before I called them again. After 35 minutes, security finally showed up and said in a very uncaring and condescending tone “What’s Your Problem?” The security person named Bob was callous. My wife thought it must have been an inside job because of his delay in attending and indifferent demeanor with us. I told him don’t be so grumpy with us, at which point he settled down to have me start writing down the report. His excuse was that he was busy with other problems. So then what were the six security guards doing at the bottom of the elevator, in and around the private tower suites entrance? Sweet Nothing!! Lamar Odom, Kevin Durant, and other Team USA Basketball players were staying in these suites as well at the same time. Maybe some, all, or most of the suites were targeted. It’s apparent that the Wynn stood down while doing nothing about adding additional security. In the end, the Wynn Risk Management Department said it was our fault for leaving our front door ajar. The door handle lifts up to deadbolt, and opens again by pushing down. I know I didn’t lift the handle up to deadbolt it, but I’m sure it didn’t stay open on its own either. These doors usually slam by themselves. The door does not need to be dead bolted to be closed. If normally closed (but not dead bolted) you still need a key card to get in. When asked about security cameras in the hallways, they said they don’t have them and never would because of guest privacy. REALLY! What guest needs privacy in the hallway? This is a public corridor that needs to be monitored against all types of crime. Safe to say, this place has no security and I can never return again given this fact. The bottom line is, was it possible that we didn’t close the door properly, and some random door pusher entered our room, proceeded to rob us, then opened the adjoining room door, before finally leaving through the front door? Sure it’s possible, but if he ran out the front door, wouldn’t it be left ajar as well, as Risk Management told me I had done at 2:16 in the morning!......and……. If my door WAS ajar, security HAS the capability to see it and act on it. Security could then make one of two calls. Either call us to close our door, or call the thief to do his job! I have a relative that does security for one of the other 5 star hotels on the strip, and he said that his “Property Loss Reports” were constantly changed by his superiors to reflect a better (not responsible) management position. He laughed at us for expecting security, and also told us if we’re going to get our room broken into, it would be at a Hotel like the Wynn, and in one of the expensive suites, as that is where the money is. I would have written this review earlier, but I had to wait until now because I can’t post on the Wynn twice within a 3 month period. You see, we were here in April, and then again in July, so don’t expect your repeat visits to provide you with a better experience. And Lastly…. To Mr. Wynn…. Please take another look at the integrity of your security personnel, and or maids / minibar refillers. I believe the possibility exists that our deadbolt was intentionally left open on our adjoining room by someone who can rightfully gain entrance to our suite. I also believe it is possible that access was provided into our room through that unlocked adjoining room door. And I also believe that it is possible that security and/or the maids know of this and can take advantage of it. Bear in mind that this all conveniently took place on our last morning, allowing us very little time to react to this disturbing violation of privacy prior to our flight home.Worst vacation ever We got there on Sunday Nov 18th. We were very anxious to get there as our flight was arriving early in the day...we thought we would start enjoying our vacation early!!! Boy were we wrong! I will make my review short and sweet (compared to the four-page complaint letter I sent to Barcelo 2 weeks ago that hasn't been addressed yet!!!).-Our rooms weren't ready for our arrival, we were asked to go eat and come back 2 hours later, there was only one rep at the front desk. (we were a busload of people arriving at once!)-When we got back, the rooms were still not ready, they started calling us by name as our rooms were made available.-To get to our rooms, we had to hop into the golf cart used to carry the luggage. The bellboys piled up the luggage behind us in such a way that they fell on us, and instead of apologizingm the simply continued their work as if nothing happened.-Got to our rooms, the TV picture on ALL channels was snowy and we were in a room with 2 double beds instead of one king size as requested. Tried calling for room change, we were told to contact Guest Services, who never answered the phone. Had to walk back to the front desk.-The rep at Guest Services promised me we would change rooms the next day and that he put in the request in the system.-Finally went to join my wife and sister-in-law at the pool for the few minutes I got to see the pool that day. Going back to our rooms, the keys weren't working anymore. Had to go back to the front desk.-When I got there, I was told I must've demagnetized my card!!! Yeah right!!! I hide my cellphone in my swimming suit so I can talk on the phone in the pool!!! And managed to demagnetize it in a matter of 4 hours...-The gave us new keys, and when we were on our way back to the rooms, a guest ran after me saying they want to speak to me at the front desk, went back...The guy asked me if my room number was XXX, I said yes, he then called me by a name, I said that wasn't me...hat's when the other guest said it was him...I guess I know why my key didn't work anymore!!!-The next day, we had our meeting with our tour operator's rep. I explained to her my issues and she went to speak with the reception supervisor, then ended up talking to the Director responsible for the rooms, who told her to have us come back at 3pm to get the keys to our new roomS (the upper case S is intentional) and tried to buy us with a 20 min massage.-Went back at 3 as required, and the guy at the front desk told me that we will only be getting 1 room (hence the issue with the capital S) and that they are doing me a favour because normally we have to pay extra to get one king size bed!!!-I obviously asked to speak to someone else, he made me go see his supervisor who tried to find a solution by explaining to me that they never got the request for 1 bed from the travel agency even though I explained to him that who's fault it was had become irrelevent by then. Anyways, we finally decided to stay in our rooms as they couldn't accomodate us, but on the condition that they fix the things that were wrong (TV and toilet that wouldn't flush everytime).-Neither happened, TV was still snowy (even though we saw other rooms with cristal clear image) and the toilet was not fixed.-By wednesday evening, when we went back to our rooms in the late afternoon, the pipe leading to the toilet in my sister-in-law's room was pierced and the bathroom was flooded. We called front desk at 5:30pm, and again at 6pm, and twice more at half hour intervals. We got fed up and went for dinner and figured we'd talk to them there since the restaurant is next to the reception.-At close to 10pm, they finally tell me the maintenance person is in the room and it's fixed. I get back to the room to verify (by then I didn't trust a word they said) and it was true, he did fix it. Up to then, he was the nicest person in the hotel. I asked him at what time did they tell him about the problem and he said it must've been around 9-9:30 and it was a maid who told him, not even the front desk that I called 4 hours eralier!-Thursday I couldn't take it anymore and wanted to speak to Barcelo head office. I will skip the front desk episode about getting the phone number, but in essence I was given the number of another Barcelo in DR instead of the head office. It seems this had some kind of impact because later that day they offered to change us to 2 suites. Obviously forget about the bellboys being there to move our luggage, after 4 calls and half an hour of waiting we went ourselves.-Then the part I like the most is the checkout. We had made a phone call to Canada, for which we were told by the tour operator's rep it costs 1.50$/min. At checkout, the guy (who had told me about paying extra for king size bed...I already didn't enjoy dealing with him), asked me if I made a call because he sees a charge but doesn't know what it represents. I answered yes, and it seems for a 5 min call, we were charged 21$...he told us it costs 4$/min not 1.50$. I aksed him for the details of the charge as I wasn't going to pay without it, he seemingly got offended by it and said: what, you think I am going to cheat you?!...I let it pass...Then the tour operator's rep arrived to the front desk, I asked her again and she confirmed she had read it in their pamphlet 1.50$, they spoke for a few min, then he waved at the guest behind me (completely ignoring my presence) to proceed with his request. That's when I raised my voice for the first time during the trip and asked to speak to someone else.The story about the charge ended with me not paying ebcause they couldn't produce a detailled bill.So far, everything I said was negative (to say the least!), however there were a few good things about the hotel: Angelo the maintenance guy, a few waiters (not all of them and not most of them) and the entertainment was amazing!Hope this helps you decide whether you want to spend your money in that hotel (or hotel chain)...good luck!Imagine traveling from the US on a 15 hour flight and being told you had to wait 4 hours to check in! While you sit and wait you watch people off the street check in. If you want to feel like a 2nd class citizen then this is the hotel for you! We have never in our lives been treated like this at any hotel. Granted this is a best western so its not a real 4 star hotel by American standards but the service even for a best western from the check in staff was a nightmare and was the worse part of our two week vacation. We booked this hotel as a package with our cruise line. We had two options this more expensive hotel and a lower star cheaper hotel. Of course after paying 12k already for this trip, flight, cruise, and tours we wanted this more expensive hotel for our special vacation. What a joke! The service and treatment you get for this hotel is not worth it. It was so bad we tried to change our 2nd stay at this hotel with our cruise line but couldn't as it was to late. Yes we had to indure the rude check in staff twice! Had to sit in the lobby and watch people check in before us twice! We stayed April 17th and April 29th. My husband asked the first time we checked in why others where being checked in and not us (and the other tourists mostly American from the cruise line) while Italians came in and checked in no issues. This rude RUDE lady named Paola at the front desk told my husband that it was the contract with the cruise line. NO check in till 2PM. First off no one sees this contract till you get to the hotel. They give you the contract then from a rep from the cruise line in the lobby. When he argued with the desk lady Paola saying how he saw others checking in she responded with they had more expensive rooms! Surely this woman was joking as all the rooms are either singles, double, or triple. We had a double (two twins pushed together to make one double size bed) with breakfast and a photographic view room being the 2nd most expensive per night room they have! Not everyone checking in before us Americans where triple bed rooms! My husband called her out and told her she was lying to his face as rooms where obviously open but we where forced to wait after our 15 hour flight. She didn't care no room for us.She didn't care we knew she was lying. She didn't care that rooms where actually open. Finaly as we threatened the cruise line rep stating that we wanted to leave and find a better hotel the cruise rep called her boss to call the hotel and talk to the rude hotel staff. So at 1230 over two hours of waiting we got a room. I don't know of anyone that has ever gone to a hotel and had to endure crazy strict check in times if rooms are open! No hotel does that! I have worked at a hotel before and if a room is open or dirty you call to get it cleaned and get people checked in. Especialy tourists. Well not this place! And dont expect to check out with the other guests at the hotel at 12 PM. If you go with a cruiseline check out is at 10AM! This is per Paola who works the check in desk in the mornings. She doesnt check if you ask to check out like the other people at 12 but just says NO. She must have special powers that allow her to know those things without looking at the computer to see. Just knows how to be rude and say NO and argue with guests. We waited till she left and talked to the nicer men working at night. The night manager looked stunned that we where asking to check out at 12. He kept saying this is normal check out you don't need anything special to check out with everyone else. They let us check out with everyone else at 12. All the information in the hotel, in your room, everything says check out is at 12. Paola of course was sticking to a contract that didnt even match our paperwork from the cruise that had it at even a different time. In her world we where tourist 2nd class citizens that needed to be out of her hotel at 10AM. Wouldnt it make sense to treat everyone the same? EQUAL! Not this place. They seem to have it backwards and treat the tourists like dogs. I have never in my life been treated this way at a hotel with such rudeness from the check in staff. We figured the room cost us atleast 300 if not more with breakfast a night in US Dollars. And this is the sevice we got both times at check in for our money. We spoke to the other cruise group on the bus to the ship about the cheaper hotel they stayed at and no one at the cheaper hotel was treated like that or forced to wait hours to get a room. So basicly I paid more to be treated worse at this hotel. Breakfast if your from the US is not what you would think. Its GROSS. The bacon is like some soggy strange bacon that was not eatable. The eggs not good and the Orange Juice and Milk where bad. We ate the pastrys. Only thing you would want to eat after tasting the other stuff. That was it for breakfast as that was the only non cheaply made bad tasting food. This hotel is located in an area close to everything. You can grab a taxi at Termini station right across the street and take a 12 euro ride to the tourist spots you want to see. That was the only plus at this place. Typical small european rooms. Walls in rooms have scuff marks on them all over. Oh and if you go when its colder like we did no heat! They turn the heat off for spring at this hotel so expect cold mornings. You can turn the AC on in your room but can't make it warmer at night or in the morning. Not a 4 star hotel by American standards. I did leave a comment card and did tell the night manager of the check in rudeness with the staff and issues. So this hotel was left writen comments from us about this. I would suggest from how I saw Americans treated that best for US travelers to stay at a real four or five star by US standard hotels. You might pay more but you wont be left in the lobby waiting all day to get a room, rushed out like your scum in the morning per the attitude of the check in staff, and wont be treated over all like 2nd class. We wont be staying here next spring when we go back. You don't need us Americans at your hotel then you don't need our money! If we are such a bother to you when we go to ask questions at the front desk or check in then don't worry we wont be seeing you next spring!I have been a Marriott Gold member for ages as I travel frequently for business and have stayed at Marriotts all over the world. This past weekend my significant other and I decided to go to Paris for the weekend for a "just us" weekend before Christmas. I had stayed at this hotel before and found the location to be excellent and thought it a great way to use some of my Marriott points. A few things to note really: The location is excellent. The heating/air con is from 1970 and without a thermostat. It's a strange dial and button combo that's a bit of a guessing game. We never could get our room cool enough to sleep. I cannot speak to all other rooms but the wifi signal in 121 was so low it was unusable. A few other guests mentioned the same issue so it's worth your while to check the signal in the room before unpacking if you need internet access. The Concierge is awful. As noted on here by other reviewers the concierge service was unreliable. For a 5 star hotel this is simply unacceptable. Upon arriving on Friday night we requested the concierge book us a restaurant for Saturday night. He listed a few options from which we chose Le Duc a seafood restaurant and a time of 8:30pm. We also asked that he book us a taxi for 8pm to get to the restaurant. He told us he would call us to confirm the reservation and the taxi was no problem. By Saturday midday we still hadn't heard from him but were not concerned as we figured if he couldn't get us into Le Duc then surely wherever he did book would be just fine. Upon returning to the hotel we discovered that we had no reservation for dinner nor did we have a taxi booked. Shenanigans ensued and we did eventually get in but this was not the relaxing romantic experience we hoped for. Nor once did he apologize. If you go book your own tables and transport or risk it. By Sunday night it was clear that most of Europe was having travel delays so before we departed we checked with the concierge on the status of the Eurostar trains. True to form he gave us erroneous info and told us all trains were running on time. Now if the internet had worked in the room we would have known this was not at all true and plastered all over every travel site known to man. So after one very unnecessary trip to the train station we came back to the hotel and checked in for another night. There are worse things than being stuck in Paris or so we thought. That night we chose to eat in the hotel restaurant. One very big mistake. It certainly wasn't cheap being a 200 pound meal. The things we ate in common were the beef carpaccio and the escargot. We had different mains. By 4am were almost simultaneously and violently ill. It became fairly clear that we had food poisoning of some sort. Now these things do happen in the nicest of places. It only takes one food handling mistake for someone to become ill and to be honest at that point I was pretty willing to consider it bad luck but did feel the need to tell the general manager so they could at least examine any remaining beef carpaccio and escargot and one would imagine not serve it to other guests. I called in the morning and asked to speak to the general manager and was told he would call back. More than 4 hours later and still no one had returned my call. I called again expressing just how ill we had become and that I felt this was a safety issue for other guests that should at least be known about. 2 hours later I got a call a man who was the head of guest relations, not the general manager. His name was Fabian or Fabio. When I told him how ill we had become he told me that there was no way the food we ate could have caused it because they buy there food from quality vendors and the kitchen has been inspected. So clearly Fabian has not the most basic knowledge about food safety or food poisoning or he would know all it takes is someone using an unclean spoon to cause it. But really it was his next statement that outraged me. I was most likely ill he said because I am an American and I'm not used to fine French cuisine. Nothing like adding insult to injury. And this American happens to live in Europe and my significant other spent his entire childhood in France but thanks for the theory! He also told me he had had excellent reviews of the beef carpaccio. So nothing was done. For all I know the chef was never even told. We were too ill to even stand up long enough to take a shower so we were stuck at the hotel for another night. The pain and stomach cramps were getting to a point where we really did consider going to the hospital as it was clear we were going to need medication of some kind. In the meantime we ordered a bottle of water from room service and the room service waitress upon seeing our condition was appalled and asked if we would like for doctor to be called to the hotel. Bless this woman. It would have been fantastic if say Fabien had mentioned this option! 250 pounds later we had a doctor who confirmed yes this was food poisoning and a round of antibiotics among other things. In grand total our delay due to illness cost us nearly 1000 pounds for the extra night plus the doctor plus medication etc. The hotel never once called to check on us never once offered so much as a bottle of water. In fact when we asked for clean robes they were never brought up. The food poisoning has been so severe that now two days before Christmas we are still eating no more than crackers and water. Our relaxing weekend before Christmas is now threatening to ruin not only the weekend before but Christmas itself. The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. I have never given a 1 star review but blatant disregard for safety is inexcusable. Thankfully we are not old nor traveling with small children or this could have had a very different outcome. I'm sure in truth one big hotel chain to the next doesn't vary greatly but I have always been loyal to Marriott feeling it was a sure bet when away from home. Not any more. Buyer Beware! There are many wonderful hotel choices in Paris and right on the CE. There is no reason to give this one your patronage.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.We have been to the Riviera Maya seven times and we have stayed in five different resorts. We would gladly return to the previous four, but NEVER to Ocean Maya. There are far better hotels for the same, or slightly more money. We received NONE of our promised (in writing) amenities such as liquor in the mini-bar, ice in the room, bottle of Tequila, and lobster dinner to name a few. ROOMS - Feel like Motel 6. Small, one sink in the bathroom. Mis-matched furnishings. The night tables were wooden cubes that were spray painted shiny blue. There is no full length mirror in the place and I had to stand on a chair to use the make-up mirror in the bathroom. You need to be at least 5'6'' to even have a peek. The beds have no box springs - that is why they are so hard, as others have stated. They are mattresses placed on a plywood box. Yes, the sheets feel like sand paper. They would have been made into drop cloths at my house. Renovation = flat screen TV and new paint. However, our cleaning person did a fabulous job keeping the room spotless. We left her a tip every day and received plenty of towels. FRONT DESK - Forget it. It took us over two hours at check-in to receive the type of room that we had confirmation for. Confirmation from the H-10 management and Continental Vacations. Our "personal" concierge was useless. Our thermostat for the A/C had to be re-programmed two days into our stay. We called/visited the front desk four times. The nighttime room temperature was 86 degrees. The next day it was fixed by dumb luck when we ran into our waiter from the night before who asked why we were so upset as we walked back from the front desk. He promised to send a maintenance man ASAP. Less than fifteen minutes later, a nice man showed up and it took him less than five minutes to fix the problem. People at the front desk smile and nod - that's it. GROUNDS - Beautiful and well maintained. The waterfalls and flowers are exceptional. The grounds keepers are always busy, there is no trash, no empty glasses; the resort is wonderful to view. However, that beauty does not save the experience. POOLS - Beautiful as well. The entertainment staff also does a great job at making everyone a part of the fun and the activities were well received by all. BEVERAGES - We were forced to upgrade to "Privledge." As another reviewer stated, if you want to drink any alcohol that you have ever heard of, you need to upgrade. Mexican liquor was used in all of the many varieties of sweet, fruity drinks that people ordered. There is Corona on tap, if you only drink beer. We are middle-aged grown-ups and we avoid most blender made concoctions. The top-shelf stuff is right there for all to see, but unless you upgrade, it will not be yours. You need that precious black bracelet. Even Absolut Vodka is considered top-shelf. There are signs saying "Privledge" on anything that is worth drinking. Yes, we did try small bribes before we made the decision to upgrade - to no avail. FOOD - There were some above average dishes, but these were few and far between. What is listed on the menu in the Italian Restaurant as filet of beef, is actually chuck steak. Chuck was the best cut of beef served anywhere. I don't even want to know what the hamburgers were made out of. As others have said, the buffet was the same thing every day. It was difficult to even make a salad at lunch. The best choice was a grilled chicken breast with Fast Fries. Much of the food is unrecognizable. However, if you want to fill up on desserts and bread, it could work out for you. Yes, there was a lot of "slop" at the buffets. BEACH & OCEAN - We got to lay on the padded chaise lounges overlooking the Caribbean because we upgraded to Privledge. We also had waitress service that was fabulous, though we only asked for bottles of water and ice. We had our own personal ice bucket that was replenished throughout the day and snacks. It was unfair to us that all guests are not afforded this luxury. The sand is white and powdery. Some of the beaches in Playa have coarse, brown sand. There was some seaweed wash-up, but the workers did their best to rake it up. The water was cloudy throughout our stay, which is unusual for the Caribbean. We walked about two miles in each direction, and this was one of the nicest beaches. It was not small when other resorts are considered. However, whether it be oil or mangrove deposits, the water was stagnant and BLACK just 1/4 mile away from the resort. Perhaps that is why the water is cloudy - UGH. RESTAURANTS AND RESERVATIONS - We sat in the air-conditioned sections of the restaurants. The dining room was sweltering for others - even at breakfast. This is appalling, as there were some older guests who did not upgrade. We walked out of the the Mexican Restaurant. Never have we seen such poor quality Mexican food in Mexico. They actually took nacho cheese sauce and mixed it with macaroni (just picture that) and called it Macaroni and Cheese. Even Kraft out of a box looks better. The table cooking at the Oriental Restaurant was a wonderful show, but the shrimp looked and tasted like the mini shrimp out of a can. The chicken and beef were better, but everything was very salty. Minestrone soup in the Italian was wonderful, but thank God we were sitting in the air-conditioned section. We watched others fan themselves as they ate. We were allowed to make dinner reservations; every restaurant is not open every day, though. Other guests waited in line. SHADY DEALINGS - OK we upgraded to save our vacation. We were quoted two different prices to upgrade $40 or $50 per day per couple. However, we went on a time share presentation (first ever) and got the cost reduced to $105 each for eight days. The time share is not really the type of time share that we are familiar with, but a points program to use at various places. The price went from $40,000 to $7,000 as time went by. Let the Buyer Beware.We called the Hotel regarding the type of room that we wanted (we specified a king size bed, which was also the selected bed on Orbitz upon booking). We arrived and the front desk confirmed a king sized bed upon check-in. We come up after spending 10 hours on a red eye flight to find two queen sized beds. (there is a big difference between a king and queen sized bed, but at that point we were too exhausted to care) Later to my surprise, the room and shower was a disabled access and ADA compliant. There were no shower doors to stop the flow of water to the bathroom. It was obvious that the Conrad Condado did not know what they were doing by giving us two queens instead of the king that they CONFIRMED TWICE (three times if you count the Orbitz booking) and giving us a disabled accessible/ADA room that we never requested. This room was was not acceptable since I was constantly slipping on the wet tiles when I got out of the bathroom. I called the front desk to complain and asked change rooms. The person at the front desk said that all rooms in the hotel were like that (which was a lie because eventually we were transferred to a room with a shower door). Later that evening I went down stairs to the front desk and complained about the obvious safety hazard. The front desk person/employee said she could not do anything about it because: (1) I PAID THROUGH ORBITZ AND THUS I GOT THE CHEAPEST ROOM--which would be the Disable Accessible room (complaint with the ADA, but a hazard for an able bodied person); (2) second she claimed that the hotel was booked. With no manager during that evening shift, I decided to return the next day. I came back the next day to speak to a manager. I threatened that the condition in our current room (with no shower doors) was ripe for a lawsuit and they were on notice three times. Eventually, she did change the room to a regular room with shower doors, but it still had two queen sized beds. At this point, not getting injured and not ruining my vacation were higher priorities than getting a room with the same view and same size room and bed. My issues with the Conrad did not stop with the room problems, upon check out (after staying 6 nights)I was again faced with rude service and inattentive employees. I arrive at the front desk a 7:15 am to catch a flight to the US. The only front desk employee was trying to solve a complex transaction with another customer. Rather than attempt to get another employee to help her out or see if my transaction could be solved in a few key strokes (which it could have been since I was only checking out), the employee continued with the transaction; and at one point chatted for 5 minutes with the bell hop in front of me and the previous customer. At that point I asked if there was another employee or a machine that could do a quick check out. What I got a a curt "NO, she was the only one there", with no empathy that their guest was trying to catch a morning flight. The rooms do not make up the horrible service that a guest will receive at the Conrad. The rooms are not spectacular. The rooms are old and there are spots in the bathrooms ceiling where the maintenance staff have painted over spots of mold. I addition the bathrooms are small. I am 5'10" 175lbs. and I can hardly fit in the bathroom. The pool and beach area are not that great. The speck of land that they call a beach is OPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND CONSISTS OF A LAGOON NEAR THE AVENIDA ASHFORD BRIDGE. This a major security concern and it does not look all that inviting. Also the pool is open and is accessible from Avenida Ashford; one could just waltz in. Although, there is security, the fact that the pool is open to the street causes concern. Next to the hotel is a GUTTED-OUT hotel filled with graffiti, and an couple of apartments in the same condition as the said hotel. These structures give the Conrad a nice depressed look, but to be fair Avenida Ashford is prime real estate in the city. As a warning to other travelers and people wisely allocating their limited budgets on travel, AVOID THE CONRAD AT ALL COSTS! The hotel is not worth your hard earned money. The service is horrible and the staff needs to be trained in the finer points of customer service, especially for this hotel brand. In addition, regardless of where and what site I book my hotel, I should not be treated as a second class citizen. This is uncalled for and should not be tolerated by the management at the Conrad. This is the worst stay I had at a Hilton brand hotel. I travel 1-2 months a year for pleasure and business, and 70% of the time I stay at a Hilton brand hotel. I can assure you this is by far the worst treatment I ever received. I guess you get what you paid for... at the Conrad Condado, you also get ripped off.This was hands down the worst hotel experience of my entire life! We have had better service and amenities at LaQuinta's! We arrived at the W at 4pm (an hour later than check-in), and we were told our room was not ready. The clerk gave us our room number so we could charge our beverages to the room and invited us to wait up at the pool deck for it to be cleaned. She took down my husbandsâ€™ cell phone number and promised to call when the room was available. On our way upstairs to the pool we decided to stop by the room to see if anyone was tending to it. We found ONE chambermaid working the entire floor, and at no hurried pace either. We could see our wait was going to be significant. Upon arriving at the pool deck we sought out the â€œchanging roomsâ€� mentioned to us by the clerk for putting on our swimming gear. We were appalled to find this so-called changing room was a Uni-sex, single stall restroom meant to be shared by all 100+ patrons of the pool area. Needless to say, it was absolutely disgusting! At the pool we started to get a clear picture of the typical character attracted to the W Hotel; frat daddies and sorority chicks. There wasnâ€™t a single place to find a seat anywhere on the deck. The pool area had a cool layout, but unfortunately my husband and I never got to experience it first hand b/c of the hoards of people we were contending with for space. PS- they charged us $5 for and 8 oz. cup of beer and $11 for a 8 oz. margarita. We waited at the pool for 2 hours and never received a call, so we finally headed back to the lobby on our own. We asked the clerk at the front desk, now a different young lady than before, if our room was ready yet, she looked up our name and told us it was. WE HAD NEVER RECEIVED THE PROMISED CALL! When we told her that her response was, â€œWell, I donâ€™t know why. We sent you a text message and I donâ€™t know why YOU didnâ€™t get it.â€� There was never any admission from her that a 2-hour wait, with no communication, was unacceptable! There was never even an apology! In her tone she even had the audacity to suggest it was our own fault the message hadnâ€™t been received. Incidentally, what kind of costumer service rep thought a â€œtext messageâ€� would be the best way to communicate with the customer? How impersonal! Then, on top of this, the girl proceeds to give us information for a completely different room number than what we received earlier. Waves of distrust for the Wâ€™s reservation software, containing our precious credit card information, came flooding to our minds. Whose room had we charged our drinks to and how easy would it be for someone else to do the same thing to us? Why had we even received an incorrect room number? Did we truly receive an incorrect room number, or did the clerk pull the olâ€™ switch-eroo because sadly the original room was still not available? All we do know for sure is that our first room was located at the very end of the hallway, where we could have enjoyed more privacy, and our new room was right, smack in the middle of the hallway where we had the luxury of hearing anything, and EVERYTHING that took place anywhere on our floor. The rooms at the W Hotel are a joke. You walk in and you are immediately in the bathroom. It feels like the dorms on a college campus. The hotel strives for a modern feel, but they used such cheap materials it ultimately feels contrived and desperate. It is evident that multiple corners were cut in the construction of this hotel. There is one outlet in the bathroom found tucked a foot from the floor in the narrow space between the sink and the shower. There is only one towel hook in the entire room. The closet space was obviously an afterthought; their own luggage holder couldnâ€™t even open the full span in the space within the closet. The lights in our particular room (#1421) were erroneously wired making it a guessing game each time you tried to turn off/on a light; sometimes one switch would work, but then it wouldnâ€™t so youâ€™d have to try another switch. The view was not at all â€œSpectacularâ€�; we faced a giant construction site. The walls were paper thin and our particular room had a conjoining door to another room which you could hear everything through. It was like having a roommate! Yeahï�Œ Because of the â€œqualityâ€� customer W Hotel apparently attracts, it was no surprise to us that at 2:15am we were rudely awaken by screaming drunk people streaming in from the bars. When sharing experiences with some fellow patrons the next morning we even learned about a couple of physical fights that took place in the hallway of the 8th floor between two different parties staying there. The valet service was literally the single enjoyable thing about this hotel. The guys truly had a heart for serving and seemed to enjoy their jobs. The wait was non-existent. They were very efficient. I guess the one thing W Hotelâ€™s management has done right is contracting out their valet parking. I hate to think we wasted $280 on such a pitiful experience. I read that W Hotelâ€™s in other cities have a much better reputation, but at this point I have such a terrible taste in my mouth because of W Hotel-Dallas, I doubt weâ€™d ever consider staying at another W anywhere. Corporate needs to conduct a major overhaul of management at this W or else this hotel is destined to fail.I recently stayed @ the Holiday Inn Wall Street with my Fiance right after staying at the Chelsea Indigo and the Staybridge suites. At both those other hotels i received decent service but kept mentioning to my Fiance that Holiday Inn would be way better. I am a platinum priority club member & I travel alot for work at always stay at Holiday Inn Express and Holiday Inn they always treat me very kindly and go out of their way to make me happy. This is NOT the case in this hotel. On cleanliness, price, and location alone the hotel would receive a 3 the hotel is clean but going through construction which instantly dirties your suitcases, the price is great and by using points they are one of the cheapest hotels in Manhattan, and the location is not very great unless your day revolves around wall street and the Brooklyn bridge. Now for the service it was terrible I am a platinum card holder (the highest level) for the hotel and I dont believe i should be waited on hand and foot but I do believe I deserve to be treated respectfully. Let me start by saying there is i ONLY 1 great employee there and that is the woman in the complimentary breakfast section she is very kind and friendly. Everyone else could not make the time to be bothered. When i arrived for check in the girl behind the desk waited a couple seconds to attend to me since she was on her facebook then I was given a decent room. I wouldn't bother asking for upgrades or paying for the most expensive room all the rooms are pretty much the same with an uninspired view. The room is very small and the bathroom is even smaller I would not recommend this hotel to families but only solo travelers or couples on a budget. Since I am a platinum member I received a free "gift" bag that was made up of a bunch of flyers from local businesses, 2 waters, and a bag of cookies. Don't break the bank! Versus at staybridge i received gourmet chocolates, a bottle of wine, and a handwritten thank you card. At hotel indigo i received a credit for my room mini bar and a room upgrade. My first of many problems occurred when I did not receive information about how to log onto the internet I called down and the phone rang for awhile so I hang up called back a little later. Then second time I called back Carlos picked up promptly and gave me the information on the internet code. After seeing a mistake on my bill while looking online ($110 dollars for using my free night for "incidentals" even though with no mini bar or room service I don't know how this would be achieved) I called down spoke to Carlos where I was told he could not help I would have to wait for the manager in the morning. In our conversation I was told too calm down and let him speak even though I hadn't even explained the situation and was only talking for 5 seconds. I think he just didn't want to deal with me. In the morning I went over to the front desk to speak to the manager who was in the "back" I said I would wait. The person at the front desk continuously asked me whats wrong so that she could tell the manager I kept saying I would wait but finally told her the situation and she went to the "back" to speak to the manager. Seconds later she came back and said "Ok I'll take care of it" no I'm sorry, no were sorry for the inconvenience of charging you $110 on your vacation, nothing! Not even a visit from the manager. Finally, I went back to the room and then down to the business center at around 10AM. I first turned on the computer and had wait for it to start up, then it asked for a password to log in to the desktop that only the employees had. Luckily there was a phone in the center so i called over the front desk and they said they would send someone over. I waited 10 minutes and no one showed on my way up I saw a maintenance person who helped me turn on another computer than didn't need a log in. I began using the computer and another person came into to use the computer I told them it didn't work and that they would have to speak to someone. They too called the front desk and no one came. As i finished up I passed by the front desk to see that the person waiting for the computer was trying to explain the situation to the front desk person who not only didn't understand the situation but offered to change rooms, hilarious! Finally, I checked out, left the luggage with the front desk who leaves there bags at the front desk hours before actually putting it anywhere. I went around the city and at about 1pm I called over to the hotel and said I need a cab to take me and my family to Newark airport they said I had to call back and they would get me a rate. I personally think it would be more professional to call me back but oh well. I talked to the front desk a little later and they said it would be 100 dollars, plus toll, plus tip to get to the airport, which is way too much. In a cab alone the fair would be 80-90 bucks max with tolls & tip! How do i know this? Because I found a cab and this is what they charged. In fact last time I left from staybridge suites and got a limo the charge was $75 + tip! I'm very disappointed in that I feel some type of backdoor deal was made to charge me extra. Lastly, while I was holding a few bags from shopping I got my luggage on my way to the taxi waiting outside an African American gentleman at the front desk assisted me with my bags he pulled them out of the closet put them in front of me and walked away! Come on! Help me out! I understand your not the "bell boy" but give some type of decent service I would've tipped you! Overall getting a cheap stay is always good but spring for the extra money get the uptown experience and get decent to good service not horrible service. The staff did definitely needs to be trained correctly starting with the manager!this without question is one of the worst hotdogs i have ever had.I Meant to write this a lot earlier to warn people about this hotel, but have had to deal with damage from Hurricanes Ramada Inn Eastside- New York, New York 161 Lexington Avenue New York City, NY 10016 We have traveled extensively all over the world for over 30 years and stayed in a range of lodging ranging from super luxurious six stars to rooms with dirt floors that you had to lock the doors to keep the goats out. When you go to Manhattan and pay those prices you expect a certain level of accommodation. Not a hotel better suited for some third world country. My apology for any third world county who has such a hotel. Ramada Inn - New York, New York is dirty, small and had an odor problem. As soon as you entered the hotel you are hit by wall of smell somewhere between musty and old gym locker. Our family stayed in this hotel for six days. We would have moved out within 30 minutes if could have found another room. For some reason most of surrounding hotels were booked. The lobby was small and dirty with furnishing showing their age. There were two small elevators so we had to split into two groups. My daughter got stuck between floors for almost an hour. This elevator continued to do this the entire time we were there so we avoid it. The other elevator was soooo slow. It was much faster to walk. Not sure they ever fixed it. Even now there may be some poor guest trapped. The hallway to our room had musty smell of mold. Although we had requested a non-smoking room our room had the odor of stale cigarettes and half cleaned ashtrays littered the room. I won’t tell you how the bathroom smelled. The seat to the toilet was broken and if you did not sit just right you would slide right off the toilet onto the floor. Despite numerous requests over six days nothing was done. Bath tub was filthy (could tell by the pubic hair the previous occupant was a red head) and the drain control had a jagged piece of metal sticking out is side. The grout between the tiles had a nice coating of slimy blackish mildew. This is the only time I can remember on vacation going out to corner market and buying a bottle of bleach and scrubbing pad to clean the bathroom so we could use it. Very low water pressure and at best it was luke-warm. Tried to adjust the temperature and the faucet knob literally came off in my hand. Found major dust bunnies and debris of previous occupants in the space between the bed and the wall. There was no tv remote in the room. Called the front desk and got nothing but promises. Had to wait until the occupants of a nearby room checked out and why the made cleaned that room got their TV remote. When we checked into the room the lightbulb to the reading lamp was burned out, called down to request it be replace. Said it would be. After several days and several requests and no action we went out and bought our own lightbulb. The bedspreads on the beds were in terrible condition with a number of holes you could one or more fingers through. Then we get to the really fun part- meeting the room’s wildlife. On our first night after checking in going out to dinner and getting ready for bed, we pull back the bedspread and blanket and watch a number of black dots scurry across the sheets- LARGE fat bedbugs. I even managed to capture one in an empty pill bottle. Took a picture of it for proof and I will post in the picture. I immediately called the front desk and they said they would take care of it. How they took care of it was to ignore the problem and continue to use the same sheets. The reason I know this is there was a stain on one of the sheets and it was the same sheet night after night. It not a very pleasant thing to have to strip off the sheets from your bed, take them out into the hallway and shake them vigorously to get rid of any wildlife. Were talking doing this for five nights in a row. Despite this the sheets felt itchy. Then we had the world famous game called “Chase the cockroaches up the walls as you take a shower” Don’t get too close or they might jump on you. New York Roaches are well known for being aggressive and nasty. See a race in progress in my pictures I have posted about this hotel Meeting the hotel’s wildlife continued at it Complimentary Continental Breakfast. Bagels were stale, juice had an off taste, fresh fruit had some pieces beginning to rot, flies and nats buzzing around food. Got a great picture of one when he landed on our table. I think he is smiling. What do you think? See picture I have posted. The bananas were in such bad condition they should have been buried rather then served to human beings. All it took was one exposure and a resulting queasy stomach and during the rest of our stay we ate breakfast elsewhere. Among the Amenities offered were Computers with Internet access. Which was very true if you can find one that works or you can try and use a keyboard with most of the letters and number worn off. What the hotel does not tell you is that they do not provide printers. I found this out when I was in the process of trying to check in for my flight and wanted to print my boarding pass. I was informed at the front desk I would have to use the next door cybercafe. This meant you would have to pay by the minute to use the internet. I found out later from front desk that this was owned by the hotel. Nice way to earn a few extra buck from something that was suppose to be a free Amenities. Then we come to the management and staff of the hotel. By their actions and response to questions asked and various requests by guests, they seemed to look at us guests as some sort of ill smelling bottom feeding scum sucking creatures and they were deities who like Job in the bible was cursed with the affliction of having to put up with them. Not only were they not responsive or helpful, they were ant-responsive and anti-helpful going out of their way to make the guest feel small when they dared disturbed important activities of reading a newspaper, talking to their girlfriends on the phone or just staring out the window. While the price may seem right, the experience is not worth it. There are a lot better hotels than this in the area for about the same money. NYC is a fantastic place. Why ruin your visit by staying here. Good Luck, See The World and Stay SafeFiller food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Our stay at this hotel was so awful, I frankly don't know where to begin. Each year, my partner and I host a Christmas gathering in New York City for our friends and family. This year, we chose to put everyone up at the W Hotel New York (49th & Lex). What a dreadful mistake. Quick summary: The infrastrucutre in this hotel is tired and failing. Making matters worse, management is ineffective. For those of you who don't have time to read the details that follow, I say run, don't walk, from this hotel. Tired, Failing Infrastructure: The W Hotel New York is old and failing. Three examples: 1. No more than half of the elevators in the hotel were ever in service at the same time during our stay, resulting in long waits and shoulder to shoulder crowding (the elevators in this hotel are absurdly small, at approximately 4 feet square. 2. The room key card lock system failed us during our stay no less than three times (in one instance one of our guests was locked out of his room for an entire evening as the hotel removed the door to his room, jam and all, in order to gain entry). 3. The hot water boiler had to be turned off one morning during our stay, leaving the top floors of the hotel with no hot water (ironically, a large portion of our group arrived that morning, having flown all night on red eye flights, and we had paid for their rooms beginning the evening prior specifically so that they could get in to their rooms early that morning and shower). Ineffective Management: The W Hotel New York features two "penthouse" suites on the 17th floor. My partner and I stayed in one and, to our horror, quickly discovered that the other penthouse suite (it should be noted here that both of these suites share a large, common rooftop deck seperated only by low planters) had been rented out to a major U.S. corporation as a "hospitality" suite for the Nascar race being held in New York that weekend. The result? Non stop partying next door, night after night, with people standing out on the rooftop deck smoking cigarettes and cigars until late into the night. Making matters worse, since the room next door wasn't designed to be a hospitality suite, this meant the door would lock each time it closed. To alleviate this problem, our friends next door would block the door from closing each evening by flipping the lock bar into the door jam. This resulted in the door slamming into the lock bar each time someone came or went (which was constantly throughout each night). But wait. That's not all. The bedroom of our suite shared a (thin) common wall with the service elevators on the 17th floor, which meant that each morning, after being kept up late into the night, we'd awake to the housekeeping staff coming and going (it should be noted here that this issue was pointed out to the manager on duty, who at first refused to believe me when I told him our room backed up to the service elevator -- incredible!). All of the issues I've discussed above, including the service elevator issue, were reported to hotel management. Unfortunately, management was unable to correct any of these issues. The room next door was rented, Nascar related parties were planned, and there was no turning back. The best they could do was promise to monitor the situation (which, unfortunatley, they didn't do). There are two final insults to all of this. First, in the closing days of our stay, management offered to reduce the rate on our room (I quote his words here) "by 50%, or $900.00 per night, which results in a total savings of $5,400" in consideration of the issues we faced with our neighbors throughout our stay. In response to this gesture, I told the manager that I appreciated the offer but nevertheless wanted him to understand I hadn't come to the hotel in search of cheap rooms. To the contrary, I would rather see management correct the mistakes. With this as background, imagine my surprise when we went to check out and discovered that the promised credit hadn't been put on our bill. When I inquired, this manager told me he decided not to do it because I had told him I wasn't there for "cheap rooms." When I protested, he argued with me, ultimately agreeing to credit $900 (50% of one night). As we stood to miss our flight, we didn't have time to argue further and left. Second, after spending nearly an hour checking out, we went to leave the hotel -- now running late for our flight. The bellman had stored our bags in a baggage room behind the front desk. Unfortunately, the card lock system was acting up again. We waited 15 minutes while he tried to get into that room. About the time we were ready to leave the hotel without our bags so as not to miss our flight, our bags appeared. Never again.I recently stayed @ the Holiday Inn Wall Street with my Fiance right after staying at the Chelsea Indigo and the Staybridge suites. At both those other hotels i received decent service but kept mentioning to my Fiance that Holiday Inn would be way better. I am a platinum priority club member & I travel alot for work at always stay at Holiday Inn Express and Holiday Inn they always treat me very kindly and go out of their way to make me happy. This is NOT the case in this hotel. On cleanliness, price, and location alone the hotel would receive a 3 the hotel is clean but going through construction which instantly dirties your suitcases, the price is great and by using points they are one of the cheapest hotels in Manhattan, and the location is not very great unless your day revolves around wall street and the Brooklyn bridge. Now for the service it was terrible I am a platinum card holder (the highest level) for the hotel and I dont believe i should be waited on hand and foot but I do believe I deserve to be treated respectfully. Let me start by saying there is i ONLY 1 great employee there and that is the woman in the complimentary breakfast section she is very kind and friendly. Everyone else could not make the time to be bothered. When i arrived for check in the girl behind the desk waited a couple seconds to attend to me since she was on her facebook then I was given a decent room. I wouldn't bother asking for upgrades or paying for the most expensive room all the rooms are pretty much the same with an uninspired view. The room is very small and the bathroom is even smaller I would not recommend this hotel to families but only solo travelers or couples on a budget. Since I am a platinum member I received a free "gift" bag that was made up of a bunch of flyers from local businesses, 2 waters, and a bag of cookies. Don't break the bank! Versus at staybridge i received gourmet chocolates, a bottle of wine, and a handwritten thank you card. At hotel indigo i received a credit for my room mini bar and a room upgrade. My first of many problems occurred when I did not receive information about how to log onto the internet I called down and the phone rang for awhile so I hang up called back a little later. Then second time I called back Carlos picked up promptly and gave me the information on the internet code. After seeing a mistake on my bill while looking online ($110 dollars for using my free night for "incidentals" even though with no mini bar or room service I don't know how this would be achieved) I called down spoke to Carlos where I was told he could not help I would have to wait for the manager in the morning. In our conversation I was told too calm down and let him speak even though I hadn't even explained the situation and was only talking for 5 seconds. I think he just didn't want to deal with me. In the morning I went over to the front desk to speak to the manager who was in the "back" I said I would wait. The person at the front desk continuously asked me whats wrong so that she could tell the manager I kept saying I would wait but finally told her the situation and she went to the "back" to speak to the manager. Seconds later she came back and said "Ok I'll take care of it" no I'm sorry, no were sorry for the inconvenience of charging you $110 on your vacation, nothing! Not even a visit from the manager. Finally, I went back to the room and then down to the business center at around 10AM. I first turned on the computer and had wait for it to start up, then it asked for a password to log in to the desktop that only the employees had. Luckily there was a phone in the center so i called over the front desk and they said they would send someone over. I waited 10 minutes and no one showed on my way up I saw a maintenance person who helped me turn on another computer than didn't need a log in. I began using the computer and another person came into to use the computer I told them it didn't work and that they would have to speak to someone. They too called the front desk and no one came. As i finished up I passed by the front desk to see that the person waiting for the computer was trying to explain the situation to the front desk person who not only didn't understand the situation but offered to change rooms, hilarious! Finally, I checked out, left the luggage with the front desk who leaves there bags at the front desk hours before actually putting it anywhere. I went around the city and at about 1pm I called over to the hotel and said I need a cab to take me and my family to Newark airport they said I had to call back and they would get me a rate. I personally think it would be more professional to call me back but oh well. I talked to the front desk a little later and they said it would be 100 dollars, plus toll, plus tip to get to the airport, which is way too much. In a cab alone the fair would be 80-90 bucks max with tolls & tip! How do i know this? Because I found a cab and this is what they charged. In fact last time I left from staybridge suites and got a limo the charge was $75 + tip! I'm very disappointed in that I feel some type of backdoor deal was made to charge me extra. Lastly, while I was holding a few bags from shopping I got my luggage on my way to the taxi waiting outside an African American gentleman at the front desk assisted me with my bags he pulled them out of the closet put them in front of me and walked away! Come on! Help me out! I understand your not the "bell boy" but give some type of decent service I would've tipped you! Overall getting a cheap stay is always good but spring for the extra money get the uptown experience and get decent to good service not horrible service. The staff did definitely needs to be trained correctly starting with the manager!Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Heed the reviews of this hotel that comment on the terrible services. They are not lying. I've stayed at shabby hotels in third world countries that I thoroughly enjoyed because of the excellent service. The Figueroa would be a nice hotel, were it not for the service. It began right when we checked in. I had called a few days before to request an early check-in time. I understand that it cannot be guaranteed. So when we arrived and were told that the room was not yet ready, we were happy to wait. However, the couple right behind us were told the room was not ready, but Uno (the owner/operator) told the lady at the front desk to find a room that was ready for the couple, and somehow there was a room ready. The front desk lady did not make any attempt to do the same for us, though we were still standing near the front desk. From then on we got nothing but rudeness and attitude from the staff. After dinner and a show, we returned to the hotel to sit in the jacuzzi. There was a very loud private party at the hotel. So we were not allowed to use the pool area or the bar by the pool, even though we were paying guests. When I complained about this the lady at the front desk told me I should have asked if there was going to be a party the night we were staying there, as if I am supposed to assume that a party is going to prevent me from using the facilities that I am paying for. Then a boy got about five inches from my face and told me that I have no right to complain or talk to the front desk lady that way, even though she was the one being rude. When I asked this boy (he had a uniform on, so he did work there) who he was to tell me I cannot complain, he scampered away. There were at least two other people at the front desk behind that I overheard waiting to complain about the pool being closed and the hotel policy of "No outside food or drink allowed in the hotel." Later that night our TV was not working, so they sent the same boy that seemed to try to start a fight with me an hour earlier. They must have thought that was funny. Of course I told him to leave our room so as to avoid any incident. We were told that Uno would be at the hotel at 8:00 Sunday morning and we could discuss our complaints with him then. When we checked out at 9:30 Sunday morning, Uno had not yet been at the hotel and the lady at the front desk said he may not be in. I called the next day and spoke to Uno. I told him that I have some concerns about how we, as paying guests, were treated during our stay. He asked me if I wanted him to weep for me. I'm not sure what he meant by that, but didn't think it was a good start when he had a very disappointed customer. He asked for my name and room number. When I gave it to him he said his staff had told him about me and said that I was rude and would not listen to reason. I tried to explain to him that I was not really getting any good reasons for the poor service I received. We discussed the pool being closed. Uno said that his insurance company told him to close it at 7:00 because it was dark and people may get hurt using it after sunset. (So make it safer?) I agreed that insurance is a good reason for that. But also said that is not the reason I was given when I tried to address this with the front desk (they mentioned the private party) and also there are no signs on the premises or on the website indicating that the pool area closes at 7:00. I said that my wife and I chose the Figueroa partly because we wanted to use the jacuzzi and so we paid for something that we did not have access to. Uno said that he did not think that makes sense. He brought up the fact that I did not let the boy in to look at our TV when the hotel sent him. I admitted to this and described, again, the how the boy approached me earlier. Uno said the boy was not trying to start a fight. I tried to say that he took an aggressice stance and got very close to my face, but Uno cut me off saying that I had been doing all the talking so far (though he had done just as much). He repeated that the boy was not trying to start anything with me (and perhaps he wasn't, but certainly approached me like he was) and that if his staff was rude to me it was my fault. This conversation with Uno ended with him saying he would like to terminate this converation, for some reason thanking me, then hanging up. This conversation with Uno certainly showed that he sets the standard when it comes to rudeness and disrespect among his hotel staff. Adding to the poor service, the beds are hard as boards and the showers don't work very well. The rooms are adequate, but not worth what you pay. Again, DO NOT STAY HERE. Pay a few extra bucks and stay at the Holiday Inn a block away.I booked my 24th birthday trip to Vegas for the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino because I LOVE Rock 'n' Roll music and the culture that surrounds it. I got a really good deal on the hotel's website for 2 nights, for a non-smoking King, and it is usually kind of pricey. I was a bit hesitant to use this hotel being off the strip but the website said that there was a free shuttle to and from the strip so I figured that would compensate for not being able to walk out onto the strip from the hotel. We got there about 11pm (drove 4 hours from Riverside, CA) and I heard the guy checking in at the desk in front of us and the guest services person was telling him about a deposit for however many days he is staying and also what the hotel offered, where everything is, what events are going on around the hotel etc. I kind of got nervous because we planned this trip on a low budget but when I approached my guest services woman she promised me that my TOTAL was only 177.80 and that amount would be charged to my card but my card would also be on file for any incidentals. She didn't tell us about the hotel at all though, just gave us our keys and told us where the elevator was. I thought that was kind of weird.... When we got up to our room it was a 2 Queen room. I was bummed. I called down and they said they ran out of Kings and it is first come first serve. Ok, I guess I understand that. I was told they could switch me tomorrow and put a room on hold for me and all I had to do was call or go down to the desk the next morning. When the next morning rolled around I called down and they put my on a "brief hold" which ended up being over 10 minutes so we just decided to go down to the desk. After waiting in line for about 20-30 mins we were told our room wasn't ready and someone would call my phone when it was. So my boyfriend and I decided to catch the free shuttle to the strip to get breakfast. We went out in front of the hotel and didn't see anything obvious to where the shuttle would be so we asked someone at the hotel. The lady working there told us that they don't do the shuttle anymore but the Hard Rock Cafe does which is in the parking lot. No big deal. We walked over there and saw a shuttle bus parked and empty in the lot. We went to the front of the restaurant and there was a sign that said it only runs on the weekends as of 12/14. Well, this was a Wednesday. We were shafted on our "free shuttle" which is also billed by the hotel as a "resort fee" of $7/day. In protest I wasn't about to pay a taxi so we decided to walk the mile. I am a pretty healthy 24 yr old girl and I don't mind a nice walk. I actually expect it up and down the strip but the fact that we were promised a shuttle on the website and not even told that it wasn't running is bull. When we finally made it to breakfast, I checked my bank account on my phone and saw there was only $20 in there. I was SUPER upset. Turns out, the Hard Rock took out over 2x the amount they told me they were going to. I called and they said it was a deposit for incidentals and I was told about it (even though I wasn't by the girl that checked us in). The only way we could release my funds was to have another card to put the deposit on but our family lives in MI so she said she could fax in her card and etc. We ended up walking the 2 miles (from the restaurant) back to the hotel to settle the credit card issue. We were THEN told that my funds wouldnt be released until 8-10 hrs later so basically we would be getting ready to leave by that time and it would be pointless. So, we had walked all the way back for nothing. We checked to see if our room was ready but it still wasnt. So I basically complained my butt off to this guy at the check-in counter (I was polite, but angry) and about the shuttle, he told me that "I'm from NY and I walk everywhere anyways so it doesn't bother ME" WHAT!!? That is what you tell an unsatisfied customer?! Then he told me the hotel isnt even in charge of the shuttle so its not their fault. As far as the rooms go, my reservation request is "NEVER" guaranteed and all he could offer me was a SMOKING King. He claimed that it didnt smell like smoke because they shampooed the carpets regularly. And all he could do to compensate me (after speaking to his Mgr was to refund the $7 resort fee). REALLY!?! I was SOOO upset! My bf was giving me "the look" because he didnt want me to make a scene and we just wanted to move on and enjoy our night. After being tired of walking and arguing with this guy we just settled on the smoking room. We went up there and walked in and it definitely smelled like smoke. I didn't want it to ruin my bday fun so I didn't waste my time. The next day when we went to check out the girl at the counter asked about our stay and I told her I was upset and the reasons why and she told me "Well no one uses the shuttle ANYWAY" and basically tried to make me feel stupid for wanting to use the free shuttle that was promised to me. She also told me "Its because its New Years, its not always like this". So.... what about it being my birthday the day before NYE? Am I just going to get [--] over at this hotel every year if I came back!? THEN on top of it all....she tried to say I used something from the minibar and was going to charge me an extra $4. WTF!? I swear to god... I have NEVER received such bad service from a hotel in Vegas and especially a 4 Star one! I am NOT a complainer at all and am usually a pretty laid-back girl but I felt the need to pass my experience on to everyone looking to stay here... Oh.. and the ONLY good part about this hotel was AGO, their italian restaurant. It was AMAZING and the staff was very friendly. I'm totally open to comments from others if you've received a similar experience or just have any questions for me.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

It's garbage.It took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite - I would not reccomend this to anyone that I would want to talk to me again!!So Disappointed!!!!!!!! Just got back yesterday from a 3 night stay and my husband and I are just appalled at the horrible experience. Although it was only 3 days we spent almost $1,500.00 in hopes of having a nice winter break. We have travelled quite a bit over the years and this was truly the most disappointing so far. Thank goodness we didn't stay longer. Things we liked:1 The airport is really what you expect it to look like in the islands.2 The weather is amazing for January.3 The pools were very pretty, but we questioned whether there was chlorine. The tile is blue so it looks like there is chlorine, but when put in a cup it was clear.4 We loved that there are no high rise buildings.5 The sprawling grounds were very pretty, but we expected more in the landscaping and wild life.6 The beach was fantastic. We spent most of the time just walking.The things we didn't like far outweigh the good. (This may seem like a lot of little things, but all put together made it so unfortunate)1 Since it was only a 3 day trip we were excited to arrive very early on Friday. After arriving at the airport they put us on a large bus and stopped at several hotels before we arrived at the Ocean Blue. We were the last stop made even though we had the shortest stay. The Apple rep assured me they would give us an early check in upon arrival at 1:00 PM. That didn't happen. We arrived with several other couples and they all got their rooms right away. We waited until almost 5:00 PM. Every time we checked back the line was very long and slow. After getting our turn they would tell us in very broken English the guests will not check out, so the room wasn't available yet. I didn't think as a guest that was my problem. After the last stop we told them to get us another room, so they finally did what we asked. We got a different room and were now checked in. If we had known this was going to happen we would have been prepared to have our bathing suits or shorts available. We sat in the lobby in our jeans and long sleeve shirts for hours (after all it is 32 derees in Pittsburgh, we weren't dressed for the tropics.)2 Once in our room we were disappointed because we faced the outside of the resort with no view what so ever ( no beach, no garden, no pool, no courtyard). What we did get was a large smelly dumpster to look at.3 After taking a cold shower (no hot water) I discovered our hairdryer in the room did not work. I had to go to dinner with a wet head. I couldn't wait to get dressed up, so this was upsetting. We had to call 3 times before they replaced the hairdryer while we finally went to dinner. I had no choice because it was now 9:30 and the restaurants close at 10:00.4 Our alarm clock didn't work so we called for a wake up call the following morning. We never got the call.5 Our refrigerator did not work and 2 bottles had been opened and half empty upon arrival. Gross!!!6 Dinner was terrible at Margarita's on the first night. The only thing worse than the food at the resort was the lack of service.We stood in line for over ten minutes before a hostess would even ackowledge us. Once she finally did we had a 20 minute wait. I couldn't understand because there were many open tables. I was afraid we wouldn't get served because it was getting late. After being seated we waited awhile before we had a server. The food was old and not what we ordered. The quality was very poor.7 We ate at the buffet the rest of the time, but that too was less than average. The cold items looked like they had gone bad and the hot items were very old. We didn't starve, but it was pretty terrible.8 What was more upsetting is hearing from different people that this was the premier hotel. If this was a 5 apple it sure fooled us.9 Apple tours had us picked up at 8:30 AM to leave even though our flight was at 1:00. Some travellers were late getting to the bus so we didn't depart until 9:00 AM. Then we stopped at 2 more hotels before leaving for the airport. Once at the airport we had a very long wait until departure so that was also a bummer. We got up so early just to wait . 10 The language barrier is also frustrating. I completely understand we are in THEIR Spanish speaking country, but don't tell me the resort has bilingual employees. If they were their we didn't meet any for sure. Everything was Si Senor or Senora, but then they would walk away with your request unfulfilled. 11 We are accustomed to all inclusives and know tipping goes along way. We tipped everyone we spoke to and it did not help us get better service in any way.12 The employees were completely relentless with their harassment. I didn't want to shop or buy a time share, but we must have been approached a dozen times or more which got heated a couple of times (by them not us) because no was not an option. One employee got very nasty with us and wouldn't let us just walk away. On top of it I wasn't even sure what they were asking because of the language barrier. We didn't have time to figure all of that out. I would have liked to use the spa, but their pushy behavior made me change my mind. 13 We would have liked to golf, but couldn't find anyone to ask about it. There just isn't any well explained activities. They really should put everything in writing so you know what to expect.14 The brochure said they offered bicycles, but when we tried to ask they said no there weren't any.15 We asked if we could take dance lessons and again they said they didn't offer any. Why do the websites and brochures offer these activities?16 The time sheets they do provide don't apply. For example the bowling alley said it opened at 10:00 AM. It actually opened at 3:00 PM. There were many discrepancies with the times.17 We tried to order room service just to be told by the person who answered to call housekeeping. We tried a second time to be told we didn't get room service with no explanation. He told us to go to the mini mart.18 We did lose our sun screen which was our own fault but couldn't get anyone to understand that we were looking for the lost and found. Guest Services sent us to the Front Desk. The Front Desk sent us to the Pool Bar. The Pool Bar told us to go to Guest Services. We gave up.19 After this run around we went to the mini mart to buy some. No big deal except they don't have change, they told us to buy something else to make it 20 dollars exactly! Don't expect change.20 We also tried to exchange US dollars for Pesos at the front desk. They said they had no small bills to exchange. Make sure you take small bills so you can tip throughout your stay. There were times I had to leave 5 dollar bills as a tip when a dollar or two were adequate.21 The casino was a joke! At least a 3rd of the machines were turned off or broken. The casino was so small to begin with!Oh well you live and learn. We sure did. We spent a lot of money for some sunshine and sand. Best of Luck on your vacation! Hope it is much better for you!On 12/29/2011, in order to be in close proximity to family members staying at the Delta Chelsea, I opted to stay at Delta Chelsea on Gerrard. My son and I, as well as my sister-in-law and her infant parked in your underground lot, and stood at their parking lot elevator for a few minutes waiting for its arrival in order to access the lobby. It didnâ€™t come, and one of your staff passing by asked me and a group of their guests waiting with me, if we had pressed the button which calls the elevator. We certainly had. He re-pressed the button, which oddly enough, the people behind me didnâ€™t appreciate as the â€œsuggested solutionâ€�. He said weâ€™d have to wait. Another employee walked by a few minutes later and said it must be broken. We asked how to get up with a baby-stroller which cannot be collapsed easily, and he pointed and said to me only to make a right and then follow the road up. Then he left. My sister-in-law and I directed their other guests on how to access your facility. We pushed luggage and a baby-stroller up their automotive exit ramp, where their parking attendant advised us that we should be taking the elevator. However, upon our explanation, he agreed to open the parking gate for us so we could get up to the main entrance. Then after waiting about fifteen minutes in queue to check-in, I asked for a room close to my family members who had checked in the day earlier, I was advised by the desk clerk that I couldnâ€™t get a room without two pieces of photo ID. I had only my Drivers License as photo ID. I advised that I didnâ€™t bring my passport with me as their website doesnâ€™t mention requirement of two pieces of photo ID. I asked why the clerk couldnâ€™t take any one of my four credit cards, birth certificate, SIN, Health Card, Drivers License, and various (including police security check for working with school-children) association cards. The Desk Clerk told me aloud (loud enough for other guests to hear) that there was so much fraud going on that they donâ€™t take anything other than two pieces of ID in case this credit cards had been stolen. This isnâ€™t verbatim, but itâ€™s pretty close. Iâ€™m sure you can see here where it goes downhill. Iâ€™ll point out right now that Iâ€™m a local business owner who has provided services within Delta Chelsea's facility several times. Often recommending my clients use the Delta Chelsea as their event venue of choice. I can tell you that I bend over backwards to make sure I treat my customers with respect due, and to avoid using words or actions that would ever insult them. Following what felt like a suggestion that perhaps Iâ€™m one of the vagrants who uses stolen credit cards and stolen drivers licenses, I asked to speak to the registration manager on duty. Their clerk advised me that the manager was busy. There was no pause, no looking around, not even looking at the clerk next to her for backup. She simply advised me that â€œsheâ€™s busyâ€�. When I said that Iâ€™d need to speak to her manager, even if she is busy, the registrations clerk offered that I could go â€œover thereâ€� pointing behind me and book myself in online and then I wouldnâ€™t need the two pieces of ID, I could get back in queue and come back to an attendant with a confirmation number provided online. At this time, my family members whom the clerk knew (as per my advise) were already booked-in, had come down to your lobby to pick up my son, but my sister in law and her infant remained with me at the front desk. I believe my sister-in-law was stunned and wanted to see what would occur, if Iâ€™d be denied lodging. I advised their clerk that I wasnâ€™t going to get back out of line after having invested the time and experienced what Iâ€™d had; that Iâ€™d like to speak to her superior. She went away, came back with a manager, who advised her to process the request and provide us with a full-price room. The manager advised verbally that sheâ€™d process my room request, and sheâ€™d be putting damage insurance on my credit card due to my inability to produce a second piece of photo ID. Their attendant took my Driverâ€™s License in order to make a copy of it. Came back to me, and gave me a key to room 2331. Told us to use the blue elevators to the 23rd floor, and to have a nice stay. Now: room 2331. On what was clearly not a busy day for the 23rd floor, when this hotel clearly is not full, and my family members, also on the 23rd floor have large rooms, with identical â€œtwo doublesâ€� requirements, Iâ€™m interested in why I received a corner room facing the brick wall, with not enough room to bring our baby-stroller into the room and get past the foyer while we dressed to go out for dinner. We had to put the stroller in the hallway, come in with it behind us, and then send the stroller out into the hallway again in order to leave the room. Delta Chelsea has a remarkably uncomfortably sized rooms. I just canâ€™t tell you how very unimpressed we were with the customer service and the room provided to us. I was embarrassed and affronted by their staff members, and have had my feelings justified by my witness who agreed she also felt their registrations attendant went out of her way to attempt to embarrass us. I sent an email asking to be refunded for my lodging costs as compensation for this experience, and suggested they revisit customer service requirements with their attendant so that no other customers feel insulted. I escalated when I hadn't heard back in a week. I haven't heard from their Director of Guest Services to date. On a positive note, we felt your attendants who open doors on the 29th and 30th were very quick and polite, and made up for some of the experience.My boyfriend and I visited this resort for a scheduled 8 days but ended up being 9 due to a hurricane. When we arrived at the hotel we were starving. Check in took about 30 minutes and they pointed us to the center of the lobby to what they referred to as their "resort guide" Joel. He seemed very nice and helpful at first and we honestly thought he was there just to walk us to our room...wrong!!! Along the walk, we mentioned at least 10 times how hungry we were after such a long flight and he was pointing out the buffets to go to. When we got to our building, he had us sit down at his desk for at least 30 minutes to go over useless information about a Mayan calendar! I thought my boyfriend was going to strangle him if he didn't take us to our room asap so we could go eat lol. He also wrote down our dinner reservations and said he would take care of making them at the front desk for us. Joel was then persistent to have us book our excursions with him and we hadn't even looked at our room yet. I told him we were thinking about 2 different ones but weren't sure. With this he told us that we could meet him for breakfast the next day to discuss the options and that he would give us a huge discount...sounds wonderful right??? wrong!!! He needed me to sign our invitation to breakfast. When reading the fine print of our "Breakfast Invitation" it stated that by signing, we agreed to a 90 minute seminar about timeshares at the hotel. What a snake he was to try to get us to commit to that without even telling us. He even sneakingly tried holding his finger over the fine print when I went to sign it. After this I was just mad and told him no and to give us our room keys immediately. We entered our room on the 3rd floor to find the bathroom flooded with water. I called down to the front desk to have someone come clean this up and we left to finally get lunch after 2 hours of dealing with the "check in" process. We went to the snack bar by the pool (only place open at the time) to find disgusting fly infested food. I ended up eating bread needless to say until dinner. When we came back to our room (1 hour later) the bathroom was still flooded with water. Called back to the front desk and they said the problem was already fixed. Obviously, the toilet or something was leaking if the floor was already covered in water. My boyfriend and I decided to walk back up to the front desk to talk to a someone face to face to be relocated to a different room. We dealt with Angel at the front desk who set us up in a new room after 30 mins of researching where they could stick us. When we booked, we specifically booked a queen bed room. Angel informed us that the resort was fully booked and he could only give us a room with 2 full beds that we could push together...what the hell! After going back and fourth for 15 minutes the conclusion was to give us the 2 fulls tonight and that I would have to come back up to the front desk at 8am to see if a queen room had opened up for the remainder of our trip. Angel also said they would relocated out bags for us from the flooded room to our new 2 full bed room We arrive at the 2 fulls room which was on the ground floor in their oldest building to find a mold smell infested room. It stunk like an old basement and the shower had broken plastic all in it. Surprise! Another phone call to the front desk! We wanted to just start to enjoy our vacation and go have drinks...can't do that because we didn't have any clothes! After 6 calls to the bell hop and 90 minutes later they finally brought us our bags so we could get dressed to go have dinner. We decided we were just going to get wasted so we would pass out and not realize the disgusting hell hole we were sleeping in...wrong! All of the drinks were watered down alcohol! I honestly think they use half a bottle of liquor then refil it with water...it was that bad! The plastic (broken shampoo dispenser) was cleaned out of the shower when we got back and we slept on top of the covers. 8am came and I stomped back up to the front desk to see if they had our well deserved queen room waiting for us. Yes they had a queen room available, sounds amazing right??? WRONG in order to put us in the queen room, we had to check out of our room first and can't check into the queen room until 3pm!!! So we were homeless from 8am-3pm and our luggage just roamed around the resort to who knows where. At 3pm, they gave us our key to the queen room and surprisingly it was very clean and nice. Finally thought our vacation was starting :) Went to open the fridge to indulge into the advertised mini bar...WRONG!!! Their mini bar definition equals 2 Mexican no name beers, 1 Diet Pepsi, 1 Pepsi and 2 bottles of water. When our luggage came (30 minutes later) we asked the guy about it thinking maybe they just forgot to restock ours and he said he would have housekeeping call us. I called them myself and surprise surprise that is their correct "mini bar". It gets worse...it's only restocked every other day! The next few days of our vacation went smooth until the Hurricane decided to come through. There is a Convention Center attached to this hotel, therefore, they use this as a Riveria Maya hurrican shelter. Buses of people from other resorts started to arrive and just took over everything! Due to the hurricane warning, they closed all places to eat except the main 1 buffet. We only had one more day left of vacation when we heard word about it but by then it was too late to get out of there since all flights were cancelled. We had to just suck it up and stay at the crap hole which has now double in the amount of people there. The hurricane passed but the resort never did open anything else back up. Including their business center which had their online internet access. All communication to Travelocity/Airlines had to be done on their 1 guest service phone. You would have to wait at least an hour to use depending on the amount of people. After spending $150 for one night to extend out trip we had to get the hell out of there. We took our shuttle to the airport and were willing to pay anything to get back to the US. Airtran cancelled all flights thru Sunday and it was only Friday so we went with Delta and paid the difference. The front desk of the resort was not willing to help at all and kept pushing you over to their one phone. You had to use this 1 phone since all of the resorts pay phones were out of order due to the hurricane warning! NEVER EVER EVER EVER would I stay at the 1 star resort again with their man made lagoon! They shouldn't even consider this a beach resort!Bali Hilton Facts not Fiction for the Potential Honeymooner As a senior employee with one of the Big 4 Global accounting firms I often stay in 4/5 star hotels all over the world on business trips, so I should have a moderately good understanding what is a 4 or 5 star hotel. The Bali Hilton in my opinion IS NOT a 4 or 5 star hotel, in fact I would rate it 3 or 3 plus at best. The principal reasons for this rating are:An overall lack of service, as a guest I felt that I was a type of commodity rather than a valued customer, hotel staff while not rude were not in my opinion concerned with providing services to me or seeing if everything was acceptable to me.The lack of variety of quality foodThe lack of romantic aura of the hotelA feeling that I really did not get value for my money after visiting other hotels in Nusa Dua that charged similar prices.I have detailed below my principal issues as to why this is not a 4 or 5 star hotel below. I would strongly advise anyone against honeymooning at the Bali Hilton if you are expecting to pay for a romantic holiday or alternatively are looking for a value for money holiday. My poor opinion of the Bali Hilton was reinforced when we started frequenting other Nusa Dua hotels for dinner in order to get an impression of the range of quality hotel accomodation and services available. Based on our assessment of the hotels in the Eastern Nusa Dua area I personally would only stay at the Sheraton Lagoona if I wanted a romantic holiday.My Issues with my stay at the Bali HiltonThe massive entrance and lobby that contain two bars are a pure facade, the two bars are rarely used by large numbers of guests, in the evening there is a singer at one of the bars but no one is ever there to really listen and the quality of the entertainment could be questioned.The hotel looks to be aging rapidly, both in structure and vegatation (I believe it was built in the late eigties or early nineties) and is in need of serios renovation. The vegatation and tropical plants in places appear to be on their last legs and the gardening is shabby in a lot of places particularly when compared to other Nusa Dua Hotels such as the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and the Sheraton Lagoona. The lift in our Grande Room block is not modern and regularly was out of service during our stay, which when you are on the 5th floor can be kind of annoying.Do not get an ocean view room it is not worth the additional expense as you WILL NOT be on a beach front looking out onto the sea but will be looking at the sea from a tight angle and from a distance of several hundred metres.The reception area is understaffed and the staff or assistant managers seem incapable of multi-tasking so guests are often waiting to be served while the assistant managers sit around. This happened to me on a number of occasions where I was waiting 10-15 minutes to be served.The pool is ok in my opinion and the beach is probably larger in both width and length than most of the other hotels but is steeply inclined and it is about a 30 second walk from the sunbathing area to the waters edge. Note there are no sun loungers on the beach so you are not close to the water's edge i.e. 5-10 metres away.The hotel has a massive green lagoon area around which most of the restaurants are situated, which appears to be a kind of nature area. However, certain areas i.e. the north-west corner of the lagoon start to smell strongly of sewage during the evening. I did mention this to the management.The hotel gym-workout facilities are NOT owned by the hotel and therefore are not free of charge, you are required to pay USD 4 for a day pass to use the gym facilities.Issues with our room included the shower needing to be run for 5-7 minutes prior to the hot water coming through which seems hypocritical considering the hotel's reccomendation that guests try to save water. Obviously the quality of every room may not be the same as ours. The balcony table wobbled so badly it was difficult to eat room service on it while not a major issue it was sometimes inconvenient. The TV reception quality was poor for the majority of satellite channels, I did mention this to management while I was there.The hotel does not in my opinion openly market the menus and locations of its restaurants, it wasn't until the third week of our stay that we found out where the Meditteranean and pub bar were.At the towel area you are required to sign for towels and put your room number, however when you return the towels nothing is requested of you. Why not a real is, why this process is necessary except for statistically gathering the data of how many towels each room uses I do not know.In my opinion one of the main issues with the hotel is that it has no real open air restaurants, ok the waterfall and the indonesian restaurant are open air but they are not really romantic in my opinion. For example at the Sheraton Lagoona you can have have a romantic evening meal by the beach or in one of their special romantic canopy huts, this is not possible at the Bali Hilton.The menus of the pool bar is limited, and tend to have a lot of deep fried items, I did not think that the food had a kind of care about it that would make you think it was high quality. About 10-15% of the time the staff would bring me the a drink I did not order but more importantly they did not check guests requirements that often, for example in my opinion at the pool the staff would walk around checking guests may be once an hour and generally it was quicker to go to the bar and order.Breakfast is kind of a third US/UK, a third continental European and a third Asian. In my experience the breakfast hostesses were not that friendly. The strength of the tea served at breakfast is poor as it turns a grey-cream colour when you add milk. I suggested to the manager that they put the tea bags on the table for guests to choose and have the waiters serve boiling water.We were booked into the London Apollo Hotel at Bayswater, which is ideally situated between Queensway & Bayswater stations, and a stones throw from Kensington Gardens – location wise you couldn’t ask for more. At the time of booking the hotel, I believed it was a three star & hence in our price range, unbeknown to ourselves, it is now rated on their website as a two star hotel, but when you in walk in thru their front doors all the stars have been taped over. We would have arrived at the hotel at around 6:30pm on the evening of the 1st June, 2008, which I thought was great as I would have time to check in, dump the luggage & get to White Chappell for a Jack the Ripper tour – no such luck. On going to the first room, we discovered that rubbish had been left on a bed in the room, what looked like a huge mould patch in the top right hand corner of the room, and the phone didn’t work. We had text a girlfriend of mine to say that we had arrived at the hotel & the hotel room we would be in, we text her while we were in reception before we went up to the room – she phoned the hotel from a land line from where she was staying in London & there was no answer in our room, the chap on reception told her we must have gone out, we had just arrived, & just the way the chap spoke to my girlfriend, she did ask me if he was on this planet, he was un co-operative & not willing to do anything. Hence she text us wanting to know where we were as she had tried to phone, that is when we discovered the phone didn’t work as we where in the room when she text us, so we phoned her on her mobile, I didn’t have her land line number, from our mobile, we went thru international roaming to get to her on her mobile thru international roaming, I’m still waiting to see what the phone bill is going to be, all because the chap at reception was to lazy to get off his bum. I went downstairs to - one – complain about the rubbish in the room & - two – the phone not working. He apologized in a non-apologetic way & gave us a key to another room. I went back up to the fourth floor to gather up one husband & the luggage to move down to the second floor – it was during the time of trying to go down in the lift the first time I realized the lift didn’t work on the forth floor for the down button, you had to press the up button & hope for the best. Anyway down to the second floor & into the next room. It was smaller but looked cleaner, but was a little chilly, so we decided to close the window only to find the window was broken in the hinge hence we were unable to close the window. So I went downstairs & asked the chap if he could come up & close the window for us, to which he replied that he couldn’t, he then gave me a key for another room. I went back up to get my husband, but left our luggage in the second room, we went off to the third room, which was at the base of some very narrow stairs, we walked into a very small room with a very large double bed, it was really a single room, you couldn’t move in it let alone get the luggage in. The sheets looked gray & the room was dusty & a little musty. So I went back up to reception & told the chap that there was no way I was staying in that room & I wanted to talk to the manager/owner, of which he replied that he was, so I told him that I couldn’t swing a cat in it, let alone get our luggage in there – he wanted to know what I meant, so I told him that room was too small & it was not what I had paid for, he told me that there where no more rooms available, so I asked him to find me another hotel, miraculously another key for another room was presented, to which we went off to inspect. Room number four was on the ground floor, it had two double beds & two single beds & I could close the window. The lino on the floor looked new, where as the other rooms had carpet which was a bit worse for wear, but the lino looked like it had been a DIY lay, very rough. We weren’t game enough to drink out of the cups & glasses provided. The chest of drawers had knobs broken off, but the phone did work. The wardrobe had part of the back missing & it looked like whoever swept in there swept the rubbish from the floor under the chest of drawers, I don’t think anyone had swept from under the beds since the lino was laid. The bed boards above the beds had graffiti carved into them. All I could think of was that it was for only two nights. We had trouble trying to find the light switch for the light & fan for the bathroom, the chap from reception finally got off him bum to show us where the switch was, it was floor level behind a chair. The show curtain in the bathroom hadn’t be hung correctly, so we showered with the curtain open for the first bathing session of which there was some water on the floor – we had four large towels in the room, but no foot mat for the bathroom, hence we used a towel each, one as a foot mat & one to mop up, we were replaced with two very small towels, more the size of hand towels, the towel didn’t go around me length wise & I’m a size 10 to 12, so I won’t say that I was a large person. Hence to say after getting our room sorted, it was too late to do the Jack the Ripper tour, & the tour that I wanted to do is only on a Sunday & Wednesday evenings, we arrived on the Sunday & flew home on the Tuesday evening, hence no Jack the Ripper tour - there were two things I really wanted to do in London – a Jack the Ripper tour & Baker Street – Baker Street I did, but no Ripper tour, so that has left a very sour taste & put on a damper on the only time we have ever been to London. This hotel is in a wonderful position, but it needs a lot of repairs & maintenance & the attitude problem of the chap we struck on reception needs to be addressed, there was a night receptionist chap who was quite pleasant, & another lass who was accommodating, but the first chap we struck, who also told me he was the manager/owner has absolutely no idea of what is expected by his guests, even Basil Fawlty could run rings around him. We stayed in a hostel in Edinburgh, it was wonderful & again it left the Apollo at Bayswater for dead. We wouldn't want anyone else to go through what we went through, time is precious especially when it is limited like ours was & to be mucked around like we were & to have your time wasted unnecessarily due to poor management is just not acceptable, and you wouldn’t wish it upon anyone. Not happy Jan is a great understatement Two unhappy AussiesThis place was the worst.I arrived @ 10:00 off an overnight train from Venice but was told it was too early for check in, as the room was not ready. I was feeling ok, so I happily left my luggage in the hold room and skipped off to enjoy my first day in Paris as I didnt want to waste it waiting around. In fact I enjoyed it so much, I didnt return until 16:30 after walking all about. I was tired and really ready to settle in for a shower. When I returned the gentleman who I met earlier seemed a bit confused and he told me there was an issue with my room. I begged him to just give me another room and I can swap the next day. He told me if I came earlier there would be no issue as a man came before me. So i asked him if he gave my room away? He told me no, it was an issue with the shower and it is not their policy to allow me to stay. They organised another hotel, the hotels neighbouring (3-4star) were full. I didnt bother to check. I accepted it and pushed my luggage down the 2-3 blocks to Hotel Diana 2star. I was a little annoyed when i realised it was 2 star. At Hotel Diana there was a charming and very fluent english speaking man named Damian who asked me what the problem was. I went on to tell him they had an issue with my shower. He politely smiled and told me that was a lie, but a man called before stressed bc they booked a man last minute into my room. I figured that sounded more like it. I asked the gentleman to call back to Hotel Claude Bernard St germain to confirm in french with the man that I was not to pay for this night @ Hotel Diana NOR pay for the night at all as this was their error. Also that the hotel was to pick up my belongings and check it in the following day where I was leaving early to go to the Louvre for the day. This was confirmed so I knew there was not to be a mix up. I was told to just have breakfast at Hotel Diana and leave for the louvre the next day and on return go back to Hotel Claude St Germain where everything will be organised. The next day I left my luggage in the lobby and was met by a lovely lady at hotel Diana for breakfast. She also asked me what the mix up was. I told her the hotel said it was an issue with the shower. She said NOOOO... they called and said they made a mistake and she thought it was unfair and she didnt want me b/c I was expecting a higher star rating and it was not fair on me to get a 2 star and her only roomleft was her worse room. I told her Hotel Diana was fine and I was happy that even though they made a mistake they are looking after me.. she warned me to ensure I was not paying for the night at all! After my day at the louvre I checked in with the same man from the day before at Hotel Claude B St G. I checked TWICE with him that I was not paying for the night before (not paying the rate of his hotel or the other) and that he was covering my breakfast for the error. He said yes, yes. Dont worry and apologised. He also said he was giving me a better room - which i dont think it was better than what I booked but it was clean and I didnt mind or bother. From that point I didnt mind. I thought: hey they made a mistake, but they are looking after me so fine! The rest of my stay was pleasant. The breakfast was good. THe rooms were clean. It was on check out. Luckily I decided to check out 3 hours early so I could do some last minute trip to the shops and then catch my afternoon train to London. On checkout I realised i was being charged 86euro for the night at Hotel Diana. I was furious bc the manager Paul was called and he said there was "no way I would NOTbe charged for it. It was unheard of!" I was to wait 1 hr when he would come down to speak to me. I went down to Hotel Diana hoping to catch Damian who was the french man who confirmed my no charge for the night. Unfortunately his shift did not begin until 15:00. But i checked the rate of the room was 78euro but breakfast was 8euro and I was getting charged that. (so much for free breakfast) On return for the hotel the manager was still on his way but decided out of "generosity" that they would only charge 50euro... I was livid, but decided to wait for Paul and head out to do what I planned to do for the morning. WHen I eventually met up with Paul there was lots of arguing. They used the excuse of the other man not being fluent in english... I got it confirmed in FRENCH mate!! I may be a small young woman, but I am educated and do not like being bullied by such an arrogant manager as Paul who does not honour what his employees say to their clients and tried to say how his hotel found me a pleasant place and i stayed there and survived, like it was a gift for me! You can see from his "poor review" replies that he is always returning the blame to the client. I laughed at some that I have read just before writing this. His replies always seems to have an air about making the reivewer come across like they are really fussy, real whingers and complainers. FYI-I am pretty cruisey. I was willing to let the first day all go if I was taken care of. There would have been no complaints even though I was shipped off to a 2 star for the night, made to grab my luggage and lug it down the street - something the hotel should have offered to handle! After a lot of raised voice, poor words, I gave in and demanded they just print out the statement so I can pay and leave!! This was wasting my time! I was livid!! Paul some how came to his senses (maybe after i kept threatening to write horrible reviews on trip advisor) and decided that I was leaving on such a bad note and unhappy he didnt like that so took off the charge. But not before ensuring that by taking off the 1st night charge, I would leave "happy" and not write a bad review. Sure thing Paul! So I thank the Hotel ever so much for taking off the 1st nights fee at the pleasant Hotel Diana! It was such a generous touch! I hope the hotel takes this as a learning curve & ensures their staff don't say yes yes when they dont mean it, or if they do the manager says "oh well he shouldnt have agreed to it, but bc he has, I will honour it"... or maybe just DONT give out a pre-booked room to the next guy who will pay a greater rate!?!?!? However, if the whole ka-fuffle didnt happen, I would say the hotel was clean and pleasant. Look forward to hearing Paul's response.report on the royal monceau, paris booked on my way to paris an executive room (highest room level) nice quick and easy booking on the phone. said i was arriving at 12 (ie 3h later). arrived at 12 h30, nice reception contact, but room only available at 2 pm (ok it's typical for hotels of that standing) reception showed me the bar but left me there on my own to find a seat. the usual way of proceeding is to bring to a table, call a waiter and offer a coffee so the guest is taken care of by bar staff and not left stranded. after watching half a dozen guys moving around pretending to be busy  i managed to grab somebody asking for an espresso macchiato (stressing macchiato). 15min later he brought me a very beautiful cup of espresso. seems the macchiato got left out of the equation. by the way there must have been 15 patrons at the time (seating capacity is around 60) i don't correct this as i don't want to have to wait another 15min. crowd is the usual blend of high net worth individuals, small business meetings, corsican mafia, etc... bar is pretty soulless, bits and pieces of art (books, photos, small objects,...) no bar per se (ie where you can chat with a barman) as all preparation is done behind a wall of bottles and glasses. cute but they have to get a ladder to reach the good spirits. pretty comical. had to rush to an appointment and as i asked to put my ipad back into my bag as they were keeping it they brought me to the bagage room at the back to do so. i don't mind as it's quicker but standing means you don't show the ropes. somebody should have brought it back to me and taken care of that. went back to the hotel around 5 h30 brought me to my room. on the first floor (not great but they had told me they were pretty full with the le bourget air show), right next to the fitness center (that full?) introduced to the usual systems blabla. first impression. it's colorful, there's design furniture but it's crammed. toilet is near the entrance. they stuck the bed with the mini sofa and basicaly there's minimal space to navigate around the bed. miniscule bedside tables (i mean the phone was hiding the light switches). bag is on its stool but space for clothes is minimal (only half dozen hangers and space only for that many) i know i said i was staying alone but that is really bad. big mirrors on both walls with integrated tvs (i do not watch tv so no real use unfortunately). bathroom is very large with mirrors all over the place, fancy bathtub. design appliances. they forgot about the fact design appliances are not functional.  the unit where the towels are out of the shower is actually a radiator (yes that means you burn your hands the first time you grab it getting out of the shower) and i couldn't find the switch for the drain in the sink (and i really looked as i'm an engineer and couldn't figure out where the designer would hide it). its always nice to find that out after you brush your teeth. shower is great but shower gel and shampoo are really bland. cubic push down  bottles of unmarked bland product. i came back at 12h30 and went to the bar to grab a nightcap. same waiters too fast paced to check on patrons, took 10min for somebody to show up, another 10 to ask for my drink and more than 15 to make a whisky sour. nice drink but there were few patrons so it shouldn't take that long. ( i was texting my wife so i had an exact timing) to give an example an american staying with his wife arrived at the bar at 1h10 and was told the bar was closing at 1h30. they brought them menus at 1h20, took the order at 1h30. the guy asked for a nice single malt whisky. nobody in the staff had any clue. they showed him in the end the most expensive ("very nice single malt, a bit oakey" was the commentary they gave). i left at 1h50 and don't remember seeing a glass in his hand. and by the way the first time i went out pack in hand for a smoke the staff intercepted me and asked me if i was leaving (as in you forgot your bill). not very heartening. i went the next morning for breakfast with a friend who works nearby (i had booked a table the night before but not many people where there at 9h30. was very nicely welcomed and brought to a table, offered a glass of a fresh pressed juice of our choice and some very nice coffee.  then we ordered continental breakfast with some boiled eggs on the side. eggs arrived first, perfectely cooked and presented they were delicious. but then again people were "busy" wisking around and after some time we managed to grab somebody to get us the bread and fruit salad (and again it took a while). his french was pretty limited. he asked us if we wanted more coffee and he had such a hard time understanding "cafe au lait" that we ended up asking for "the SAME please". i hate raising my voice but the guys were really useless. my friend was also really annoyed (and we are very laid back people so it takes a lot to get us to that level of annoyance) i returned to my room at 11 to find out that somebody had come and took the dirty towels and half the bed sheets and duvet cover. i was booked for one night only they have a log of this kind of stuff and they should know not to clean before check out. also i've never encountered a room half done before. either people are in there cleaning it or they are not doing it. i decided to leave right there as it felt of being told to go. in the end it was a pretty bad experience, completely sub standard, and also it's a very soulless hotel which made the experience a complete flop (i'm a contemporary art collector and was expecting a lot as it's the signature of the hotel). i have stayed in most 5 star hotels in paris and i know what one should expect for that level of price.I booked a junior spa suite at The Witt for my birthday on Friday August 14, 2009. My experience was havoc and I expressed the issues via e-mail and was provided a comp return stay with the expressions that it would be better this time around. That comp stay came along with $100 in restaurant certificates. I was very skeptical about returning to The Wit considering my previous experience and all of the reviews on facebook of others who have visited as well as the reviews online regarding the situation that is very typical at The Wit since you guys opened. I put my thoughts to the side and decided to return for my husband 39th birthday this past Friday November 6, 2009. I checked into the hotel at 4:15pm cst and upon check â€“ in the hostess did not 1) provide me with a cookie 2) share the literature about The Roof and offer a pass to attend The Roof in case of a rush. I say this because right next to me a couple was checking in and they received a 1) a cookie and 2) The hostess expressed to them that there was a rooftop lounge and offered them a pass to attend. I asked my hostess â€œWhat about The Roofâ€�? She said â€œOoh itâ€™s not typically crowded now since we slowed down so you really donâ€™t need a passâ€�. I insisted that I receive a pass and a cookie and she gave me a pass for two. I told her that I had a couple people having dinner with us at Cibomatto and I would like to take them to The Roof afterwards as well so she supplied me with another card with the number 6. The evening was set and we started with dinner at Cibomatto with a party of 8 at 7:00pm cst. We were seated at the chef table and dinner began, the food was AWESOME and our waitress Hyatt was equally AWESOME. The check arrived and it totaled $456.13 (I was a math major so I am swift with math) each of my 3 couples paid a portion on their credit cards. Couple#1 $191.50 â€“ Couple #2 $90.00 â€“ Couple #3 $129.63 & my husband and I supplied $100 in gift cards and asked that the balance be taken from the gift cards which was expressed to the server to use first. The waitress returned with all three credit card copies and stated that she left off gratuity which is fine because we know how to tip, but the question was rose by myself â€œWhere is the $45 that is left over after charging all 3 cards and taking the $100 in gift cards. She couldnâ€™t explain so she sent her lovely manager who couldnâ€™t explain either so I explained to him to take $15 from each credit card total (which equals $45) and each individual who used cards can add it to the tip line ($45 tip = 10% of check). I went on to provide him with a $100 bill and asked for change so that I can add to the tip to make it 18%. Without listening to why I wanted change he looked at each receipt and saw that so far the tip was $45 and stated â€œ You guys are ONLY going to leave $45, was she that bad of a waitress?â€� We all were in shock because first of all we were not only going to leave $45 I needed change to add the other $25 to make it a $70 tip and secondly because who asks something like that to people spending money in your restaurant. The change arrived and I placed an additional $25 on the table and left because I was just very outdone. My husband went to the suite before the bill came to freshen up so he was not there for this initial profiling situation. However when we were getting on the elevator there was a hostess putting bracelets on people to allow them to go to the roof and each of the dinner guest received bracelets except the 3 people who left out of the restaurant before the bill was closed. Once we made it to the suite my husband saw the bracelets and insisted on going to get one for himself. He did so and low and behold the manager of Cibomatto pulled him into his office to say â€œWhat did my waitress do wrong? Because the tip was inappropriate and was not even 10% of the checkâ€� My husband had no clue what he was talking about because he knows that we tip all the time so he came back to the suite and expressed what happened and I was taken back even more that this manager again insulted our intelligence and professionalism.\ We just decided to ignore it and stay in the suite and have fun so we did and a lot of friends from NY, ATL and LA were in town for my hubby birthday and at least 70% of the people stood in line to receive a bracelet before coming up to our suite. However there were 3 people who stopped at the front desk to just come to the suite and since I didnâ€™t answer the phone the hostess gave them a KEY TO MY SUITE and a pass for the ROOF with my name on it (which I still have all the passes given out with my name on them at the front desk). I find that disturbing because if I was not in the suite when people arrived they had all access to my belongings and all and I made a complaint immediately. My guest began to disburse from the suite and head to The Roof with bracelets, passes they were given, etc.. My husband and I didnâ€™t leave the suite to head up until later and once we got there with the pass I was given at check-in we were told that there were too many people from my suite # on the Roof (WHICH BY THE WAY WAS NOT CROWDED BY NO MEANS) and we couldnâ€™t attend. I immediately asked them to point these people out and they pointed out some and I said look at their arm (A Bracelet), the others I said show him you pass and they did, the others were not even with us (about 30ppl) and I asked how did you associate them to be with my group and couldnâ€™t get a straight answer however I know the answer, itâ€™s because we are of the AFRICAN AMERICAN descent and we were profiled as all being together because of that and all of my CAUCASIAN friends who came out and PHILLIPIAN friends that came out didnâ€™t 1) have to obtain a bracelet, 2) were not stopped at the elevator when entering the roof or even asked to present a card or bracelet. This to me was not a surprise because this same thing happened in August for my Birthday so I was just hoping that some change went into effect and that the RACISM would have ended due to the numerous reviews that express RACISM toward African Americans. The Wit doesn't cater to African Americans BY NO MEANS and I feel that they trian thier staff that way. All the positive reviews should be checked according to the nationality of the individuals because I posted a OPEN LETTER TO THE PUBLIC on FB and I recieved 900 comments and ALL WERE NEGATIVE about thier experience and those that responded negative were African American because that is who recieves the BAD TREATMENT.The music which is sometimes a little too heavy for my taste.Myself and my partner (we are two men) arrived at 2.30pm on Saturday where we were told that only a twin room was available and for that we would need to pay Â£15 extra per night. We said that we were happy with a double bed which we had booked and a call was then made by the receptionist and we were told that we had to stay â€˜down the roadâ€™. We asked if the room was the same standard and that it was all Ok and we were advised that â€˜yes it was a very good room and we had to stay there because the Corbigoe was fullâ€™ (despite being offered a twin room and a vacancy sign showing on the door). We were taken to The Park Hotel on 64 Belgrave Road and were taken to a room 4 floors up (very steep stairs) â€“ Room 14. This room was a very small room with a standard double bed. The room did not have any wardrobe or hooks â€“ so in fact no-where to hang clothes, no cupboards, drawers or shelves so no-where to place anything. The bed was made up with a single sheet on the double bed so only half the bed was covered and the mattress was exposed. A thin blanket and a sheet lay on the bed. There was one towel, one mug (unwashed), one spoon, coffee, tea and no sugar in the room. We were unable to unpack or hang our clothes so spent the night getting ready stepping over our cases. The kettle would not fit under the tap so we could only fill it by scooping water from the dirty mug. The kettle then could only be plugged in on a plug half way up the wall and the kettle had to be held whilst being boiled. We went to Reception and asked to change room and was advised that nothing was available. We asked for the bed to be remade with a double sheet as we did not wish to lay on an exposed mattress, we were told there was nothing wrong with the bed and the sheets were changed only once per stay â€“ after a lot of arguing we finally got a sheet and made the bed ourselves. We asked for an extra towel and again was told we could not have one, the towels were only given out once per stay, we tried explaining it was not reasonable to expect us both to use the same towel and after much arguing finally we got an extra towel, the same went for the mug. The receptionist was extremely rude and unhelpful and made it very hard for us to get these extra items, we asked to speak to a manager but was advised one would not be available until Monday am. When we returned to the room a few minutes later the receptionist burst into the room without knocking and said; â€˜sorry sirs you are right the room is terrible, I will get you a refund, the fu~~ing cleaner did not do his job properly, tomorrow I will F~~k him F~~k him..... we were completely shocked by this outburst. The receptionist continually apologised agreeing the room was disgusting and said that tomorrow (Sunday) he would get us a better room and a refund for Saturday, he had also brought with him an open plate of sugar which contained dirty bits. We had an unpleasant nights sleep in what was a dirty cold room and showered in a disgusting mouldy shower. We could only sit on the toilet sideways as our legs would not fit in front of us. That night we returned to the hotel at separate times. My partner came in and went to bed taking the key from reception (we had to leave the key at the desk when going out). I returned at 4am and after knocking continually at the Reception window the receptionist got out his bed which was made on the reception floor and advised me I could not have a key to get in but I must wake up my partner to get in my roomâ€“ which I therefore did. The following morning we chose not to have breakfast at the hotel as we did not feel satisfied that the food hygiene would be up to standards as the room certainly as not. We spoke to the same receptionist in the morning and again he apologised and said we must speak with the manager on Monday morning (Mr S...?) and he would arrange a refund for us. In the meantime he had said that he had arranged for us to return to our original hotel to a larger room with a wardrobe so we could hang our clothes â€“ all was to be in order and waiting for us. We walked back to the Corbigoe with our luggage and was told by the receptionist that we had to pay Â£15 extra for the room! By this time I was really annoyed and made it clear i would not be paying anymore. We were then taken to a room on the 3rd floor â€“ room 13. This room was larger with a wardrobe and contained 3-beds. The room was still dirty and the beds made with just a single sheet on the mattress, it was again a disgusting room , however we could hang our clothes. The beds that night were extremely uncomfortable and the towel rail fell off the wall, the Tv only had 4 working channels. During our stay I noted that every fire door was propped open and I advised the receptionist that this was not correct as the fire doors should remain closed to prevent the spread of fire, the receptionist would not accept this and said they were left open to let people in/out. This therefore gave us grave concern as we were up on the 4th floor and our only means of escape in the event of a fire was down the one set of stairs where all the doors were constantly propped open! I also noticed that some fire extinguishers required a re-service this month. That night I returned to the hotel before my partner (who had the key on him) and asked the receptionist for a spare key, he told me â€˜noâ€™ and that i had to get the key from my partner. Not being happy I insisted he opened the door with a master key to let me in, finally he gave me a key but said I must return it immediately after unlocking my door, I said NO as I did not wish to walk up/down 4 flights of steep stairs, and reluctantly he followed me up to take back the key. Again we chose not to take breakfast at the hotel. I explained to the receptionist that i wished to have a written confirmation of my complaints which he refused to give. He said i must speak with the manager but the manager was away on holiday. I have photos which I can send you showing all the above mentioned faults should you wish. I am an operations Manager for a Warner hotel so I did realise that @Â£50 per night we would be not be getting large rooms or anything special in London â€“ we just wanted a clean place to sleep, shower and take breakfast;, however we did expect a clean room and bed, towels, blankets and sheets and to stay in the hotel we had booked and not get treated rudely. We did not get what we paid for and in fact one night did not even get to stay in the hotel we booked for. The whole experience ruined our weekend as we felt uncomfortable walking and washing in dirty rooms, stepping over our cases because we could not hang anything. We tried to speak to a manager and was refused 3-times.This hotel is located approx 10 minutes from the nearest Metro station which is Manzini and in a not-so-good area which although safe to walk through, is covered in graffiti and rubbish which makes it an unappealing sight! The area is also marked by the presence of beggars which you should avoid. I stayed with my parents for a total of 10 days at this hotel and it turned out to be a complete disaster which spoilt our enjoyment of the city. As soon as we arrived we knew that our stay was going to be a challenging one-for starters the outside of the hotel looked really old and grotty. As we stepped inside we could hear the loud noise of drilling going on-essential maintenance work taking place during peak season? We were met at reception by a young man called Andreas who briskly gave us the keys to room 20. This room is on the far end of the ground floor and as it turns out is suitable for disabled visitors & so because it is a bit more spacious, it was given to us as a "triple room". We found so many problems with this room though! Although the hotel is undergoing a refurbishment programme, room 20 has yet to undergo the transformation and therefore looks ancient. Here is our list of problems: The walls had cracks everywhere (see pic) we had a standing lamp which was either not working or needed bulb replacing No bedside tables so everything had to be placed on the floor Television set-every channel had a grainy picture and only English channel was CNN and this had very bad picture quality Floor not cleaned often so dirt accumulated over days & towels not regularly changed Bathroom mirror had cracks in 3 places-whats that about 7 years of bad luck?! Shower curtain was being held with a rope! Toilet was too low because its suitable for disabled No bath or bidet The shower handle was broken and kept coming off when we turned it on! We hastily complained to Andreas about our issues but were told that we would have to wait until the manager was around as there was nothing he could do. Eventually, after much protesting, we were moved to room 14, also on ground floor . This was a marked improvement as it had a good shower and bidet and the television was in working order. However the room is located right next to reception which meant that there was much talking and phone ringing and loud entrance buzzer noises keeping us awake throughout the night! On the second day, we were awoken at 8am with the sound of drilling-yep! work being carried out at 8am! Where is the common sense I ask! The room was never cleaned during our duration and we found dustballs under the bed so it seems like they only take care of the superficial aspect of cleaning. BREAKFAST-this was very basic and economical, and in our opinion non acceptable for a so called 3* hotel. The bread was prepacked sliced of poor quality; the cheese was spread-so no sight of real cheese then. Cold meats came from packets, and cheap tasting orange juice as well as coffee from machine. On some days if we were lucky we would get fresh fruit. Of what there was, it was not enough, as we found very little ham, salami and bread so when it was gone,it would take ages to be refilled. What concerned us the most was the low spirits of the housemaid and general sombre mood of the place. On one occasion we saw the maid get angry with guests who-God forbid!-had asked for more food to be put on the table as there was nothing! After one week we left for a 3 day trip to Venice which was amazing (we stayed at the Ca Formenta Hotel which is also 3* but absolutely brilliant & worth 4*-management of Emona please take note!!!) but had prebooked a return to Emona for a further 3 days, so with much trepidation left some of our bags at reception. We arrived back at Emona at almost midnight, but had informed reception of our arrival time beforehand, so you would think that they would avoid a repetition of our first visit but-what do you know!-once again we were handed the keys to room 20!!! This made us frustrated because Andreas had deliberately saved the worst room in the hotel for us with the excuse that it was the last one-what a shabby excuse. We were treated really poorly-he was patronising to us, rude & intimidating, & when challenged, he became aggressive at us-basically a bully who didnt care about our wellbeing. One more thing to comment on was a phonecall incident. Before we used our room phone we had asked how much the going rate would be for the country we were calling and we were informed by the managing director, Maria Magdalena Wilkes, that it would cost 60 cents per minute. Later on we asked someone else at reception who gave us the same rate (we wanted to doublecheck this since there was no calling rates list in our room) so we made two 10 min calls. So come paying time Maria gives us an invoice totalling almost 20 Euros for what should have cost less than half! After much arguing she begrudgingly let us pay 7 Euros according to the rate prearranged as a "special favour" and told us that phonecalls are more expensive when made outside the hotel. This is complete rubbish as I told her that we had been using an international prepaid phonecard that gave us 25 minutes of talktime for 5 Euros, at which time she became angry & said the case would not be argued. In conclusion, this is an hotel worthy of a 2* rating, and if it had been, we wouldnt have had as much reason to complain. We were most upset with the poor customer service given by every staff member except for the young Indian chap at reception who was always very polite, helpful & attentive. If, at least, staff had been sincerely apologetic & helpful about the situations we were faced with, we feel that we wouldnt have been left with such a negative impression. One final observation: we realise that not every review on this website portrays this hotel as negatively as ours does, and we believe that this may be because half the rooms have been renovated and couples given these rooms will no doubt get a different experience to ours. In addition, the rooms on the first floor have balconies which further add. Perhaps this in itself is enough to negate one's perception of the other aspects of the hotel. All in all we did not enjoy our stay at this hotel and wouldnt dream of going back even if it was free!I just got back from a vegas vacation and stayed at MGM and Mandalay Bay gambling roughly $10,000 of total "action" with bets ranging from $75 to $1000 per roll in craps and $50 to $500 in Baccarat. One great streak in craps at Mandalay Bay made me $2,500 from $200. I'm no stranger to vegas and have stayed and gambled in many strip hotels, the only reason I gave mandalay a try was for a party with friends. The hotel was very nice we had a parlor suite that has 2 seperate bedrooms and a large living area. Mini bars are a thing of the past in vegas and when I asked my bellman why my fridge was empty(and barely cold) he said that I should get the casino host to "comp" me to have it filled or I could pay to have it filled but quote, "That would cost way too much". Even the non-suites do not have mini bars. So the big catch 22 is that it's my first time in Mandalay and the casino does not care how big a gambler you are at other casinos, I was told they have a "show me the money" attitude. So I thought to myself, OK fine, I'll just charge everything to the room and see what they can do for me when I check out. After checking in I went and registered for the all important Players Card that allows pit bosses to track your play and then comp you accordingly. I was surprised to see that this same players card works in slot machines as well(not a big slots fan but good to see that the card works there as well). So I walk up to the craps pit and cash $1,000 ans start playing $15 pass with come and full odds(3,4,5). In minutes I have $100-$300 riding on the rolls. I played every day for hours over my 5 day stay and always gave my players card to the pit bosses before I played so I knew I was being tracked. Played a bit of a baccarat as well(about 4 hours total) but craps was my main game with well over 10hours of play time during my stay. Not trusting the "charge to your room and we will comp you based on your play system" I wisely asked the pit boss for a comp after one of my playing sessions, he gave me one for the buffet for 4 people valued at $96. This must be on top of my other comps(I'm thinking). As far as the Hotel, it is very nice but everything is over priced, even the famous WOLFGANG PUCK lasagna at the "high end" italian restaurant was bland and disappointing for its $20 Price tag. Also you cant get a drink with peace and quiet. You either have to gamble and drink, or sit down at one of the many 'lounges' on the casino floor and be prepared to yell and scream to your party because the live bands are so loud they want everyone to cut the small talk, and just drink and dance and party. This is fine but I was hoping for the option of at least sitting down and having a drink with friends and actually talking with them. SO NOW I CHECKOUT: At front desk and I give them my players card. They tell me that I must take my bill and my card to the "players club" and they will write some off for me. So fine I go to the Players club counter in the center of the casino where I was told to go, but these people can only comp slot related play so I'm sent to the real Players club elsewhere in the casion, all the while my party waiting outside with my luggage. As I enter this "Players Lounge" I see another disgruntled player in front of me debating with the "Casino Host" over thousands of dollars spent with no comps, I already get worried but not letting it phase me, I walk up to the "Host" and show them my checkout bill and my players card and ask what they can do for me. They look me up and say that I've been rated as a $70 per hour player. I calmly expalin to the host that I have gambled with over $10k bankroll in craps and my bets where often in the 100-300 range with some rolls having $500 per roll. At the least they under rated me by 3x. I was then told that the ODDS portion of the bets in craps does not get rated anymore(as of last week,, gee thanks), but even then my pass line and come bets were totalling well over $100. Before I debate this issue I simply ask, "Ok well what can you do for me?". And I'm told QUOTE , "First of all sir, Mandalay Bay is the hardest hotel on the strip to get comps, I see that you had a buffet comp for 4 with $25 credit still available, but at this time I'm unable to offer you any discount to your bill". In complete shock I calmly inform the host that this kind of play at the Aladdin would get me everything comp'd. She shrugs her shoulders and sends me to talk to the pit bosses about being rated too low and also advises me that for the "future" I should ASK every single pit boss that rates me what I got rated at before I leave the table(what fun). She also mentioned that I should refrain from moving craps tables as they find it hard to keep track of me in their huge craps pit of 8 tables.(I gave my players card to every pit boss at every new table I moved too and I always stayed more then 30 minutes per table). In the end they credited my $2.56 on my $3,000 bill and were not even willing to apply my $25 buffet credit to my bill. WARNING to any gamblers looking for comps: MB is the WORST place to gamble at and unless you plan on gambling $50K and fighting for a $3k bill to be cleared I would steer clear. I am NEVER gambling at this casino again and think its a DISGRACE that this casino is not more competitive. I will be mailing the Customer Relations people and speaking to managment about this negative experience. And for those that say, "At least you get free drinks". I say: Great but 8/10 waitresses dont know what a vodka paralyzer is and all the beer is luke warm. DO NOT GAMBLE AT THIS CASINO.I'm in NYC 10-20 a year for business, staying at all levels of hotels depending on company budget, policies and deals. I know what to expect from each grade of hotel. I wound up at the Paramount due to a client deal that covered my room and tax. Even if it were free again, I'd never stay here a next time. The room: NY hotel rooms are small but smart hotels offer storage and work solutions that maximize space. This had nothing. I was in 1841 which felt like the maid's room - and as I learned from the room guide, it probably was since the 18th floor was the original hotel's attic. The room was spartan: bed, one nightstand, a chair. No desk despite sufficient space for it (also no real dresser). A sad lopsided floor lamp. There was some rolling tray table that fit over the bed or in front of the lone chair. Great concept if every guest is over 5'8". I'm 5'4" and this was completely useless, too high. I had no place to do work. The closet was entirely taken up with a clumsy two-drawer cabinet that left only a 4" space to hang clothes...space further reduced by 1/2 because the ironing board was also stored there. So if you want to hang anything longer than a shirt, you can't. The bathroom is terribly outdated, with cheap 1980s metal fixtures. The room was dirty. Not in need of dusting or vaccuuming but a deep serious cleaning. It had two nasty decorative pillows on the bed that I couldn't toss on the floor fast enough with as little touching as possible. The toilet this disgusting black ring around the bowl at the water line. The toilet should've been replaced. It looked like mold was starting in the shower. The shower curtain didn't even reach the floor so water ran out everywhere. The ceiling vent in the bathroom hasn't been cleaned in ages and was full of black dust. I hated touching any surface in the room. I had no washclothes (my colleague had them daily). I had a $10 travel hairdryer; my colleague got a full-sized one. I was so busy on business that I didn't bother to try and change rooms. And the room was simply rundown. The rolling tray table was chipped. The walls were gouged, needing spackling and repair. Several doorframes were corroded at their bases. On the very last morning, I saw that one wall had been cut open for someone to reach an electrical box and hadn't been repaired but instead left peeling and fraying. Even the room service hangtag was beaten up, dirty and frayed - it looked as if no one had been in this room in a decade. The room condition was a disgrace. It was also unsafe: the marble threshold (the piece of marble that serves as the transition on the floor as you step from the bedroom into the bathroom) was abnormally high on the room side and I tripped the first time I went into the bathroom. The height of the threshold is probably in violation of NYC laws. It took nearly 5 minutes to get hot water in the shower. So I'd turn it on, do many other things and then come back to find it suitable. And a small but important point: someone had filled the peephole with gum or something. It was unnerving. If I had decided to spend one more minute than I needed to in the room, I would've alerted the desk to have it fixed. But the dismal condition and user-unfriendliness of the room kept me out of it as often as possible. Which cost the hotel several hundred dollars since I'm normally a room service user. Instead, I ran out as quickly as I could. A final point was check-in. Because of my travel schedule, I arrived too early to get my room - which was fine - but the woman at the front desk said she'd check me in and all I needed to do was stop back for the key. She saw that the room and tax were being covered. She asked for, looked at and made note of my photo ID. Oddly, she didn't want a credit card imprint although I would be responsible for non-room/tax costs. All set, she said. I returned 8 hours later to get my key before rushing out to dinner. What I encountered at the desk: --first, the man (Sean) couldn't find my reservation --once he did, he insisted that "there is nothing noted that the room and tax are paid for" - I kept reiterating that I'd already checked in and it had shown up at that time; he kept claiming otherwise --finally he found the room arrangements note but said the woman earlier hadn't taken my photo ID documentation. Useless now to argue with him. Plus, as should've been done originally, my credit card imprint was taken --I decided to use a particular card that's both a platinum-level Visa card ($8000 a day limit) and a debit card. Sean refused to use it as a credut card - despite the fact that it's noted as such on the card itself and had he run it as credit it would've been approved - and would only take it as a debit,. Which as he explained, required that a certain amount be withheld to cover incidentals in advance. Which wasn't appropriate but again, it was uesless trying to get him to understand. While the amount was nominal (and as explained, I had no interest in generating any additional costs in the hotel), he seemed to have no understanding about such cards or in even running the card as credit to see he was wrong. I've charged multi-day stays at better-quality hotels on this particular card with no problem but apparently it was too difficult for the Paramount. Instead, this guy wasted my time as I headed to a business dinner, This place is a dump with service to match. There are numerous comparably-priced hotels in the area that are better-designed and better-maintained. Use them instead.It first came well done, and I politely sent it back.My wife and I were married on July 10, 2010 and chose Italy for our honeymoon, which began on July 13, 2010. I was very impressed with the Ambra Palace Best Western Hotel on the internet, and chose that as our first honeymoon hotel. Upon arrival, I was somewhat surprised at the appearance of the surroundings outside the hotel, and that hotel parking was 5 blocks away. This became a problem during our checking-out process. When we checked in, with our 9 bags, we were informed by the manager and porter that we could leave the bags in the area of the hotel, past the lobby, and they would be brought up by the porter. I was a little hesitant about this, but was told they would be safe. All of the bags made it up to our room safely. However, when we were checking out, after our three night stay, we brought the bags back down to the exact same location. The lobby was not busy because it was Noon, and most of the guests had probably checked out earlier. The staff knew I was leaving the bags there because I had to walk 5 blocks to get the car (not stated on Best Western.com.) My new wife was sitting near the bags, in the area provided by the hotel. However, with all of that being said, during the 15 minutes it took for me to get the car and return, my camera bag, containing my camera, camcorder, copies of all of our credit card and passport information and 3 days of honeymoon pictures was stolen; right from the exact same spot in the hotel that was supposedly safe during our check in. We spoke to the manager who told us we should have watched the bags better, and that it was our fault. That confused me because the bags were safe in that same area while we were checking IN, and neither my wife nor I were with them because we were being escorted up to our room by the porter. After I scoured the entire bottom floor of the hotel, frantically searching for the camera bag, we were told by the hotel staff to go to the American Embassy and the police station to report the theft. Upon our arrival back to the hotel, several hours later, after reporting the theft and canceling all of our credit cards, I asked if we could view the hotel's security camera tape, which showed the coming and going of people in and out of the hotel. We watched it with the manager, from the time I left to go get the car, till the time we left to go to the US Embassy and police station. Most curiously, no one was seen leaving with the bag. The bag is quite large, and would have been easily recognizable on video. It leads to the obvious conclusion that whoever lifted the bag was quite familiar with the hotel's operations, thus avoiding the security camera. It stretches the imagination that no hotel employee witnessed anything unusual, given the low amount of lobby traffic at the time we were checking out. I was also told by the manager that there was no other way out of the hotel, except for the front door. The hotel manager, realizing our situation, offered us an additional night’s stay for free. He also assisted us with adjusting a few of our subsequent Best Western hotel reservations at other locations in Italy. Despite his gestures, my memories of our stay at the Ambra Palace hotel are as follows: We were violated at a time we thought we were secure at the Ambra Palace. We lost over $1300.00 US of photographic and related equipment during our stay at that 4-star "luxury" hotel. We lost 3 days of photos (perhaps 500+) and videos which are frankly not replaceable. We lost an entire day of our honeymoon, spending it instead at the US Embassy, on the phone canceling our credit cards and arranging for replacements, and at the police station. We had to cancel our Best Western Credit Card, which would have allowed us to receive points toward future hotel stays. We were unable to visit 2 destinations we had planned for our trip. Due to cancellation of our credit cards, and the resulting lack of available finances, we were unable to purchase souvenir gifts both in Rome and Venice, as we had planned, for our bridal party back home. We had no finances until we received a new credit card in Florence, 4 days later. In addition, canceling our credit cards and securing new credit cards with my cell phone cost over $110.00 Finally, we came away from our experience with a destroyed opinion of personal safety and security at Best Western Hotels. Over the past 12 years, we have visited Europe and had always chosen Best Western Hotels. Up until July 16, 2010 I had a very favorable opinion of Best Western Hotels. That being said, however, the events surrounding July 16, 2010 at your hotel were indefensible. As I stated on the phone, and in the email I sent to Best Western International, explaining my story in greater detail, the bags were not left alone. My wife was seated in the next room, with view of the luggage. It is correct that she was not sitting with the luggage, but there were no seats for her to sit on while she waited 15 minutes for me to get the car; the seats were in the next room. The luggage was placed in the exact spot that we placed it in upon check-in, when the porter took us up to the room, and no one was with the luggage, and it was safe. Had I known that there was no parking area at the hotel, I would not have chosen that place. The Best Western website states the Ambra Palace has a nearby garage. That garage is an 8-10 minute walk from the hotel. After reportedly looking into this sad situation, Best Western and the hotel itself refused to accept responsibility for what happened within their hotel to a customer. Either there are unscrupulous visitors to the hotel, or some individual who frequently is present in the hotel was involved in this theft. The hotel and their management effectively look the other direction in not taking responsibility for crimes within their walls.My wife and I stayed the week of August 24th, 2003. We are active, physically fit, middle-aged Californians, well traveled in Mexico, especially the dive-resort vacation spots. We go for the scuba diving primarily, and have always enjoyed Mexican Resorts and diving even under less than ideal conditions (think La Ceiba back in the day!). We love Mexico, and feel that the Mexican people in general are wonderful, honest, and very hard working.Reef Club and Sun Trips booked us on the Red Eye flight from Oakland, and when we arrived after being up for over 30 hours, we were informed that our room would not available for hours. Dead tired, hot, sweaty, and still in the same clothes Get me to my room! Outrageous. The front desk staff should ALL be fired. They were rude, condescending, arrogant, untruthful, and not at all helpful.When we finally did get to our room in the mid-afternoon, we were very disappointed with the condition of the room itself. Everything was second-class. A hard but clean bed, fraying at all edges of the box spring, was adequate. Pitiful decorations hung on the wall. The bathroom mirror was in poor condition, and a very noticeable rust stain took up the middle of the floor. Towels were clean, big and fluffy. To any of the ladies who might read this, there was not a single power outlet in the bathroom. To dry her hair, my wife had to use the outlet next to the bed, and stretch over to the mirrored closet door to see herself. Very annoying. The cheapest 19 TV sat on the desk, and very loud A/C unit that mostly worked kept the room fairly cool.My wife was very happy that they did have a bathtub, but when she ran the tap, it filled the tub with a brownish-yellowish colored liquid, that was not noticeable when you took a shower.The overall condition of the property presents well, with a lush Polynesian thatched roof décor. Beware, however, of the extremely dangerous conditions of the super-slippery tiles that are everywhere. I had several serious near-falls, and saw one elderly gentleman take a very hard spill at the entrance to the upstairs bar and pool table area. The restaurant was especially dangerous, although they always put up Wet Floor signs.The pools were OK (tiles missing all along the edges), and the beach was one of the best weve seen. The guests that we met were varied, but the all-inclusive policy may have a flaw. All the booze you can drink. A group of particularly expressive Germans assaulted the pool area every day from dawn to dusk, mostly loud and drunken partiers. In the right frame of mind, they could be fun. Otherwise, they could be annoying.The worst case by far was the two young studs from either New York or New Jersey (judging by their accents). From the pencil thin goatee/beards, the dangling gold chains, the pair of earrings, tattoos, they were a sight to see.Unfortunately for everyone else, they had no understanding of how to behave in a public place, and were a source of endlessly spewing profanity and vulgarity. Every other word was proceeded by ******* this and mother ****** that. If you had the misfortune to sit anywhere near them in the restaurant, you were offended and embarrassed at being an American. The last straw was the disgustingly loud belch that ripped at breakfast on the last day. They just laughed at their own rudeness. No lifeguards at the pools and no one in charge to keep these clowns in line.The staff were all very nice, but seriously inexperienced. You had to routinely flag down a waiter/waitress for service. The food was simply horrible. Few choices, and almost always the same food, often repeated from lunch to dinner. The only way they know how to cook eggs is to burn them.I read another review about the Buticeelli Restaurant, and made and cancelled reservations there. I would have been very upset if they had charged me for eating there, but $200 for a lobster dinner at an All Inclusive is just too much. Yes, the power went out, the TV cable went out, but I expect that in Mexico, no big deal.As for the diving, the Dive Staff on the premises is good. Some good personalities and a real effort to make things go right. To be honest, the diving was not that good, especially compared to Cozumel, just 40 minutes away. The weather was stormy, and the visibility was about 50 feet. The dive boat was crappy, but they did not overfill it. The ladder was broken, so you had to take off all equipment in the water every time you got back onto the boat. Service on the boat was non-existent except for the help you got checking your equipment. I asked the Captain if he would hand me my camera after I rolled into the water. He looked at me with disgust, grunted out loud, and pointed to the back of the boat, whatever the heck that meant. Sorry, my mistake. One of the non-diver guests helped me out.In all of our dive experiences, they always provided plenty of liquid refreshment, including water, juice, and soda, as well as an assortment of breads, croissants, cheeses, and cold cuts, for between dives. Here, you were lucky to get warm bottled water, and they always ran out before the trip was over. They even ran out of air tanks, and the photographer could not go on the last dive. Organization not a strong suit.Dive masters were good, with Van leading the pack. He has a real good touch with the kids so he is the guy if you want you son or daughter to take up diving. Manuel was good, but was so laid back I could swear he actually fell asleep underwater during our drift diving, hands folded across his chest, eyes closed, floating exactly two or three feet off the bottom, with perfect buoyancy control. Ricardo took pictures, and did a good job for a very reasonable price.We took several trips into town and were routinely accosted by the locals plying us with free this and cheap that, always sounding too good to be true, but when you asked a question or two, you found that sure, you would get the deal, but had to sit thru a time-share presentation. As if. One particularly suave gentleman stopped us on the beach and had us fully engaged, and was teaching my wife to speak to me in Spanish in a fun and very romantic manner.He liked us so much that he invited us to breakfast the next morning, and he would comp us at any event, whether excursion to the ruins, and full dive trips. WOW! Really, youll pay for us to go diving in Cozumel? Sure will, be here in the morning and after the presentation presentation? What presentation? Oh, didnt I mention, you get the freebie AFTER the presentation. No thanks. Ive heard that this presentation can be very forceful, and stressful, trying to get you to sign up for a time-share.Well, enough already, if youve read this far you must really want to go, so go and try and have a good time. My suggestion, save a few more bucks and go to Columbus Isle in San Salvador to relax and dive, or try Cozumel if you really want Mexico and diving.Could have had better for 1/3 the price in Chinatown.First, the pros: It's beautiful, it's just a short walk to Epcot from here. That's it. I booked a 3 night stay at the Florida resident rate directly through Disney which gave me a 36% discount off the regular rate. The villas are so costly that this was still an expensive stay even with the discount. I was at the hotel for a total of 7 hours before getting angry enough to check out at 11:30 PM and go to another hotel. First, the parking....the hotel parking lot was designed for one purpose only...to get you to pay an extra $!0 per day on top of the expensive room rate so you don't have to walk quite a distance to the hotel's front entrance. Even the handicapped parking is far from the front entrance. Upon arrival, I pulled up to the valet area where I was ignored so I asked if I could leave my car there until I checked in. A valet took my keys and told me I could do that. At the check-in desk I encounter Cast Member - Raymond who although he's been working at this hotel for a while (as told to me by another Cast Member) knew very little information about it. I asked if I could upgrade to a room with a kitchenette because I hadn't realized until the night before my arrival, that the room I booked onilne only had a microwave and small refrigerator. I was unable to change my reservation online at that point. He told me that they did have a 1 bedroom villa with kitchenette available and after much fuss on the phone to see what the extra fee would be to upgrade, he told me it would be an extra $115 per night. In the few seconds that I was contemplating this, he received a phone call, and then told me he was sorry but he told me the wrong price and that it would be $238 per night to upgrade because they couldn't give me the FL resident discount rate at the hotel. (WHAT??!!) I started to get annoyed at this point and in the few seconds that I was contemplating what to do, another Cast Member came out from behind a closed door, looked at me and said "I'm really sorry but we just sold the only 1 bedroom that was available while you were deciding what to do. NOW I was angry. I said "this is ridiculous, what is going on here? For medical reasons, I need the kitchenette to prepare my own food, I've been here less than an hour and I'm already very aggravated, perhaps I shouldn't stay here at all." A manager that was nearby heard the conversation and whispered something to the Cast Member that came out to tell me the bad news. SUDDENLY....a one bedroom villa with kitchen became available and at the Florida resident discount rate. How about that!!?? Unfortunately this wasn't the end of my misery. I check in and return to the valet area to see about having my luggage taken to my room. A Cast member at the valet booth tells me to "talk to that guy over there" so I do and he walks over to my car with me when I realize I don't have my keys. I go back to the valet booth and they don't know where my keys are. They find them but by then the bellman that was going to help me had walked away from my car. Someone directs me to the bell stand just inside the entrance and I get help with my luggage. I tell the bellman that I'm going to park my car and meet him at my room. This hotel is so large and built in such an odd way that it's difficult to navigate. Raymond gave me the wrong directions on how to get to my room and I quickly became very lost and unable to figure out how to get to where I was supposed to be so I called the front desk from my cell phone. Two cast members came to assist me and they said "this happens all the time here." Hmmmm.....if it happens all the time, don't you think they should do something about that?! Finally both my luggage and I are in the room. I'm exhausted, it took over an hour to complete check in, park my car and find my room. The room is beautiful and very spacious but that's all it is. There is advertising everywhere you look to join the Disney Vacation Club, including on the TV. And I do mean everywhere! The kitchen table had large stickers all over it with these ads and you see them throughout the hotel. I had difficulty finding a TV channel that was NOT advertising something Disney. I went out for a while and when I returned to my room and attempted to use my laptop, I found a sign on the kitchen table that said to look for an ethernet cable in the closet (there was no cable) and that there was a $10 per 24 hours fee to use the service. I was enraged. This was the most expensive hotel I've ever stayed at and they were going to charge me to use the Internet? No they weren't as far as I was concerned. I called the front desk, reported that there was no ethernet cable and that I wished to have the fee for the Internet waived. I was told they "COULDN'T" do that so I asked to be connected to someone who could. I was told that the manager would call me back. About a half hour later, the manager called. He asked me: 1. "Why do you think the Internet should be free?" 2. After explaining that I've stayed at many lesser priced hotels that all had free Internet, usually WiFi, he said "Well if you stay at a Motel 6, they give you free Internet to get you to stay there." I've never stayed at a Motel 6 that was his assumption. After arguing with him for a while and telling him that if he doesn't wave what would amount to $30 for Internet use during my stay, I was checking out immediately and never coming back. His reply was "well, I hate to put you out at 11:30 at night, is there anything else I can do for you? I replied "yes, you can let me use the Internet without charging me. His response was "I'm not WILLING to do that." I quickly found a very lovely Holiday Inn Express on Palm Pkwy. in Lake Buena Vista for $85 per night offering free WiFi, free breakfast, very lovely, clean rooms and helpful management. A few days later while investigating who at Disney I can report my horrible experience to, I found that the Boardwalk Hotel has free WiFi in the lobby and they have a business center. At NO TIME did anyone tell me that.The truth ArrivingWhen arriving in Punta Cana Int'l Airport, I highly recommend getting the VIP service offered by the hotel. Someone greets you at the plane and expedites your trip through customs while also summoning a porter to help with your bags. I was very impressed with this service and thought we were in for a great experience.The cab ride over was uneventful and a charming driver gave us the highlights as we made our way.Check InOnce there, we were greeted by a friendly porter and ushered to check in. Everything was explained and we were asked to leave a deposit of $25 for the safe deposit key. The staff was uncomfortably inattentive and somewhat laissez-faire about answering my questions. We did receive some cold washcloths for our faces which was a nice touch. Also, the hotel has a standard conversion rate for DR pesos to US Dollars. Everything for sale is in US Dollars. This is so they can maximize the exchange. If you think the DR is a cheap travel destination, think again, this hotel does everything to nickel and dime you and over inflate their prices to reflect common US charges, i.e., a cocktail or beer will run you $4-6 and a hamburger will run you $8. Nothing is cheap here. If cheap is what you're looking for, rent a private villa that come with cooks and maids. It's much more efficient.Room We were checked into our Deluxe Suite which was two floors. The room had marble flooring but the furniture was very worn and in need of replacement. The fixtures in the bathroom were also lacking as well as the fluorescent lighting throughout. Once upstairs, we discovered that the AC wasn't working. I notice a previous review mentioned the same thing. The bedding was akin to something you'd find in a cheap motel. The sheets were very thin and the pillows were very small. Don't expect the heavenly bed. We were very uncomfortable when it came to sleeping. After calling to complain about the air, they sent a crew who re-charged it only to have it blow warm 2 hours later. It took us all afternoon and evening to finally get another room. When we spoke to the front desk, they were very unhelpful. At this point, I wished I were home. It was no way to start a vacation and left my wife and I with the impression that once they have you there, they can treat you how they wish because they know there's no where else to go and you've already paid. This was a recurring theme when it came to service issues.Also, be prepared with bottled water. All the water on the property is non-potable. Don't brush your teeth with it and try not to swallow any in the shower. The pressure in the shower and sinks was abysmal. Be sure to rent a golf cart as the property is expansive and to see it all, it's beneficial to have your own transportation.Getting Around ResortWe found the golf club to be the most relaxing spot. Not only was the pool less crowded, they had a very attentive wait staff that served lunch and beverages. The grounds themselves were very tropical but I do feel the resort could do a better job of cleaning up the debris in the less trafficked areas.FoodThe food was a real disappointment all around. After trying the different restaurants and then the buffets, we really were dissatisfied. All the restaurants were open air which left for a very muggy dining experience. The food on the buffet reflected the temperature as all the breads were soggy, the cheeses overcome with precipitation, the cereals mushy, and the overall dessert bar unappetizing. Everything seemed to sweat except for the hot dishes which were unappetizing in the warm setting. For breakfast, you can wait in line for a custom omelet which was good. At night, the pasta station also had a long line but with slim offerings. Neither sauce was that appetizing. There was a red sauce and a cream sauce and you had a choice of bacon, onions or garlic. Warning: Almost every morning, the hotel allows merchants to set up right outside the main dining entrance. They haggle you and beckon you to see their goods. It is very uncomfortable the way they approach you and hound you. Tip: Avoid them by going in the back entrance. I found it hard to believe the hotel allows them to harass their guests. Besides, the crafts were over priced and not that appealing.The best food we had was at lunch at the golf club. We had grilled kabobs served with french fries. Not my idea of a great lunch anywhere else but when I tell you, the food was the pits all around, take it from me. DepartingYou have to check out at 12 regardless of your airline departure. They nickel and dime you ever chance they get including leaving. For every hour you're there past 12, they charge you $20. I went to check out and requested a printed receipt of all my charges. Be sure to keep your receipts for all your transactions. My total and there's conflicted by nearly $100US. At this point, all the staff shuts down and acts like they don't understand. I also learned that the $25 deposit for the safety box wasn't standard and they asked me who asked for it when I checked in. Luckily, I remembered the guy's name. They still didn't believe me. At this point, I caution guests to ask for receipts for any extra charges. I found it unfathomable that the staff would do this to their guests and risk losing their jobs. Needless to say, I couldn't wait to go home. This had to be the worst vacation ever. It's good if you're in college and don't care about these things but for the money, I would expect better.We were staying in the Orlando area for two nights, and saw a promotional rate for Mike Ditka Resorts Runaway Beach Club through livingsocial.com and figured we give it a try. When we arrived for our two night stay, we went in to our unit and were pleased by the fresh bleach scent. The unit appeared to be as shown on the web site (2 Bedroom Luxury Villa) and in good shape. For the money, there really wasn't a lot to complain about. A king size bed was in the master, two beds in the second room and a pull out sofa bed. We unpacked after our long trip and noticed in the second bedroom there was a blade missing from the ceiling fan and the master bedroom had no chain to shut the fan off. Well, not the end of the world, but come on. Well, we were tired and just wanted to relax. We turned the kitchen sink on to wash a few cups and unfortunately the sink faucet was leddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddaking pretty bad and flooded the counter. We called the front desk and within minutes had a maintenance person there to assist us. He couldn't repair it with us there so they moved us to a different unit. We arrived at the new unit and this time instead of a fresh clean scent, we were hit by the stench of cigarettes. Despite the smell, the place looked pretty clean, we were tired and so we stayed. So, now we get ready for bed, pull down the very worn duvets and notice some serious issues. The twin bed's box spring was absolute falling apart. Literally, the stitching was completely undone, the foam and cloth cover was off and under it was cardboard stapled to what was left of the box frame. We turned to the double bed and the box spring cover was intact, but the box spring itself was broken and bent, offering no support to the lower portion of the bed. The pullout bed was missing several springs and my 5 year old daughter actually fell through when she sat down on it. She ended up getting sandwiched in half between the frame and mattress support. For small children this is a serious injury waiting to happen. We called the front desk and asked for the manager to come to out unit to see the overall condition. We were of course told the cleaning crews noted no issues with the unit and she seemed to imply we must have done something. I quickly put an end to that implication, but she still refused to come to the unit. I was told a maintenance person be over to look at it. The guy arrived and said he'd have to go see if there were any more beds, which was a stall tactic. As we later found out, these units are individually owned timeshare/condo type units which are managed by Geneva Hospitality and marketed under Ditka's name under license. Any purchases would have to be approved by the unit's owner which wouldn't happen for days or weeks. A short while later we called the front desk again and were told it was too late in the day for them to do anything and there were no other units available for them to move us in to. I told them they needed to give us some credit or completely comp the stay because this was rediculous. I was told I had to speak with Katie Rondon the Customer Relations person in the morning and that she was the only person who could do anything. At this point we had no choice but to deal with it. I figured I'd try to make the best of it, so decided to spin the box spring on the double bed so at least the broken portion would have some support. I lifted the mattress and to my disgust there was a used comdom laying there on the box spring. YES, A USED COMDOM!!! In 16 years of business travel including several 3rd world countries, I've never been presented with such appalling sleeping conditions. This was absolutely inexcusable. Morning came, I called the front desk and of course Katie Rondon was "unavailable". I called back again and after a pause was told she was "on a conference call" and I would get a call back. 45 minutes later, still no call back, so we decided to go pay her a visit. Katie wasn't on the phone and was sitting at a desk in the office just to the left of the front desk, so it was hard for them to make any excuses. I explained the room conditions and asked her to go see it with us. She of course refused and said there's nothing she could do to credit us or comp the stay. Since she wouldn't go to the room, I showed her photos and told her of the used condom under the mattress. Amazingly she didn't seem to be in the least bit phased by it. I can only assume it's a common occurrance. Her only comment was she'd go to the room later and take her own photos, send them to her management and we should hear from her by Friday at the latest (it was Tuesday). That's it! No apology, no empathy, no nothing. NOTHING!!!!! Friday of course came and went and we never did hear from Katie Rondon or anyone else from Mike Ditka Resorts Runaway Beach Club, or Geneva Hospitality. SO....IF your expectations are low and you have no reasonable expectation of service should ANYTHING go wrong, you've got yourself a great place to stay. But if you have any reasonable expectation of quality and service, do yourself a favor and as the name suggests, "RUNAWAY" from this place. With so many other options in the Orlando/Kissimmee area it's simply not worth the risk or hassle. Some other notable items: The kitchen's ceiling was peeling and damaged due to a water leak from the unit above. "top of the line appliances" - Were not so top of the line, especially the 700watt efficiency apartment sized microwave so small you could barely get a bag of popcorn in it. "32” flat view televisions" - Don't get these confused with modern flat panel HDTV displays, these are the 1980's Sony flat screen tube televisions. "Gourmet Coffee Maker & Starbucks® Brand Coffee" - This was a $17 Mr. Coffee Coffee maker and 1 bag of S&D Hotel Coffee (NOT STARBUCKS).Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.We stayed at the Mirage from 4-6 Jul. This was our first visit to Las Vegas and our experience at the Mirage totally ruined our trip. Here's why we will NEVER again set foot in the Mirage: 1) We were assigned a room that was already occupied by another guest Upon opening the door to our room, we discovered that it was already occupied by someone, who, needless to say, was none too pleased to have 2 strangers barging in on him while he was in bed. It was an extremely embarrassing incident for both us and for the poor person we intruded upon. However, more serious a matter than that of embarrassment was the utter lack of security in the hotel. Had that guest not been in his room, and had we been so inclined, we could have easily walked out of the room with whatever money and valuables he left in the room, thinking that they would be safely locked up in the room. To compound matters, when we went back down to the front desk, the staff did not appear the least bit alarmed that such a grave mistake had been made, and blithely issued us keys to another room. This encounter led us to conclude that the Mirage must frequently make such errors, given the lack of concern displayed by the staff. 2) We were assigned the wrong room (again) Upon entering room number 2, we discovered that there was only 1 bed. We found this to be unacceptable, as we had been told when we had tried to check in earlier that afternoon that a room with 2 beds would only be ready in 2-3 hours, and we would have to check in later that day if we still wanted a 2-bed room. Hence, when we returned later that night to check in, we were fully expecting that the hotel would honour our request and give us the room we wanted. We called to ask for another room, and were told that someone from security would meet us outside room number 3 to let us in, so that we would not have to make another trip to the front desk to collect new keys. However... 3) We were assigned the wrong room YET AGAIN We met security at room number 3. He opened the door to reveal a room with 1 bed. After another angry call, we were eventually given a room with 2 beds, and offered a $75 food and beverage credit. Needless to say, our faith in the Mirage and the level of security proferred to its guests had been severely undermined by then. As such..... 4) We could not enjoy our day trip to the Grand Canyon due to constant fear and worry about the security of our possessions While on our day trip to the Grand Canyon on the 2nd day of our stay in Las Vegas, our minds were preoccupied with the constant fear that our possessions in our room were not secure and we were unable to fully concentrate on and enjoy our visit to the Grand Canyon. Our fears were not unfounded, as it seems, because upon returning to our room that night after the trip to the Grand Canyon, we discovered that... 5) Both our key cards didn't work. And there were 2 empty champagne glasses sitting just outside our room In light of what happened to us the night before, the only conclusion we could come to was that the staff must have assigned our room to another guest or at the very least that someone else could possibly have entered our room with the wrongful authorisation of the hotel. When we went to the front desk to demand an explanation for being locked out of our own room, we were further agitated because the staff merely offered to have housekeeping clear the glasses and issue us new keys, and did not appear to understand why we were so upset. When we asked why we should believe, after what had happened the previous night, that it was not possible that our room, or access to it, had been erroneously given to someone else, the staff were unable to give us any satisfactory assurance or justification, and could only insist that we were the only guests registered to the room. After our extremely unpleasant experience the night before, we could hardly have been expected to believe that claim. 6) While checking out, we were told that someone named Medina Maribou was also registered to our room and asked to confirm which credit card to charge the bill to This, after the repeated assurances from the staff the night before that we were the only registered guests. We promptly lost every last little shred of faith we had in the ability of the hotel to get things right. In fact, we can only hope desperately at this stage that our credit card does not remain on the hotel's records and has not been wrongly assigned to someone else's room. 7) Our bill wrongly included charges of $70+ spent at one of the hotel restaurants This error seems minor in comparison to everything we had been put through, and the front desk removed this item from our bill readily enough after we pointed out that we had been given a $75 F&B credit. However, we would have expected more care to be taken, given our numerous complaints in just 2 nights. On both nights, because of the Mirage's errors, we went to bed very late and slept very little and badly. We ended up being very tired on the respective days following and were not able to enjoy our visit as much as we had hoped. We have a right to expect, when we pay for accommodation at a hotel, that we would at least have a pleasant and restful night's sleep, and were deeply disappointed that a reputable hotel like the Mirage could fall so dismally short of such an indisputably reasonable expectation. While we did appreciate the Mirage trying to make up for the rotten experience by giving us a $50 discount, most would agree that this gesture was too little too late. As fairly frequent travellers, we have stayed at hotels all over the world and we assure you that we have never had such a singularly unpleasant experience. We are not particularly hard to please or exacting and have given rave reviews about exquisite service and facilities in some hotels that would look like huts next to the Mirage. Unfortunately, should anyone ask about our visit to Las Vegas, we will not be able to say anything nice about our stay at the Mirage, which has ruined our impression of Las Vegas and of tourism standards in the United States. Most critically, in the high-security climate of today's world, especially in the United States, the last thing we would have expected would be such serious breaches of security and such a lax attitude towards security. It most certainly defeats the purpose of having stenuous security measures at higher levels if corresponding actions are not enforced at the ground level. We would most certainly advise all our friends and family to opt for alternative accommodation when visiting Las Vegas, as from our experience, the Mirage is an establishment that could pose a definite danger to their safety and security.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth.

The condos are big in size and very spacy. The light over the bathtub burned out a day before we left and I had to flick the circuit breaker at times to get the AC going in the room. The worst part was that our DIGITAL CAMERA WAS TAKEN FROM OUR ROOM during our stay. It was taken anywhere from the last night we were there (8-12-07) until about 2pm the day we left (8-13-07) I know this camera was taken by someone with access to the room seeing that the doors lock automatically when they shut and I personally always check the door when I leave. I remember clearly that the camera was in the living room next to the couch. This is the story of my missing camera. We spent Sunday (8-12-07) next to the pool. I remember I took some pictures of my wife going down the hotel slide at approximately 5pm and not more than 5 minutes later we decided to go back to our room. My wife was feeling a little under the weather ( too much sun) so she layed down on the bed and I sat on the living area couch where I was reviewing our pictures of the week and thinking of how much fun we had. Shortly after looking at the pictures. I placed the camera next to the couch. I then grabbed my wallet, left the hotel and went accross the street to the stores to pick up some post cards and a few souvineers. I then returned to the condo to see how my wife was feeling. She said whe was still feeling a little ill and sleepy so I decided I would go down to the tiki lounge for a little bit. My wife came down about an hour and a half later. Shortly after that we went back to the room and went to bed. Our check out was the next day. We left the room at approximately 0945hrs. We met our maid on the way to the front desk. She looked at us and asked us if we were leaving and we told her yes. She told us to come back and visit her soon. The hotel called us a taxi and we waited just outside the lobby with our luggage for about 1/2 hour until the taxi arrived. On the way to the Amtrak station I realized that I didn't pack the camera and asked my wife if she remembered packing it, she said she did not. At approximately 11am we got to the Amtrak station. We pulled our luggage out of the taxi's trunk and double checked to make sure the camera didn't fall out. We then opened our suitcases to see if the camera was in any of them. We emptied them and we found NO camera. I immediately called the front desk and told them I think I left my camera in the room and asked if they could send someone up to our room to check. I gave them my cell number and they said they would call me back in 15-20 min to let us know if they find anything. We were anxiously waiting for there call for close to an hour when I decided to call them back to get an update. They said they were in the process of getting the housekeepers to check the room and they will call us back in a little bit. I waited ANOTHER 35 MIN and got no call by this time I was a little bit irriated because all of our honeymoon pictures were on the camera. I called them back and they informed me that they had to get the security department to check the room. I waited another 15 minutes and then I decided to call them and inform them to send someone up to the room we stayed in to check for the camera right now. At this time they informed me that the housekeeping and the security checked the room and found no camera. They said they would call me if they find anything. I was irate because I knew the camera was in the room on the floor next to the couch. I told them to double check that area and after a little bit of an arguement they agreed to double check the area I mentioned (so they said). They said they would keep looking for the camera and call me if they find anything. Sometime hours later while on the train I noticed that I had a message. It was the hotel and they said that they couldn't find the camera and they did all they could I CAN'T FATHOM THE FACT THAT THE CAMERA WAS IN THE ROOM AND IT HAPPENED TO GROW LEGS AND WALK AWAY. The maid seemed friendly enough but asked us 3 or 4 times during the week when our last day was. I didn't think anything of it at that time but now that the camera was last seen the night before we left makes me suspicious. When I returned to Boston a day later I called the hotel and asked if the hotel manager was around. The receptionist said I just missed him and he just stepped out for a minute. I then asked if they found a camera in the lost and found and her attitude changed once she found out it was me calling. She didn't even check she just informed me that they did everything they could and there was nothing else possible. I asked her to have the manager call me. The next day the manager of the hotel called me. He informed me that they looked everywhere for the camera and couldn't find anything. I told him that I've been doing security work for 8 years and asked them if they checked the door readers to the room to see who went in there. I also asked him to check the cameras and see if you could find anything suscpicious. I told him that if they review the cameras he should have seen me coming into the hotel from the rear door with the camera around my neck on Sunday 8/12/07 at approximately 5pm and when I left for the stores through the front lobby without the camera around my neck at approximately 7pm. He then told me that he considered this case closed as of now and there is nothing else he could do. He said he can have security look at the cameras and let us know if they find anything. It's been 1 week and 1/2 and I haven't gotten a call yet. I will be reporting this further even though I don't care too much about the 150 dollar camera. It our HONEYMOON PICTURES THAT I MISS.Ruined my Honeymoon!! Where to start? We arrived in Honolulu Thursday 3/15/07 to prepare for our Sunday wedding. We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village with no issues. That night I called the Outrigger Waikiki on the beach to confirm our request for a king bed and partial ocean view. The first time I called the operator accidentally hung up on me. The second call I was transferred to nowhere and the line rang for minutes. The third call, I was told quite rudely that my reservation had been canceled. The hotel refused to give me any more information and said I had to deal with the booking agency. It took two days to sort out, and instead of enjoying all the festivities leading up to the wedding I spent the time worrying about where we'd stay for the honeymoon. It turns out the hotel had my first and last names switched, and I had proof that it was booked correctly.When we arrived at the hotel, the staff was cold and unwelcoming. Our room was wrong, as they had given us two double beds instead of the king we had requested months ago. We were supposed to have chilled champagne and treats waiting for us in the room and that didn't happen either. When I contacted the hotel the woman I spoke to argued with me about what came with my package. I had all the correct paperwork and was perfectly willing to show here, but she said fine! and slammed sown the phone. It was in the room waiting for us when we got back from dinner- warm, with no treats. The room smelled old and dingy. The furniture was dusty and by the look of the bathroom we were happy that we brought Clorox wipes. We were on a low floor and our balcony door didn鈥檛 lock, so we had to lock up all our belongings well anytime we left the room and hoped the bags would be there when we got back. And no, the hotel did not do anything to help us with this one either.The walls are very, very thin. We were woken up every morning by 6 AM by doors slamming, children running around, and adults talking. The first morning at 5 AM a school-aged boy was screaming so loud and painfully we called security because we were scared. It turns out that nothing was wrong and he did that a lot. That was for the first two days. The second two days had another family next to us with a bunch of kids crowded into the room. We could hear everything. We kept our privacy please sign on the door at all times when we were in the room, but housekeeping still knocked and woke us up. They did not take care to keep their voices down, even when they started at 8AM. I travel a lot, and this is the loudest hotel I've ever been in!!The room was booked under my maiden name, but we gave specific instructions when we checked in about our married name. The morning newsletter said welcome Mr. and Mrs. 'Maiden Name'! I was crushed because I wanted this for my scrapbook. I asked for them to change it and add it to the next morning's flyer. They complied, but were not nice about it.The first morning after the first night I went down to speak to the manager. We were exhausted and not enjoying our honeymoon at all, due solely to the Outrigger. I spoke to the Guest Services Manager, Brian, who looked and acted like he could not have cared less. He stared blankly at me while I explained our situation. He offered to move us, but could not accommodate our special needs (king bed, at least partial ocean view). I told him I wanted Outrigger to make a gesture to show that they appreciate our business and care that our honeymoon was being ruined. Even after telling him we like to sleep in and stay out late, he said the best he could do was breakfast coupons. I'm not complaining about getting something for free, but I wondered if he had heard anything I had said about sleeping in. In order to use the coupons we had to get up early. Good thing our thin walls helped us make it on time.There were other issues as the weeks progressed that I won't add, but the worst part is that I wanted to speak to another manager and never got the chance. I called and went to the front desk every day and the answer was always he's in a meeting or I'll have him call you. He (or she) never called and apparently is still in the meeting. Right before we left the hotel for the airport my new husband tried again. He had about as much luck as I did, but he was promised a personal letter of apology for all we experienced. I we do not receive that letter of apology we will report this hotel to the Better Business Bureau.The big picture of this hotel is very thin walls, unaccommodating staff, overcrowded with kids, and being told no everywhere you turn. I will never go back to this hotel, much less any Outrigger. We stayed also stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the JW Marriott Ihilani on this trip and had no issues whatsoever.This is the most horrible dump of a hotel I've ever had the displeasure of staying in. The general appearance of the entrance way and parking lot makes the property appear to be a remnant of a burned-out urban strip b/c the lot is sort of empty and torn up with weeds growing through the asphalt of part of it. The lobby was deceptively well-appointed. The check-in process took over 50 minutes when there were 3 people in front of me checking in, one of which was making incredibly intricate arrangements to rent multiple rooms for 2 weeks, while paying for some of the rooms for just 2 nights, others for just one, with more payment to follow. Another guest came to the desk and complained twice that his key was mis-programmed and he couldn't get into his room. This guy was very vocal and complained loudly that the hotel needed to get maintenance on-sight to fix the key programming machine and was convincing the people in line in front of me that their keys weren't going to work. The one woman working at the desk was trying to keep her cool but there was NO ONE helping her. She called the manager twice and told him she needed help and she needed someone from maintenance. The manager never showed up but after about 15 minutes some guy who evidently was from maintenance showed up although he did not look like an official maintenance person at all. When I finally got to the front of the line I asked for a first floor, Non-Smoking room b/c I had lots of luggage to bring into the room but none were available. I was assigned to a second floor room to which I went, and luckily the key worked but the room REEKED of smoke AND the toilet wouldn't flush. I went back to the front desk and asked for another room, but those same 2 people who had taken so much time to rent all those rooms for two weeks while I was in line previously WERE BACK and taking another 15 minutes to partially pay for some of the rooms for portions of the 2 weeks. While I waited in line, the woman who had been in front of me initially waiting to check-in came back to request another room too because there were "bugs in the bathroom" of her room. During this return for another room poor Allison was at the front desk STILL and STILL had no help. So when I finally got to the front of the line I told her about the problems with the first room and she assigned me to another, which now magically was on the 1st floor where there were no such rooms available only 20 minutes previously. I went to the newly assigned room, where the toilet flushed, but although there was a non-smoking icon on the door this room also STANK to high-heaven! I had been driving for 7 hours and was exhausted so I unloaded the car figuring that all the rooms must be just as terrible. I then went immediately to CVS for air freshener and neutralizer to make it tolerable. One of the wall lights didn't work; the floor lamp behind the chair was bent and stood at an angle almost propped up by the upholstered chair; the curtains and sheers were stained and torn and not hung regularly on the rod; there was a huge brown smear of something on the wall above the mirror and below some nasty stained ceiling tiles; the wall-mounted iron/ironing board holder was halfway hanging off the wall with one of the screws not present; the ironing board cover was stained; the bathroom had dead bugs on the floor behind the door and tons of cigarette burns on the edge of the tub; there was no drain stopper and looking into the drain I could see hair and string hanging on the cross bars inside the drain; there was only one washcloth; the lightbulb hardware under the shade of one of the bedside lamps was bent so badly that the bulb was touching the shade creating a fire hazard; and the carpet was totally sticky. And that was just the room! The grounds and general appearance of the larger property were equally as abysmal. The entry parking lot was very sketchy, as I mentioned, and the parking lot around back and on the sides of the building was in poor condition; there were cigarette butts all over the parking lot; there were two porch chairs in a parking space in the back as if some people were living there; there was litter everywhere; the laundry room was dark and in disarray, including one washer/dryer that was totally disassembled and askew from the wall; the carpeting in the foyer area outside the laundry room was torn up; the grass in the courtyard around the pool was un-mowed and full of weeds and cigarette butts; the concrete walkways were old and cracked and in one section it looked as if some kind of excavation was taking place with a big pile of concrete pieces piled up; and there was a wooden desk sitting out in the middle of the courtyard in the weeds. There was also a very old, faded piece of kids playground equipment out there but I wouldn't have let any child of mine climb on it. I don't know how this place could be redeemed without a TOTAL makeover. This Ramada was a remarkable dump except for the lobby. And I have pictures if you'd care to see them. I would never stay in this place again. It was so filthy that my travel companion and I were scared to even try out the pool or the restaurant. It was THAT dirty. And instead of parking near my room I parked my car directly under a streetlight in the empty front parking lot which was visible from a major road. I was surprised no one tried to break into it. I am not a fussy person, but this place was HORRIBLE. Avoid at all costs.First, the pros: It's beautiful, it's just a short walk to Epcot from here. That's it. I booked a 3 night stay at the Florida resident rate directly through Disney which gave me a 36% discount off the regular rate. The villas are so costly that this was still an expensive stay even with the discount. I was at the hotel for a total of 7 hours before getting angry enough to check out at 11:30 PM and go to another hotel. First, the parking....the hotel parking lot was designed for one purpose only...to get you to pay an extra $!0 per day on top of the expensive room rate so you don't have to walk quite a distance to the hotel's front entrance. Even the handicapped parking is far from the front entrance. Upon arrival, I pulled up to the valet area where I was ignored so I asked if I could leave my car there until I checked in. A valet took my keys and told me I could do that. At the check-in desk I encounter Cast Member - Raymond who although he's been working at this hotel for a while (as told to me by another Cast Member) knew very little information about it. I asked if I could upgrade to a room with a kitchenette because I hadn't realized until the night before my arrival, that the room I booked onilne only had a microwave and small refrigerator. I was unable to change my reservation online at that point. He told me that they did have a 1 bedroom villa with kitchenette available and after much fuss on the phone to see what the extra fee would be to upgrade, he told me it would be an extra $115 per night. In the few seconds that I was contemplating this, he received a phone call, and then told me he was sorry but he told me the wrong price and that it would be $238 per night to upgrade because they couldn't give me the FL resident discount rate at the hotel. (WHAT??!!) I started to get annoyed at this point and in the few seconds that I was contemplating what to do, another Cast Member came out from behind a closed door, looked at me and said "I'm really sorry but we just sold the only 1 bedroom that was available while you were deciding what to do. NOW I was angry. I said "this is ridiculous, what is going on here? For medical reasons, I need the kitchenette to prepare my own food, I've been here less than an hour and I'm already very aggravated, perhaps I shouldn't stay here at all." A manager that was nearby heard the conversation and whispered something to the Cast Member that came out to tell me the bad news. SUDDENLY....a one bedroom villa with kitchen became available and at the Florida resident discount rate. How about that!!?? Unfortunately this wasn't the end of my misery. I check in and return to the valet area to see about having my luggage taken to my room. A Cast member at the valet booth tells me to "talk to that guy over there" so I do and he walks over to my car with me when I realize I don't have my keys. I go back to the valet booth and they don't know where my keys are. They find them but by then the bellman that was going to help me had walked away from my car. Someone directs me to the bell stand just inside the entrance and I get help with my luggage. I tell the bellman that I'm going to park my car and meet him at my room. This hotel is so large and built in such an odd way that it's difficult to navigate. Raymond gave me the wrong directions on how to get to my room and I quickly became very lost and unable to figure out how to get to where I was supposed to be so I called the front desk from my cell phone. Two cast members came to assist me and they said "this happens all the time here." Hmmmm.....if it happens all the time, don't you think they should do something about that?! Finally both my luggage and I are in the room. I'm exhausted, it took over an hour to complete check in, park my car and find my room. The room is beautiful and very spacious but that's all it is. There is advertising everywhere you look to join the Disney Vacation Club, including on the TV. And I do mean everywhere! The kitchen table had large stickers all over it with these ads and you see them throughout the hotel. I had difficulty finding a TV channel that was NOT advertising something Disney. I went out for a while and when I returned to my room and attempted to use my laptop, I found a sign on the kitchen table that said to look for an ethernet cable in the closet (there was no cable) and that there was a $10 per 24 hours fee to use the service. I was enraged. This was the most expensive hotel I've ever stayed at and they were going to charge me to use the Internet? No they weren't as far as I was concerned. I called the front desk, reported that there was no ethernet cable and that I wished to have the fee for the Internet waived. I was told they "COULDN'T" do that so I asked to be connected to someone who could. I was told that the manager would call me back. About a half hour later, the manager called. He asked me: 1. "Why do you think the Internet should be free?" 2. After explaining that I've stayed at many lesser priced hotels that all had free Internet, usually WiFi, he said "Well if you stay at a Motel 6, they give you free Internet to get you to stay there." I've never stayed at a Motel 6 that was his assumption. After arguing with him for a while and telling him that if he doesn't wave what would amount to $30 for Internet use during my stay, I was checking out immediately and never coming back. His reply was "well, I hate to put you out at 11:30 at night, is there anything else I can do for you? I replied "yes, you can let me use the Internet without charging me. His response was "I'm not WILLING to do that." I quickly found a very lovely Holiday Inn Express on Palm Pkwy. in Lake Buena Vista for $85 per night offering free WiFi, free breakfast, very lovely, clean rooms and helpful management. A few days later while investigating who at Disney I can report my horrible experience to, I found that the Boardwalk Hotel has free WiFi in the lobby and they have a business center. At NO TIME did anyone tell me that.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.I am speachless after the way I was treated by management at the Intercontinental Hotel, Toronto Centre. My reason for my stay was neither for leisure or business; it was an emergency situation that necessitated my stay. I originally booked the room for 5 nights off a discounted hotel booking website. It was an amazing deal in a time when I needed some good luck in my life. I recently had many of my belongings stolen; including all of my personal identification. Upon checking in, I immediately informed the front desk staff of my situation. Considering that I did not have any photo identification, (a requirement to check into most if not all major hotels), my mother accompanied me to check-in. She lives in another city and would not be staying in the room with me, however after staying at the near-by Hilton and Sheraton under similar circumstances, exceptions were made for me because they had her identification on file. The manager on-duty approved my stay and set up a system of me signing my name on a sheet of paper which would be used to verify my identity in event that I needed to replace my room keys or if I extended my stay and needed new keys cut. I did extend my stay - I had no choice and seeing as I had quite a few things in the room (due to my circumstance)... extending was expensive for me but helped ease some stress. I lost my key one late night and had difficulty with a manager on-duty. He could not find my signature, questioned what I told him about my signature identity-verification and told me to wait at my room for security. Security came after a long wait of me sitting in the hall outside of my room, asked me to identify multiple items in the room then let me in. I extended another week - paying the full rate without complaint. Unfortunately, I cam home late from work and lost my key, late at night a week after the first incident. The same manager was on duty. He remembered me but still would not budge in having security accompany to my room. I was able to recide the exact rate I paid for my room each night for the week. He brought up my lack of ID and questioned me on why I didn't have it (which is frankly none of his business, and gave me scripted lines on the hotel's policy on refusing guests with no identification. I was very frustrated and voiced my frustration with the situation - he even admitted to remembering me from the week-prior. The next morning I again intended to extend. I was called by the day's front desk manager who informed me that the hotel would be booked for the night. I knew this to be untrue because I had been monitoring the availability on the hotel's website. When I mentioned this a room suddenly appeared. Then my lack of identification was brought up. I don't understand why this suddenly became an issue, as I had been at the hotel for so long already and we made an agreement upon my check-in. To me - I feel I was treated poorly by the second manager because of my disagreement the previous night... sort of a "getting back at me" type of attitude could be detected. But I was told that a) I could extend and b) I could book online if I chose to for the next night or call in the morning to ensure a room would be free. I went to the lobby to pay for my night and immediately detected a sour attitude from the Manager. She was very very difficult with me. She made it clear to me that she had done me a favour by allowing me to stay. She again lectured me on my ID situation (after telling me on the phone that we could photocopy my one credit card and use that as identification). The way she was speaking to me, questioning me, repeating things that had already been talked about and dealt with - I told her that I found her customer service to be appalling. I am a very easy-going person and customer. I am not a confrontational person nor am I difficult to please... but I had to speak up; her attitude was incredibly catty and disrespectful. After I spoke up she refused to let me pay for the night. I asked for Head Office's number. After a few minutes of back-and-forth bickering at the front desk, in front of other customers, she finally let me pay for the room and after much hesitation, gave me Head office's number. When I tried to renew the room the next day I was told that my reservation could not be extended. I called the Head Office number that I was given the day prior. I told my story to the agent who picked up, only to then realize that the number I was given was not to a "head office"... it was the reservation line of the same hotel! The woman who took my call was very pleasant and passed me onto the hotel manager, Warren. Warren informed me that my stay could not be extended due to my lack of ID. I explained that moving out on such short notice would be extremely difficult and I questioned why it is an issue for me to stay (paying the hotel's full room-rate, ordering room service, generally being a good guest) now when my lack of id was a non-issue when I checked-in. His only reply was that it was a mistake. Well sir.... you made a mistake yet your mistake has caused turmoil for me. After speaking with the "head office" number, I was basically told that the hotel was independently owned and there really is no recourse for me - the hotel management's decision is final. Before these events transpired, I had nothing but good to say about the Intercontinental Hotel. The facilities are very nice, the service was friendly and efficient. But the lack of empathy, catiness, rudeness, and general professionalism by the hotel's management team and total lack of recourse for the hotel's guests upon receiving poor customer service is absolutely appalling.Change your mind: book another one! I usually don't write reviews, as I think each experience is unique and not everything can be rated. But in this case it was all so consistent throughout that I had to. I'll start from the high pointsBeach (4/5) - The best part of the hotel, and what actually saved our holiday. The beach is nice and clean, especially when compared to resorts nearby. They have nice umbrellas and chairs. The beach itself was not great in Punta Cana, but it could be because of the particular season.Pools (4/5) - Nice pools as well. There's plenty of space for everyone. I didn't like too much the Jacuzzi's they had there: air was too strong and not uniform. Rooms (4/5) - Rooms are nice. Furniture is new, the bathroom is very good and spacious. Try to avoid external rooms on the Punta Cana building: there is a construction site which is quite noisy during the day and makes it difficult if you want to rest in your room.Cleaniness (4/5) - Nothing to say about it, if not that a few times they came to make up our bedroom after 6:00 p.m.Bars (2/5) - Nice bar tenders, but drinks are quite bland. One major problem is the fact that most of the staff don't speak English. The only bar with a menu is the Sports Bar. In all the others you have to know in advance what to order: if, like me, you are not expert in drinks, you'll end up ordering the same thing over and over again. Once I tried to ask two bar tenders if they had any coconut-based drink which wasn't a Pina Colada or a Coco Loco. After 10 minutes I gave up and ordered a Pina Colada and a Coco Loco.Food (2/5) - Food quality is just OK. A the buffet, variety is an issue: maybe 90% of the dishes are the same all the time, or just a slight variation of the previous day. Most of the food is not properly labelled, so if you have specific needs (e.g. vegetarian, like my wife) it will be a problem. Pizza is very bad (I'm Italian, I know what pizza should be like). The beach buffet is terrible: fruit is very scarce and they have the same things every day. Trays are open and eaten by insects all the time. Fruit was surprisingly bad everywhere: in the UK you can find much better quality fruit at Asda, and that says it all. A la carte restaurants are a bit better quality.Entertainment (1/5) - Just some fitness and dance lessons on the beach in the morning. In the evening there's literally nothing. Super-boring!Service (0/5) - The worst experience of my life in a hotel. The only good guy we found was a waiter who helped us with my wife's dietary needs in one of the restaurants. Other than that, I'll just mention the main things. When you land in the Dominican Republic they will start filling you head up with this story that a dominican minute lasts 120 seconds, which would have been great if it was true. They say don't rush, you're on holiday! That's correct, we are on holiday, others are supposed to work. Even tips don't make things faster.Our check in took one hour. We urged them to deliver our suitcases immediately, since we had been travelling for 20 hours and we needed a shower. After 40 minutes the luggage was not yet there: we rushed back to the reception and found our suitcases lying out of the entrance, nobody attending them. We picked them up and carried them ourselves. Our room was on the cunstruction side. We asked to change room, and that operation took another 1.5 hours. The situation again was solved by my wife who picked up the new keys at the reception, after the guys told us we have sent them half an hour earlier.Reception only gives you a map of the hotel and a poor-quality photocopy (text only) with a list of bar/restaurants and main activities. There's nothing in the rooms (no brochures, cost guidelines, etc...). Dressing code is a question mark: people walk in bath suit by the reception (where there is a reminder to dress properly) while we were almost kicked out from the Sports Bar for the same reason (no indication whatsoever about dressing code there).Most of the times at the buffet we would end our meal without getting any drinks: waiters are too slow, and sometimes they just don't come to your table. Again, tips don't help.A la carte restaurants are terrible: half of the tables are empty and there are 20 people queuing up out of the door for 40 minutes after their booked time. In the italian restaurant we waited 45 minutes before getting a starter (some simple salad).The best of the best happened the last day. We asked for a late checkout at 2:00 p.m.. Again, we had to go to the reception 3 times to understand how to do it. They eventually told us to go there at 7 (!!) in the same morning we were leaving. Of course when we got there they told us it was the wrong time and we should have come later. Anyway, we finally managed to convince them, and they kept a complimentary 5 dollars tip without asking. We pretended not to see. At 1:00 p.m. (one hour before the check-out) we made our way towards our room, only to find it locked! Our stuff still inside, we still needed to prepare everything! And, of course, we were absolutely certain that we needed a lot of time to solve the situation. And in fact I had to run twice to the reception to try and get new keys (which weren't working). By the way, the reception was maybe 300 meters away from our room! We called each and everyone and they just didn't seem to bother. I had already decided to knock the door down when a man showed up and opened it up for us by tweaking the electronic lock. 45 minutes, just 15 minutes away from the checkout!These are just the few things worth mentioning in a weeks stay. Basically everyday we had issue after issue with the reception or the service in general.Overall I have to rate the hotel with the lowest score, even though it does not reflect the average of the other scores: service is always the first thing in a hotel.Change your mind if you're thinking to book this hotel!How can hope to stay in business with service like this?Three weeks ago my family went to Saratoga Springs for vacation. We travelled with two small children a 2 year old and a 4 year old. We took advantage of the Disney Magical Express as a means of transporting us from the airport to the resort. We had 5 carry on bags that the driver of the bus took from us and put under the bottom of the bus. When we got to the hotel, I was strapping my youngest son in the stroller while my Mom was tending to my 4 year olds and maneuvering the bags. The driver dropped our bags and took off. By the time I turned around and noticed that two of my bags were not there the driver had already took off. I immediately notified the bellhop and the front desk when I checked it. I provided a description of the driver and our bags. This was 11 p.m. at night. I was given a claims number and told that at the end of the night the driver would return any bags left on the bus to lost and found. I was given a claims number to follow-up. When we reached the room I called and they had no updates. I then called again at 1 a.m. and still no updates. I was then told that I had to wait until the bags show up. One bag contained all our toiletries, diapers prescription medicines etc. The other bag contained our camcorder, digital camera my sons Nintendo DS etc. so I was very concerned that not much seem to happening in recovering my bags quickly. The next day I called numerous times and was given the same answer--no updates. I kept insisting that they need to find the driver and I was told that there is no tracking system to determine which bus they put me on and since I don't know the driver's name it would be difficult for them to figure out. At this point I went to the Saratoga Springs Concierge to speak to a manager to see if they could help me. During my discussions, I was informed that Disney Express is not a "Disney" Company and that I would have to work with Meers Transportation who owns and operates the Disney Express. Keep in mind that these were the same individuals who were not very helpful to begin with. I was told that they would search all the Disney properties to see if the bags show up as a first attack in handling the problem. I kept insisting why they are not looking for the driver of the bus and I repeatedly provided a description of the driver, detail information about the time we got on the bus and the stops the driver made and still no update on the driver. What should have been an exciting vacation and especially for my 4 year old because it was his first trip to Disney, turned into time spent talking on the phone repeatedly, following up with Meers and the Saratoga staff about my lost luggage with no new information on a daily basis. I arrived on a Saturday and it was not until Tuesday did I receive a phone call from someone at Meers transportation about my bag. I was called because my issue was turned over to Meers Claims Department. The gentleman I spoke with expressed surprised that the driver was not located and I again reiterated the same information that I told numerous times before. I provided him with a list of the items I had in the bag and he questioned me as to why I allowed the driver to put my bag under the bottom of the bus if I had so much valuables in there and why I didn't take it with me on the bus if I could take it as a carryon on the plane. I explained that the driver told me to put the bags under the bus so I did. The value of the stuff in both my bags was about $3,500. I did not hear from the claims department on Wednesday as I was told so Thursday afternoon I called and left a message that I was concerned since I was leaving the next day and no one called me back. I received a call back informing me that this is shared liability since I left my bag on the bus. I was also informed that the driver was located and he told them that all the bags that got on the bus got off the bus. I was also told that the driver is a veteran of the company and for all they know those bags did not get on the bus in the first place. I was horrified to be spoken to in such a manner. The claims agent went on to tell me that what they can do is provide me with $250 per bag for a total of $500 and that that amount should be enough for me to cover the deductible on my home owner's insurance. I informed him that that was unacceptable for the value of the things that I had in the bag and I was told and I quote, "I don't know what to tell you, you might want to get a lawyer." I was stunned for the utter disregard for my personal property. I have already loss because the pictures of my children and my family on our camera will never be replaced but to be spoken to in such a manner was appalling. I asked to speak to a supervisor and I was told that a supervisor was not available. I reported the incident to the manager on duty at the time at Saratoga Springs and I was told they would follow-up because they received a voicemail for the claims agent. Interestingly, on my return ride to the airport, I refused to put my bag under the bus and had a confrontation with the driver who informed me that I am required to put my bag under the bus because if the bags shift and hit a passenger they are liable and he could loose his job...Oh the irony because I was berated for putting my valuables under the bus by the claims agent on the one hand and told by the driver on the other hand that it is a requirement. Today is exactly two weeks since I left the Saratoga Springs hotel and I have not heard anything from anyone at Meers Transportation. Since I had recently bought into Disney vacation club, I contacted them to see if and what they can do to assist me in helping to resolve the situation. I am still waiting and I am no closer to finding out what is happening to provide compensation for my property. Needless to say, this was not an ideal vacation because of this situation. While the Saratoga Springs property is nice, I believe the staff did not handle the situation properly in helping me resolve things. I was at the mercy of whoever was the manager on duty at the time that I go to the front desk to inquire. The staff did do two things for me, we received a $50 credit on our account to help purchase necessities such as toothbrush etc in the gift shop/grocery store onsite and I was given a ride to Wal-Mart to buy some replacement for things that were lost that we needed on the trip. Disney "sells" the magic of what they have to offer. However, in the event that things go wrong an individual is at their own mercy. Especially in tough economic times such as these, families are making sacrifices to continue to take vacations when we do so, we expect certain standards to be met and unfortunately the Saratoga Springs (Disney) did not live up to those standards. My recommendation is to find your own means of transportation from the hotel and should you decide to stay on a Disney property be mindful that if things go wrong you could be on your own.I came to fresh expecting a great meal, and all I got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we couldn't enjoy eating.This is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business!Don't be tempted by the price-- go elsewhere. I was really hesitant to book this trip because of some of the reviews I read here and now I definitely wish I鈥檇 listened to my instinct. As soon as I arrived at the VIK Arena Blanca (formerly the LTI), I knew I was in for it. A number of rooms were under construction and yet the staff was trying to place guests in rooms that had no electricity nor air conditioning. In other rooms, the lights wouldn鈥檛 turn off at all. Guests had to literally fight with reception to be moved to another room, while others just suffered. Because of this situation, they had more guests than nice, functioning rooms. Which meant that when I arrived, a 24 year old female all by myself, I guess the receptionists saw me as someone who would be easy to cheat out of the oceanview room I paid for, and to put me in a small ground floor non-ocean view room right next to the construction. And it took a lot of arguing on my part (I have some fight in me) and a lot of rudeness on the part of the receptionist in order to get the room that I paid for. And even then, to call it an oceanview room would be stretching it. More like ocean-peek. It could sort of see a bit of a white cap now and then when the wind blew the trees a certain way... and if I held a seashell to my ear, yeah, I could hear the ocean... except between 8:45 and about 11:15 every night, during which I couldn鈥檛 even hear myself think because the music from the entertainment was pounding through my room while I was trying to write. Or, you know, relax... 鈥榗ause I was on vacation. What was worse was that they played the same annoying songs every night, which by night 6 was driving me absolutely out of my mind. What was also disappointing about the room was my 鈥渒ing鈥?bed... not a king at all, in fact, but rather two ancient (antique?) twin beds pushed together, with two twin comforters for each, and two separate sheet sets. Except the sheet sets didn鈥檛 have a fitted sheet 鈥?they just had a flat sheet wrapped and tucked under the mattress. So if you toss and turn a little (and believe me, you will, the beds are so uncomfortable), you dislodge the flat sheet and wake up on a bare, nasty, dirty, ancient twin mattress. So, 4 stars? Yeah, right. Aside from that, the room was clean and the complimentary minibar came in handy. The cleaning staff was warm, but I only had them come every two days. But when they did come, they often had to come in two trips which was slightly inconvenient because you get undressed to take a shower and realize that you have no towels. You find the maid and ask for more and she says they ran out, but someone will drop by later to bring you more. In the meantime, if you had plans to get ready for a nice dinner and wash the chlorine or sand off of you 鈥?forget it. You have to go to dinner as you are. But with clothes on.Speaking of dinner: oh my [--] goodness. The food was horrendous. The food was always either undercooked or dried out altogether. Good luck finding any pork in the battered and fried pork chops. The scrambled eggs a mound of runny wet yellow grossness. For the salad bar: I hope you like flavourless olive oil or thousand islands dressing. Or ketchup. And Kraft Singles. And watery tuna-salad-something-or-other. You will spend a good part of your evening just waiting for the food-poisoning to kick in. That said, I never ventured into the a-la-carte restaurants because I was alone (and I find that awkward because waiters always want to know where your boyfriend is). But speaking of waiters鈥攖hey were excellent. They were warm, friendly and attentive. They were quick to refill your watered-down frothy wine or your Cola light which 鈥?even virgin 鈥?always tasted like it had a little rum something in it. All the fountain sodas taste a little rummy. But when you dare to go to the mini-market to pick up two small Diet Cokes and a small thing of chocolate (because you鈥檙e starving, after all) 鈥?be prepared to pay $18 USD for it. We had a few days of rain 鈥?which, naturally, I don鈥檛 blame on the VIK 鈥?but when that happens, that鈥檚 when a hotel鈥檚 4 starts should still make your visit enjoyable. Your room should be comfortable, your cable television should work rather than having no volume on some channels, or a Direct TV icon floating around on a black screen. The internet should work. When it doesn鈥檛, you should at least be refunded for the minutes you wasted getting 鈥渃annot find server鈥?and not being able to log out of your account, with the minutes still going, going, gone. The food should be, if not always piping hot or even totally flavourful, edible and not frightening. When the resort invites a group of vendors to set up stands outside the restaurant, the men working there should not persistently ask you if you鈥檝e ever been with a black man, nor try to persuade you to ditch your boyfriend (I lied and said he was sick and in our room) to let him show you how much better he can 鈥済ive it to you鈥? However, on the sunny days, the beautiful and immaculately kept resort grounds helped compensate for some of the VIK鈥檚 shortcomings, and the beach was unlike any other I鈥檝e seen.Would I recommend the VIK? Absolutely not. Passengers I flew with had a much better time at the Bavaro Princess and... another resort with Princess in the name. Book it at your own risk. If you do go: bring your Gravol, your portable DVD player, some Myoflex (for your aching back and neck in the morning), a poster of the ocean to put on your wall, and your pepper spray. Enjoy.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.I just got back from a vegas vacation and stayed at MGM and Mandalay Bay gambling roughly $10,000 of total "action" with bets ranging from $75 to $1000 per roll in craps and $50 to $500 in Baccarat. One great streak in craps at Mandalay Bay made me $2,500 from $200. I'm no stranger to vegas and have stayed and gambled in many strip hotels, the only reason I gave mandalay a try was for a party with friends. The hotel was very nice we had a parlor suite that has 2 seperate bedrooms and a large living area. Mini bars are a thing of the past in vegas and when I asked my bellman why my fridge was empty(and barely cold) he said that I should get the casino host to "comp" me to have it filled or I could pay to have it filled but quote, "That would cost way too much". Even the non-suites do not have mini bars. So the big catch 22 is that it's my first time in Mandalay and the casino does not care how big a gambler you are at other casinos, I was told they have a "show me the money" attitude. So I thought to myself, OK fine, I'll just charge everything to the room and see what they can do for me when I check out. After checking in I went and registered for the all important Players Card that allows pit bosses to track your play and then comp you accordingly. I was surprised to see that this same players card works in slot machines as well(not a big slots fan but good to see that the card works there as well). So I walk up to the craps pit and cash $1,000 ans start playing $15 pass with come and full odds(3,4,5). In minutes I have $100-$300 riding on the rolls. I played every day for hours over my 5 day stay and always gave my players card to the pit bosses before I played so I knew I was being tracked. Played a bit of a baccarat as well(about 4 hours total) but craps was my main game with well over 10hours of play time during my stay. Not trusting the "charge to your room and we will comp you based on your play system" I wisely asked the pit boss for a comp after one of my playing sessions, he gave me one for the buffet for 4 people valued at $96. This must be on top of my other comps(I'm thinking). As far as the Hotel, it is very nice but everything is over priced, even the famous WOLFGANG PUCK lasagna at the "high end" italian restaurant was bland and disappointing for its $20 Price tag. Also you cant get a drink with peace and quiet. You either have to gamble and drink, or sit down at one of the many 'lounges' on the casino floor and be prepared to yell and scream to your party because the live bands are so loud they want everyone to cut the small talk, and just drink and dance and party. This is fine but I was hoping for the option of at least sitting down and having a drink with friends and actually talking with them. SO NOW I CHECKOUT: At front desk and I give them my players card. They tell me that I must take my bill and my card to the "players club" and they will write some off for me. So fine I go to the Players club counter in the center of the casino where I was told to go, but these people can only comp slot related play so I'm sent to the real Players club elsewhere in the casion, all the while my party waiting outside with my luggage. As I enter this "Players Lounge" I see another disgruntled player in front of me debating with the "Casino Host" over thousands of dollars spent with no comps, I already get worried but not letting it phase me, I walk up to the "Host" and show them my checkout bill and my players card and ask what they can do for me. They look me up and say that I've been rated as a $70 per hour player. I calmly expalin to the host that I have gambled with over $10k bankroll in craps and my bets where often in the 100-300 range with some rolls having $500 per roll. At the least they under rated me by 3x. I was then told that the ODDS portion of the bets in craps does not get rated anymore(as of last week,, gee thanks), but even then my pass line and come bets were totalling well over $100. Before I debate this issue I simply ask, "Ok well what can you do for me?". And I'm told QUOTE , "First of all sir, Mandalay Bay is the hardest hotel on the strip to get comps, I see that you had a buffet comp for 4 with $25 credit still available, but at this time I'm unable to offer you any discount to your bill". In complete shock I calmly inform the host that this kind of play at the Aladdin would get me everything comp'd. She shrugs her shoulders and sends me to talk to the pit bosses about being rated too low and also advises me that for the "future" I should ASK every single pit boss that rates me what I got rated at before I leave the table(what fun). She also mentioned that I should refrain from moving craps tables as they find it hard to keep track of me in their huge craps pit of 8 tables.(I gave my players card to every pit boss at every new table I moved too and I always stayed more then 30 minutes per table). In the end they credited my $2.56 on my $3,000 bill and were not even willing to apply my $25 buffet credit to my bill. WARNING to any gamblers looking for comps: MB is the WORST place to gamble at and unless you plan on gambling $50K and fighting for a $3k bill to be cleared I would steer clear. I am NEVER gambling at this casino again and think its a DISGRACE that this casino is not more competitive. I will be mailing the Customer Relations people and speaking to managment about this negative experience. And for those that say, "At least you get free drinks". I say: Great but 8/10 waitresses dont know what a vodka paralyzer is and all the beer is luke warm. DO NOT GAMBLE AT THIS CASINO.On January 27, 2006, my husband, 6-year old son and myself set off to Indianapolis to fly to Orlando, Florida on vacation. Because our flight was leaving at 8AM on January 28th, we decided to stay the night at a hotel near the airport and do "Park & Fly" for the week that we were gone. I had called on January 26th to make a reservation at Days Inn for the following night. At the time I asked about the Park & Fly rate and was told that they offered 7 nights free parking with one nights stay. I was given a total of $96.43 (including taxes and fees) for one non-smoking room with two double beds, two adults and one child, and were guaranteed late arrival. We arrived at Days Inn at 11PM on January 27, 2006. My son was asleep in the back seat, so I went in alone to check-in and my husband stayed in the van. When I gave the clerk at the desk my name, he said that they didn't have a reservation for me. I gave him the confirmation number and he said that they had me in the system for the 26th, not the 27th. I told him that there was a mistake on their part and asked if they had a room for us that night. The clerk said they did but he would have to charge me an additional $25 to leave our vehicle there for 7 nights. I asked about the free parking with one nights stay, and he said that we weren't booked with the Park & Fly rate. The Park & Fly rate evidently costs more, so in the end the parking really isn't free. Because it was so late and we were all so tired, I didn't really have a choice. So I paid the additional money and finished checking in. When I went back out to the van to unload our luggage and get the rest of my family, I found my husband standing outside of our van with an upset look on his face. He said that while I was inside, a Days Inn shuttle bus had hit our van with my husband and son IN it. The driver's name was Mary and she didn't seem to be bothered with what had just happened. She said that she tried to squeeze between our van and the curb, but there just wasn't enough room. My first concern was that my husband and son were okay. They were shaken up but seemed unharmed. I then looked at the incredible damage down the side of my van, and then went back in to talk to the front desk. By now the man that had been helping me was gone and a lady was there. I told her what happened and she got on the phone and called he General Manager, Dennis Anderson, at home. He said that all of the insurance information was locked in his office and no one else had a key. I asked why the insurance information was not in the shuttle bus, but he had no answer. He said that he would get me a copy of everything in the morning. I told him that we were leaving at 6AM the next morning to catch our flight, and asked if he would be in that early. He said no, but he would make a copy of everything for me and leave it at the front desk for me to pick-up when we got back on February 3. I said okay, but that I was going to call the police so that there would be a report on file. The girl at the desk told me that calling the police wasn't really necessary. I stood my ground and told her that at the very least, my insurance company would want a police report. So she called 911 and asked for a Sheriff to come out. The Sheriff got there within 30 minutes and took a report. I overheard Mary, the bus driver, telling him that she didn't do the damage to the front of my van - only the damage to the back. I immediately jumped in and asked her how on earth she believed that she didn't do ALL of the damage? She said she didn't know, but just knew that she didn't do it all. I'm not sure if she was saying that because she was scared of losing her job, or what. So, I decided that arguing with her was pointless and went back in to speak with the lady at the front desk to order a wake-up call for 5AM the next day. I mentioned to her that it would be very hospitable for the hotel to comp part if not all of our room cost, since the accident had caused us a LOT of inconvenience. She told me that she was already working on it with her manager, and that she felt bad about what happened. The next morning I went to the front desk, and the same lady told me that her Manager told her that we could take it up any comps with their insurance company. If they think we deserve anything extra we can get it from them. ?!?!? My mouth dropped open and I told her that I was blown away by that comment. I didn't have time to say much else because we had to leave for the airport. When we got back on February 3rd, it was again late at night. The same lady was at the front desk that was there when we checked in. I asked her for the envelope that was supposed to be left with me with their insurance company information enclosed. She said that Dennis must have forgotten to leave it because there wasn't anything there for me. She called him again at home, and he told her to tell me that the insurance company is Fireman's Fund, and gave me the toll free number. He told her to tell me that he would call us at home the next day with more detailed information. At that point I asked her what Mr. Anderson's boss's name is because I was going report this whole situation to the Days Inn Corporate Office and to his superior. The lady at the desk then told me that Mr. Anderson doesn't really have a superior for me to contact. I then told her that at the very least I would be contacting the Days Inn Corporate office with my complaint. Today is February 15, 2006, and my van is still not fixed. I have been communicating with Fireman's Fund Insurance since we got back, and they are disputing that their driver caused all of the damage. An investigation is under way and I should hopefully have resolution by tomorrow at the latest. I guarantee that if ALL of the damage done to my van by the shuttle bus doesn't get repaired, I will turn everything over to my attorney and we can take this to court. This has got to me the most blatant example of awful customer service that I have ever experienced in my life! My husband and I travel quite a bit and have always trusted Days Inn as a quality place to stay. Now I have serious doubts about ever using Days Inn again. I know for sure that I will never again use the Indianapolis location.The trip from hell Dates of travel : 1/30/07 - 2/6/07Resort: Barcelo Bavaro Golf and Casino Resort My mother and I have not been to DR, our country of birth, for many years. In many ways, this trip was supposed to help us fondly reminisce about our native land and also help my mother psychologically and emotionally heal from several years of multiple medical crises. You see, my mother is 83 years old and is a cervical and uterine cancer and stroke survivor. This trip meant so many things for us and now all we have to remember of this trip is the complete fiasco and horrible experience at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach hotel I had made a reservation at the CASINO hotel, which is one of the five hotels in the resort. Even before we pulled up to the hotel, the van driver told me to verify at the front desk if I had actually made the reservation in the right hotel. Why would he even question this? I was immediately suspicious. Sure enough, when I went to check in, I was told that I was 鈥渦pgraded鈥?to the BEACH hotel. When I asked to remain in the Casino hotel, I was then told the real side of the story. They had in fact overbooked and a room was not available to us. This was a classic tale of 鈥渂ait and switch.鈥?As we were heading to the Beach hotel, the van driver told me that it was customary for guests to be 鈥渦pgraded.鈥?Once we got to the Beach hotel, I was very clear and angry that we were in fact downgraded. The Beach hotel was nothing like the Casino hotel. It also made me realize that when I researched this resort, all hotels were described similarly but in reality, every hotel was distinct. This was a prime example of false advertising When we finally got to the Beach hotel鈥檚 front desk, I became even more anxious when I saw a group of angry guests who had already been waiting to get their rooms for the past hour. And sure enough, as I tried to check in, I was told that it would be at least an hour to get into our room. After two hours of waiting, I asked to speak with a supervisor or a manager (and by the way, the guests that were there before me were still in the lobby, just even angrier), but the front desk staff had the audacity to state that there was no supervisor. Then the front desk staff hid in a separate room to avoid further complaints and angry glares from all of the awaiting, tired, sweaty, hungry, and angry guests. Finally, all guests were eventually told that their rooms were available at the same time. Hmmm, did the cleaning personnel magically and simultaneously prepare all rooms? Why did all of us have to wait in the lobby at the same time? It just didn鈥檛 make any sense. When we got to our room, we were greeted by the lovely sounds of the toilet flushing鈥?in the next room. Well, we hoped that our experience at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach resort would get better. Surely, things couldn鈥檛 get any worse. Could they? As a matter of fact, they surely did. For example, when one thinks of Dominican food, mouths usually water. How can Dominican food ever, ever taste bad? Well, it apparently can. When we arrived to our first meal, the Mexican buffet, the presentation of the food was not as enticing as compared to other resorts I鈥檝e been to. Was this even Mexican? What was it? My mother chose the fish and she ended up getting sick right away. She spent her first night, of a long awaited vacation, vomiting and experiencing diarrhea. And by the way, the subsequent meals did not fair any better. The Italian restaurant was a disaster鈥?I had to spit out a biteful of shrimp (was it even shrimp?). I was hungry that night, and a few nights after that. After a few days of going hungry and scared of eating anything, my mother鈥檚 legs began to swell up. I went to the public relations office and asked for a wheelchair. She told me that there was only one wheelchair on the premises and it was already out on loan. She directed me to the doctor鈥檚 office and he had the nerve to ask me for $400 American dollars as a deposit and $10 American dollars daily for use of the wheelchair. Since I couldn鈥檛 get the wheelchair, my mother and I were restricted from getting around the resort in search of and hope of finding some edible food. I also hoped that the entertainment options would somehow help me forget that I was hungry. But, this got me even more upset and at times bored. The disco 鈥淒J鈥?was very talented. He played the same music in the same sequence every single night. It didn鈥檛 matter which night I went to the disco, it was the same music, same sequence, same nonsense. What entertainment! But, I was excited about the fact that there was a burger joint next to the club. But wait, it closes at 3am when the disco closes at 6am. I鈥檓 sorry for sounding so negative. I did meet some lovely tourists from Canada and Switzerland. There鈥檚 nothing better to help guests bond than a common suffering. We were all hungry and disappointed. I was even sad to hear that many of my new friends claimed that they would never go back to DR. DR is beautiful (the beach by the Barcelo Beach resort was no exception) and other resorts that I鈥檝e visited have been perfect. No complaints whatsoever. Honestly, I was trying to search for the positives. Anything, anything at all. I had hoped that the staff would somehow make up for what was lacking in the resort. Yet, they too were a big disappointment. The restaurant staff were not friendly at all. One pregnant staff member had an extremely bad attitude. She ignored my greeting and when I had to ask a question, she responded with a blank stare. And remember, I speak Spanish. There was no language barrier and thus no excuse for staff to pretend to not understand what I was saying or asking. I also saw some of the same employees work during all shifts. One woman served me breakfast, lunch, and dinner, AND served me drinks at the disco until 5am. These employees are overworked and it is no wonder they are not the friendliest. Also, I left some money for the maid as a tip to service my room, but the money was taken but the beds were not made. One afternoon, I returned to the room shower following a morning on the beach, and found that the room was not serviced. The room was finally cleaned at 5pm.And another comment about false advertising鈥?why were drinks not included during one of the entertainment shows (鈥淭ropicalism鈥?. What an embarrassment when I was given a bill but my wallet was in the room. Who carries a wallet in an all-inclusive resort?So, we get to our fond farewells鈥?I called for the bellhop to assist with my bags and the operator could not locate a bellhop. What? What do you mean you can鈥檛 find the bellhop? Do you only have one for the entire resort? Long story short, I took my bags down and the bellhop was nice to make his appearance when I had already done all the work. Nice鈥?I cannot believe so many people give this hotel a good review, I am a travel agent and have stayed in some good hotels, and some amazing hotels, perks of the job which I'm very grateful for and couldn't afford out of my own pocket, but when it comes out of my own pocket I have also stayed at many cheap basic hotels, this is by far the worst ever, location is great yes, but there are many hotels in Amsterdam with equal and better locations, which are so much better value for money, at the time I went, although I booked well in advance I couldn't get any travel industry rates anywhere, just my luck, and my companions wanted to stick to a tight budget so the cheapest we found was the Atlanta, but for what we paid, 87 euros a night, well that was a rip off.....we entered the hotel, had to wait in line at the 2 foot long check in desk while a man was complaining that his room didn't have a toilet or shower in it, they were in the corridor he had now being told, I sniggered behind his back thinking poor man, I'm glad we don't have to suffer that, until I discovered we did have to suffer that... apparently if u read the small print there is a basic room, shower/toilet in corridor, and a standard room, shower/toilet in room, the man made me laugh when he said even in Uganda they have showers in hotel rooms, I've never been there but u get the point, I guess maybe hostels may not have showers/toilets in rooms either, but the Atlanta calls itself a hotel, and based in a major city you'd expect basic facilities such as that in the room as standard, so we check in an they only had 1 room booked, when Id booked 2, no computer to check this on, just a notepad, they eventually said ok well we have another room spare anyway, u then have to pay upfront, when most hotels allow u to pay on departure if u have not already prepaid, they obviously trust noone, then again if I was the check in staff there I wouldnt trust anyone to pay at the end of their stay after experiencing a night in the Atlanta hotel, our rooms were not ready as we checked in early so we were invited to leave our bags in an open kitchen, full of other bags around a table with slices of ham and cheese on, no chef, right I thought, not eating here, no matter how bad munchies I get, it also didn't feel too safe leaving our bags amongst others in this un-supervised room, we left and went out for a bit, came back, checked in, no lift as its a small hotel, up 4 flights of very steep stairs with bags, which is quite tiring when its the 1st time uv been in a hotel with no lift, get to our room, luxury...not, beds on wheels on wooden floor, my cousin stands on bed to look out of tiny window bout 1 foot by 1 foot, bed goes flyin backwards, he goes flat on his face on floor, word of advice: make sure u have insurance if u stay in this hotel, also when u toss an turn in night, or whatever else u may get upto ;) the bed moves with u, the lady at checkin told us although the toilet/shower was in corridor, the room had full wash facilities, this was a very small sink with no plug hole, u can't use it for washing or shaving as u cant fill the sink, so u have to leave the tap running and put ur face down there to splash ur face as required, as u do this u hit ur head on the glass shelf above, which due to the small size of the sink means u cant do more than cup some water in ur hands, bring ur hands out of the sink, throw it over ur face, and then it ends up on the floor, the safe in our room was locked and wouldnt open, the safe in our cousins room was open but wouldnt lock, no box of tissues in the room either, which is pretty standard elsewhere, and u do miss em when u dont have em an have to go to the corridor toilet to get some cheap an nasty toilet roll, onto the toilet review, the toilet room is about the size of a small wardrobe, once ur in u cant move backwards or forwards, they ran out of toilet roll 1 day, it wasnt replaced when we left the next day, we had to find another toilet on another floor and take theirs, onto the shower, again a tiny sink, and a shower head, not attached to the wall, it hangs on a metal clip spraying back against the wall, so u have to take it off and hold it above ur head, and put it down to get shampoo/shower gel, then pick it up again, very annoying, til on the day before we checked out, our mate Reggie from Pittsburgh, who we met on the trip an laughed together bout the hotel, he had a roll of masking tape with him (Don't ask why, maybe he was planning on kidnapping somebody), anyway, he used this masking tape and taped the shower to the wall so that u didnt have to hold it yourself, genius, even tho it looked awful, but then again so did everything else, make sure u read the sign on the back of the door, if u check out upto half an hour late u get charged 50% of an extra nights stay, if you check out later than that u get charged a full extra nights stay, I have never experienced that anywhere, we made sure we were out an hour before check out just to be sure, oh and our rooms werent cleaned once during our 4 nt stay, and no new towels, thats about it, I think iv covered all the bad points, onto the good points.....no sorry can't think of any apart from the location, there are other hotels in Amsterdam, a hell of a lot, that are around the same price, maybe a bit more, maybe cheaper, but are so much better than this joke of a hotel, I have read reviews of people who stayed here in the "honeymoon" suite, with a jacuzzi, sounds good but after staying there I can't imagine it being anything special, certainly not somethin Id stay with my new wife in, I think id be divorced as soon as I returned to the UK, and slagged off for taking my new wife to the worst hotel in the world for our honeymoon, anyone who has done this, how could u...I feel sorry for your wife, DO NOT STAY HERE, EVER! Unless they pay u to, and pay u a hell of a lot of money.This would be the most TERRIBLE experience I have ever had in my life...and I am a worldly traveller having stayed in the most budget of budget hostels! This review on BELVEDERE HOTEL (EURO HOTEL CLAPHAM) is long but that is how bad it was - definitely worth the read...especially on the TICS / BED BUGS!! I'm a local in Clapham however I needed a room for 3nights as my partner was flying in from Italy and unfortunately I only rent a small single room. Hence I explained this with the hotel staff saying I was looking for a local hotel to do a regular monthly booking - this obviously didn't seem to have any impact on them! Firstly when we arrived we had to pay for all 3nights upfront which I did feel a bit uncomfortable with however I assumed it would be ok. Big mistake! The room was very basic - however we expected that. But never did we expect to compromise our health! The bathroom was incredibly small and Iâ€™m amazed they fit a toilet in that space. The door needed to be left open. We decided to have showers but quickly discovered that there was no hot water. So eventually the staff advised that there were no other rooms available and that we would need to use the shower in a different single room on our floor whilst we stayed there! Then once coming home from dinner at 1.00am I was in bed and whilst my partner was preparing to get into bed he noticed something crawling on the pillow. We lifted up the pillow and a plague of TICS / BED BUGS came rushing out. It was the most disgusting sight I had ever seen and I was almost physically sick - not to mention that we were scratching ourselves and checking each others head for TICS that may have got in there! We asked hotel staff to come to the room immediately and in the interim I took photos. The man apologised and said I would be able to get a refund for that night. I informed him that we would not be staying in THAT room and unfortunately at 1.30am in the morning there aren't too many options as to where you can go - and also I already knew that hotels in that area were completely booked out for the weekend. Mysteriously a room became available at 2am in the morning (remembering that earlier when our shower wasn't working they said there were completely booked out!). So we had to pack up all our suitcases and get dressed and move to another floor at 2am in the morning! Needless to say after changing rooms we did not sleep at all as the sensation of the TICS/BED BUGS crawling on our faces was too vivid! Then in the morning we heard loud sounds of water dripping in our bathroom. I investigated the sound and was shocked to find the bathroom floor full of puddles as there was water leaking from the room above and coming through our ceiling! In the morning when I went downstairs to discuss this horrible experience and to organise the refund that I had been promised the night before - I was informed by the new day staff that due to the fact that another room was provided to us they had decided to not provide us with our promised refund for the first night stay! I asked to speak to the manager however he told me that the manager did not have time to speak to me! Unfortunately we had no where else to go and as stated I had already paid in full for the 3nights. So I really had no options and they played on that. I cannot believe that in 2007 a consumer does not have any rights and that this inefficiently run establishment believed they could set their own rules in London and they did! They did not care that I stated I would take this further and that I had taken photos of the TICs / BED BUGS as well as have witnesses. Actually he laughed at me and invited me to take it further - he was incredibly disrespectful. After the 3rd day of requesting to speak to the manager - and receiving the same response that the manager was too busy to speak to me - he informed me that he could provide me with a pathetic 25pound refund and that would be it! Needless to say we stayed outside of the hotel for the remaining time and only went there to sleep for a minimal 6hrs and we ensured that we laid down towels on the bed first to sleep on. The worst experience of my life - but more so from a point of view of being robbed of your consumer rights and realising that you had no power to do anything because THEY had set their own rules - and you were insignificant because they had already received your money! I have never been one to read reviews as I never really understood their purpose - but now I do! Also for the fact of paying an extra 10pounds a night in another hotel it really is worth it! Please do consider this review strongly as it is not worth taking the risk - as Iâ€™m assuming the room with TICs/BED BUGS was rented out the next night - as I cant imagine a new mattress/pillows being bought!!Hotel Center? The blurb for this hotel on many other sites is nothing but lies. Claims made in disjointed english about it being just 'steps' from the Collosseum are hilarious, provided one doesn't have to actually stay in this hotel. At present, metro station Manzoni is closed for emergency repairs. This means a trek of about 10 minutes just to get to another out of the way metro station (Vittorio Emmanuele II), that you absolutely do need to use to get in to town (just do not try to walk it, like you would be led to believe you can.) Termini, far from being 5 minutes walk away, is a good 20, and 30 if one is leaden down with baggage. This is not conducive to anything other than a pack mule experience. What's worse is that for a newbie to Rome - which my family and I were - one cannot understate the failed multicultural experiment that the Esquiline area is. Under no circumstances stay here. The place is a haven for unsavoury characters. To list a few incidents; there were the usual drunken gangs of youths, who were vandalising the Vittorio Emmanuele metro station when we walked past them. Then there were the beggars and gypsy families rummaging through rubbish bins, the mentally ill pushing trolleys around and muttering indecipherable jibberish to themselves, people drinking on the street, those with visible venereal diseases and lesions, and there was even the ubiquitous old man and his dog that gets better care than he can afford to give to himself. What can one say, this neighbourhood could be compared to the Harlem of New York. Perhaps not quite as severe purely from a law and order perspective, but certainly traversing the dimly lit, graffiti filled, rubbish lined streets of this neighbourhood, one doesn't feel at all safe. Indeed, one has to buzz the reception from the outside of the hotel before one is let in. The breakfast? They call it continental, I call it stingy. In the hotel's 'breakfast room', maintained by dishevelled cleaning staff that are clearly bussed in from an agency, there are 2 drinks machines. One dispenses 'orange juice' and 'pineapple juice'. However, it really is the luck of the draw which one you get, as they seem to pay no heed to the labels on the front of the machine. I got a glass of pineapple juice that was utterly repulsive, that went down about as well as gut rot. Both juices (when I eventually got orange juice) were watered down heavily, and that's probably just as well, as the concentrated juice could probably induce real gut rot. The other machine dispenses equally vile coffee, tea and as a real treat - tea with milk. To eat? Plastic packets containing some sort of sweetbread, and hard, even (dare I say it!) stale bread rolls. None of the trappings of a usual continental breakfast. Absolutely none. Nothing cooked, no cereals, no toast, no yoghurts, no fruit, no cold meat, nothing. To their credit, they really did splurge by providing two varieties of jam with which to stain your stale bread roll. How dare these people call the breakfast 'continental'? It's a blatant lie. Then we come to the staff. The blurb informs us that the excellent, english speaking staff, are ready to provide advice on sight seeing and restaurants in the vicinity. Trouble is, that with English as poor as these staff had, the best we managed were confusion filled exchanges. Following a wearying trip in from the airport, around 10 o'clock at night, after hauling our bags down Via Giolitti, we were greeted by a man of not many teeth, nor many years left to live, who was bemused when we asked him, quite specifically, about local steakhouses. Then, he had a Eureka moment, and remembered to reccomend a restaurant that I can only presume is linked to the hotel from the name - Restaurant Center . We had the good sense to not follow his incoherent directions, and instead decided to brave the McDonalds that night. If the breakfast matched the dinner in any way, then I can say we were better off. The rooms. Oh yes. The rooms. Fair play, they are clean, and the marble finish perhaps doesn't make the adjective 'Spartan' the most apt one, but I'm going to use it anyway. The sattelite television did not work, the minifridge was not stocked (that is not the impression that is given in any blurb), in the bathroom, instead of the usual soap and shampoo bottles there were the stingiest offerings of detergent I have ever seen - literally condiment sachets of Shampoo. Three of them. You'd use about 2 just washing your hair. They were not replaced until the third day of our stay. The towels? Don't expect anything downy, these are strictly efficient sheets of linen designed to soak up water. Then there is the air conditioning. Firstly, it is noisy, but secondly one has to contact reception to turn it on and off. There is absolutely no need for centrally controlled air conditioning in this day and age, and is more of a disgrace seeing that this hotel was renovated in 2004. Then there was the noise. No, not any kind of noise from street level. A much more insidious one. A low 'click click click' from behind the headboard of the bed. Intermittent, unpredictable, and like some Greek vision of hell, this repetitous sound made sleep impossible. Only by going without sleep for one night, and then tiring myself out utterly in Rome for the day, did I eventually nod off on the second day of my visit. No such luck on the third night of my stay. Guess I just hadn't gone without enough sleep. We complained, and all the staff did was to promise to get maintenence to look at it in the morning. Clearly they never did, as the clicking persisted. My advice is to try and get a room in the older east wing of the property, where there are no headboards on the beds. (My father's room was in the east wing, and he slept soundly, though, he would sleep through a war.) In Hotel Center 3, one can only get to rooms in the west wing of the property by using a cramped lift. This lift can carry just 3 people, and is unresponsive to calls most of the time, meaning that getting down to reception in the morning can take the best part of 5 minutes, as there is no stairwell access (save for the emergency exit that leads down to the street outside). What's worse, is that the lift actually stuck on our way up to our room once. A claustrophobe's worst nightmare, or indeed, anyone who is terrified of being trapped in a lift, would be well advised to give this hotel a miss. This hotel was well below the three start standard that my family and I paid for, in a terrible part of town, and unfortunately we just did not do our research. There are 2 star pensione and youth hostels in the areas adjoining to the Spanish Steps and the Vatican that are miles ahead of this dump. Location, Location Location - let that be your watch word.The lack of AC and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies (although everyone is polite and no one is pushing) is a slight turn off.I'll preface this review by stating that I'm quite grouchy due to the fact that I haven't been able to sleep for the past four nights, so take these comments for what they're worth, but I am so horribly disappointed by this hotel that I have decided to write my first TripAdvisor review as a rebuttal to all the glowing reviews that led me to book here in the first place. As most people do, I'll start with the positive, what little there is. This hotel oozes with style. From the lobby to the rooftop pool, everything is visually quite stunning. It's sophisticated and modern in an urban way that seems just right in such a stylish city. The room I'm in has a beautiful wood floor, a lovely minimalist bathroom with sliding glass doors and slate tile floor, and the furnishings are very cleverly laid out so as to maximize space. The location is very convenient, walking distance from just about everything and the Jaume I metro station is about a block away for what lies outside of walking distance. There's an organic supermarket down the street (and room in the minibar fridge to put things) as well as cafes and banks and pharmacies - anything you'd need. I'll admit that I picked this hotel mainly for its location and I was not at all disappointed in that regard. The staff, too, at least the ones I've encountered so far, have been nothing but friendly, helpful and gracious. Nothing all that exceptional, but definitely everything you would hope for. I don't fault them one bit. HOWEVER Underneath this sleek exterior is a whole wealth of aggravatingly poor design and planning. The bed, for example. It looks beautiful the way they make it up and very inviting after an arduous cross-Atlantic flight. It's quite bouncy, good for jumping, I'd imagine, and I'm seriously not at all picky about beds - I'll happily dream away on the hardest of futon mattresses - but I can actually feel the springs poking up through the skimpy cushioning and I can't fall asleep for more than a few hours without one of my limbs falling asleep. This morning I noticed a bruise on my hipbone from lying on one side for too long. My neck and shoulders ache something fierce and I now understand why they put little note cards everywhere advertising in-room massages. After sleeping on their beds, you'll need one. My second major complaint: the lighting in the rooms. There is not enough of it. And what little there is is so infuriatingly poorly positioned it makes me want to scream. In the lobby, the poor lighting feels moody and seems almost appropriate. But there is no excuse for what they've managed to do in the rooms. There are three recessed overhead lights, one directly above (maybe slightly behind) the head of the bed, one directly above the sink and one above and slightly in front of the toilet. There is also a desk lamp on the desk, some sort of lighting inside the closet and a coil of Christmas lights behind the headboard that serves only to add atmosphere. That sounds like enough, doesn't it? Well, the desk lamp is perfectly functional, I won't complain about it. And the atmospheric closet and bed lights do what they set out to do well enough. But the light above the bed is pointed in such a way so as to blind you should you want to read in bed lying on your back and if you should try to turn over and lie on your stomach, it takes some real effort to position yourself and the book in such a way that the pages are illuminated. And it also somehow fails to sufficiently light the side of the room it is responsible for. The light over the sink also points straight down, casting shadows on the face, making it impossible to see in the mirror. I caught a reflection of myself in the mirror of a well-lit bathroom yesterday and I absolutely looked like a clown, having applied too much blush and crooked eyeliner. And my boyfriend keeps cutting himself shaving. The third overhead light, over the toilet is totally mysterious to me. It allows you to see the floor in front of you perfectly, and somehow fails to pour any of its light into the shower, making it the darkest single corner in the room. I simply don't understand it. Speaking of the bathroom, it certainly looks very pretty and modern and spotlessly clean. But if anyone anywhere in the hotel flushes their toilet while you happen to be in the shower, the water turns scalding hot for a good 10 seconds. The showerhead is on one of those poles where you can slide it up and down to your desired height, which seems quite nice until you realize that there is no way to make the showerhead stay where you have put it and have to do a kind of dance in order to remain in the stream of water. And the shower has no door or curtain, only a panel of glass 2 or 3 feet wide that does nothing to prevent the entire bathroom from getting wet. The walls are very thin and poorly soundproofed and, even though I thought I had booked an "Executive Room" on a high floor with views over the city, I was instead lucky enough to be assigned a (cheaper, smaller) room overlooking a playground where children can be heard screaming until well past midnight. I have a few other smaller complaints, like the food we ordered from room service late last night being pretty bad, though admittedly very prompt and convenient at 4 in the morning when we couldn't sleep, the air conditioner is rigged so that it turns off when you leave the room, meaning you always come back to a room that is hot and stuffy, and the rooftop pool, albeit totally picturesque, doesn't have nearly enough seating to accommodate the number of hotel guests who want to spend time there, and from what I can tell, all the seats are snagged up early in the day by the middle-aged British tourists who sit there all day swilling their wine and discussing their assets (I'm not even being facetious - at the pool today I overheard two distinct groups of people discussing their vast finances) and, at least for me, standing room only and people twice my age acting half as mature makes enjoying a glass of wine on the rooftop at sunset more or less impossible. I haven't been to the gym yet, but I passed by it today and it looks like all the equipment is brand new and, like the rest of the hotel, it's very clean. Same goes for the business center. In short, it seems to me that what you are paying for when you book a room at the Grand Hotel Central is the decor, the location and the courteous staff. Everyone and everything is nice and pretty. But take all that away and you are left with a hotel I wouldn't spend $60 a night to stay in, let alone 200 Euros. This hotel has everything you could possibly desire, except for what's most important: beds you can sleep on, showers you can shower in and functional lighting - pretty serious oversights in my book.This made it obvious that the food wasn't cooked fresh; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated.My husband and I, along with extended family from all over the west and a group of friends from home made our yearly trip to the GN Feb. 13-17. I have never been so disappointed - the service/atmosphere has changed tremendously for the worse. We (the entire group) had seven rooms in the North Tower on different levels. Two rooms in the South Tower as they were "sold out" in the North. It was Valentine's holiday so my husband decided to surprise me with a Club Room. It was a beautiful room with tasteful appointments - cd player complete with Frank Sinatra cds, large plasma/hd tv, clock with iPod station, free bottled Figi water,etc. However, coffee promised near elevator? It was there one morning during our stay. The "food/snacks" consisted of m&m's, granola, chocolate covered rasins and a bowl of apples. It was there one day but all of it was gone by 11am over the weekend and not refilled all day. I had an apple on the day we checked in and found a bottle of water. The goodies were in bowls with spoons but I saw ppl dip there hands in for a handful. eww! The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows! Bathroom was nice with tv built into the mirror. Bath robes and slippers provided. Our maid was wonderful and our room was cleaned to perfection every day. Do NOT expect "express room service" as it took an hour and a half to get mediocre food at room service rates. You can hear everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) in the room next to you. We were on the 17th floor. WiFi did not work for our stay. Pretty pointless to book a room on this level unless you really stay in the room the entire stay. View was of the mountains in background. Nothing special. Here's the ugly... Casino - As stated, we were on a yearly trip always staying at GN with family and friends. We were there in August for our anniversary and labor day with a wonderful stay too. So we are really wondering.. WHAT HAPPENED???? At the end of this trip three of us had been verbally accosted - I was called a [-] by a pit supervisor in front of everyone remaining at the table! 3 card poker with some great ppl from MN and others. I had previously heard some mumblings about us "midwesterners" but let it go. Instead of simply stating "Hi folks, It's late and I will be closing this table down in 10 minutes" we kind of chuckled as the pit boss walked by and quietly upped the minimum from 5 per hand, to 10, to 25 without a word. We had been playing for a couple of hours at wayyy more than the minimum, having fun with the dealer (who was very nice btw) and tipping as well. Perfectly understandable that they would close down a table if it were empty but it was not. When the "pit supervisor" upped it to 25 (remember 3 card is 3 bets!) I had money on the table and was finishing a hand while others looked on. This guy arrogantly called the bet off as I "was not playing the minimum bet". Huh? You just turned it in the middle of a hand!? I was not happy at all but when I went to walk away.. he called me that in front of everyone in the casino and loud enough to hear. When I turned and said "what did you just call me?" He had the audacity to repeat it. Even the kind ppl who had been sitting next to me were in awe. I really don't know who this guy thought he was but wow..there was absolutely no reason for it. We could not believe that in a casino hotel of this "caliber" had no GM on duty. This guy just grinned and asked "what are YOU going to do about it?" No manager was on duty or at least no one wanted to deal with me -I was crying at that point. Go figure. This is not our first trip ..take a look at my profile - not pretentious or a snob of any kind. I simply like kind ppl, comfortable surroundings and beleive that you should take care of your "guests". You simply expect someone in upper management to contact you about such an issue even the next morning. They were probably all off playing on a holiday weekend - this is Wednesday evening and we have heard nothing. I must say one lady who was also a pit super from that evening sent to pacify me..so "generously" took off a whopping 35.00 charge from our bill on our final day. The head of security at least called back but told us to write to the GM. Wow. (and he/she can't take care of this because???) On another evening - late on our last night our friends wanted to gamble before bed so they were at the crap table where one guy was referred to as an "[-] in front of everyone. I was on my way to my room when our friends called me over. The dealers will mock you behind your back so watch out - this guy had played for days on several trips to this casino, tips well and is one of the nicest guys you will meet. Also, know that the F word flies freely so consider yourself warned if you are sensitive to this kind of language. I hope if you decide to gamble here you understand these guys can rip you off and call you every name in the book and WILL get away with it. I don't know what is going on with this place but for these reasons we will head to another casino on our next trip. Since I don't want to just list the bad - we had fun despite the situations (they are NOT going to get away with wrecking our trip) here are some good points- We did meet many nice guests and I really enjoyed playing craps with the couple next to me who had the most amazing roll I have ever seen. Congrats again dear - you deserved it! During warm months the pool is amazing. There were many ppl IN the heated pool but it was too cold to lay out near it or that is where I would have stayed after the casino assault. The bar near the pool serves amazing bloody marys. :) Rent a cabana -so nice. The RED restaraunt for sushi is wonderful and the wine bar is quite nice for socializing. Carson Cafe had great food and drinks for reasonable resort prices. Next time to Vegas we will try Four Queens - we spent much of the next day there gambling and found the dealers and bartenders (while playing Video Poker) to be the best! I love staying downtown as it is fun to be able to visit many casinos in one area DH is returning with friends next week but is NOT returning to GN. It's a shame that such a beautiful hotel has such ugly staff and needs so much improvement before we will ever return. One more note..we have also stayed at NY/NY, Bellagio and Binions before the GN and if you check our trips it is a VERY rare occasion when I have something negative to say. This took the cake.We stayed in January for 1 week. (7 people 3 rooms) It was terrible. Stay somewhere else. The food at the hotel was adequate. Pool burgers ($15) were Okâ€¦..salads were better. Best deal poolside is the large hot dog with a side of salad for $8.00. The lunch buffet looked just fair and overpriced at $26. One ice tea looked like mud and it was easily substituted with Arizona Tea. We went to the Italian restaurant in the hotel. It was Okâ€¦.even Ok++ The gnocchi and veal got the best vote. Service was very good. We went to Mortonâ€™s in the hotel. It was goodâ€¦..but it was freezing cold. Most of us had a collared short sleeve golf shirt on and it was a little brisk. Someone should have done something about the screaming 3 year old in the center section booth. The 60 minutes of screaming pretty much ruined our 7 meals. I would blame the parents first, and then the staff. The ice tea was, â€œas thick as mud,â€� and was sent back. We ordered the $8.95 side of baked potato and it never came out, but we did get to pay for it. The bone in rib eye was quite good, as was the Filet Oscar. The fillet looked Ok, but recieved very good reviews tableside. The sautÃ©ed mushrooms were outstanding, as was the overall service. We dropped $400 for dinner (without tip), 7 people, 2 beers, no desserts. It was good, overpriced, and I left unimpressed. You might find it better. A can of local light beer (Medalla) at the pool-side bar was an outrageous $6.96â€¦..add a couple of dollars for a tip and you are at $9.00 per beer. Surely not worth it, and the hotel management should â€œwake upâ€� and change the pricing. Medalla is similar to our Miller Light here in the states. The little Mini-Mart 85 meters from the lobby probably does a booming business. The marketing genius that suggested to management to charge $20 per unreturned towel has shown that he has never stayed at a good 4 star hotel. Nor, more than likely, will he ever be employed by one. Yes, you want your cheap blue and white towels back, but donâ€™t beat us up. It will get mentioned by people that rate your hotel. The concierge service was a cut above even though they were in the process of physically moving the desks and rebuilding. It took several days of tearing out and measuring, more tearing, and more measuring for everything to be moved. After the concierge desk was moved, they put up white plastic from floor to ceiling in the lobby, and began to fire nails through studs and into the concrete floor. The gun shots sounded like 9mmâ€™s being fired a distance of 5 meters with 40 mils of white plastic protecting customers that were walking down to the HonorsTower. We all ducked when the random shots were fired. The first time through was a little scary. They took good care of the two large parrots in the lobby, but let the customers walk past what sounded like a shooting range at a close distance. It was funny watching people duck. To finish with the concierge, they were extremely helpful. We dealt with at least 3 or 4 of them. They were all very good. One stands out as a â€œcan doâ€� hustler type that went the extra yard for us and was very professional. I approached him at the desk and he was excellent in highlighting the way to the Bacardi Factory Tour. (tour was Ok) I didnâ€™t get his name, but he is the only young thin large guy there that is 6â€™ 5â€� tall. Heâ€™s got the right â€œcan doâ€� attitude and is extremely professional. They were quick to make things correctâ€¦..should have been more proactiveâ€¦. than reactive. All 3 rooms had some degree of mold. Our room stunk like mold. This really ruined the stay for me. My wife is allergic to mold and we had to request the maid service to clean the mold from the shower ceiling. (It works better if you pay to have an extra service completed) We were told the renovations were done 1 year ago. It sure didnâ€™t look like it. The carpet looked like it was 5 to 10 years old. The sliding track balcony door didnâ€™t. The paint was slopped over all the outlet switches. The air conditioner appeared as thought it was original. (30 years old) It was filthy with moldâ€¦..and no filter. These types of conditions are unacceptable. The air conditioner was hard-wired to the slider, so that if the balcony slider was open, the air conditioner wouldnâ€™t work. So you had a choice, either a cool moldy roomâ€¦..or a hot fresh smelling room. Two poor choices for spending $5m on 3 rooms for 7 days. Portions of the hallway ceiling were cutout (drywall pull through holes) and remained unrepaired. This is unacceptable. Two of our rooms had nightstand lamps, one room didnâ€™t. A good Red Roof Inn would have been better than this. We got a 30 year old concreted moldy room that had been painted about 4 times. Furniture looked like it was 20+ years old. The 1.6 gpf toilet still had the tattered label on the front of it about 6â€� off the floor. The plumber never took it offâ€¦.nor did the maid service. This is the sign of a dirty room. Ironically, it was a modern low gallons per flush toiletâ€¦.but ours had a slow leak all day. (it is leaking right now) The small shampooâ€™s and mouth wash contents were horrible. The boxed bar soap was fair. I have traveled for over 30 yearsâ€¦..and this was some of the worst. Tasted and smelled like they were bulk packaged and poured out by bucket in the basement. You may like them, but ours stayed behind. The hallway ceiling drywall had "pull throughs".....square holes every 20 feet. (probably to pull cable through) Never fixed. Some in our group were at this very same location 30 years ago when it was new. (and this was the 3rd visit for them!) It's my last visit. Did I mention the loose stainless steel outdoor handrails outside the towers. No one cares! Probably broken for 20 years! As you can tell, I was unimpressed with this hotel, as well as, the entire island. If you like "dirt" go visit there. It's as close to 3rd world as I have ever seen. Rainforest was Ok. Taxi's were Ok. Several pictures attached. (pictures don't lie)Awful Awful Awful!!! This hotel is the stuff nightmares are made out of!! I stayed recently for 3 nights as I was attending a last minute event at Earl’s Court and everything else close by was either sold out far in advance or was over £200 a night. That should have been my warning sign!! On check-in at 10pm at night, we were asked to pay for parking for 3 nights in advance (£36), which I did and was then told to move my car as I parked where vans park. I said there was no sign saying vans only, but I was told it was there. It must be invisible!! Anyway at 10pm with no light on in the car park (there is one, the reception just didn’t bother to put it on) I moved my car in the awkward and cramped car park. I then got the room key and that is when I had a freak out! You can only get 1 person and 1 suitcase at a time into the elevator or 2 people and no bags. When we got out on to the 1st floor the doors were cracked and broken, stains on the carpet, wallpaper falling off and cracks in the ceiling. We got to the room and I had enough. The double bed was against a side and back wall, there was 1 foot width of space at the side of the bed to the window, and there was wallpaper hanging off the wall on to the pillow. There was also a small shelf area and a cupboard but nowhere to put our 2 suitcases except on the bed itself. I went back to reception and asked for a bigger room but was told only a twin was available. I didn’t book a twin. I booked a double and asked how they could expect 2 people to stay in that room and have room for bags. The receptionist told me I could take the twin and move the beds around and when I asked if he would help us do that, he said no as it was light enough for us to move ourselves! This time, we got the lift to the 2nd floor. This was as bad if not worse than the 1st as some of the light casing was broken and there were wires on view. We moved the twin beds together to create a double and with the extra space managed to put our cases between the bed and the wall. This was not good when we were trying to move I can tell you. The windows were dirty, the frames cracked, and there was no air con so the room was roasting hot. We had to sleep with the windows open, if you could call the 3 nights of tossing and turning from nightmares thinking I was in Bates Motel sleep!! Our room was at the front so it was on the main road where there is constant traffic so constant noise too. We had 1 bath towel and 1 hand towel for the 2 of us and only 1 pillow each but we did ask and get more. There is no hair dryer and the coffee mugs were dirty and the coffee sachets covered in something sticky so we didn’t chance using them! I know this hotel was ridiculously cheap at £80 a night for London and I wasn’t really expecting air con, but 2 feet of space, a clean glass and somewhere to put my suitcase is not too much to ask for an establishment that has the cheek to call itself a hotel! On our 1st morning we went into the small cramped bathroom where we were greeted by the lovely sight of the pipes of our sink uncovered, dusty and very very worn. And then we spotted the previous guests dirty face cloth still on the shower rail. On our way down to breakfast we gave it to reception who did not say a word! No apology. Nada! There are signs all over the hotel about how they will not accept liability for items stolen from your room but you can leave them with reception to lock away. We had laptops with us and practically had to argue with reception for them to take them behind for us as if we had left them in the rooms and anything did happen then what would happen? Were they just paranoid or is there a history of theft? I don’t know but this made me a little scared to be honest as it was being made into such a big deal! The breakfast room is in the basement. You know this will be a disaster! The stairs on the way down had several empty bottles of alcohol lying on them so some guests had had a party the night before and not only was it not cleared, it was a health and safety problem! The smell and the heat of the breakfast room was disgusting. Luckily though we managed to get some boxed cereal. While the kitchen looked clean enough the smell was enough to make us loose our appetites and cereal was all we could manage. And for future reference, they don’t have the cereal sitting out, but we saw empty boxes and asked for some. Service with a smile this was not! More like service with a sneer! 10 minutes to get a cup of coffee and warm milk for the cereal! We decided to use the toilet beside the breakfast room on our way out to save us going back to the hell hole of a room. This was a mistake. The ladies had a dirty towel lying on the floor and I gagged when I saw the state of the toilet which was covered in excrement. I practically ran out of there! I have seen some nasty public toilets in my time, but in a hotel? It was just wrong! The next 2 days were pretty much the same. Then on our final day (checkout was 11am) I asked if we could leave the car in the car park until 5pm as we did not check-in until 10pm and I had paid for 3 nights parking. First of all I was told ‘No. You have only paid for 1 night’. I said I had paid for 3. Just by chance I kept the receipt and I showed it to the receptionist who still didn’t believe me until she could find a hand written record of it. When I told her which was my car I was then told ‘You’re the owner. We didn’t know who’s that car was’! Even though I gave them my registration at check-in?? Crazy! When I asked again if I could leave my car until 5pm I was told ‘No, you must pay another £12’. Thankfully the area is not a controlled parking zone on Sundays so I left and found a parking space on the street. No way was I ever going to give them another penny! At £80 / night... yes this is very cheap for London... but No way will I stay there again. It’s worth paying the extra for a comfortable nights’ sleep and some sanity!! Over a week later I still get shivers thinking about how awful it was! Do not stay here!I'm in NYC 10-20 a year for business, staying at all levels of hotels depending on company budget, policies and deals. I know what to expect from each grade of hotel. I wound up at the Paramount due to a client deal that covered my room and tax. Even if it were free again, I'd never stay here a next time. The room: NY hotel rooms are small but smart hotels offer storage and work solutions that maximize space. This had nothing. I was in 1841 which felt like the maid's room - and as I learned from the room guide, it probably was since the 18th floor was the original hotel's attic. The room was spartan: bed, one nightstand, a chair. No desk despite sufficient space for it (also no real dresser). A sad lopsided floor lamp. There was some rolling tray table that fit over the bed or in front of the lone chair. Great concept if every guest is over 5'8". I'm 5'4" and this was completely useless, too high. I had no place to do work. The closet was entirely taken up with a clumsy two-drawer cabinet that left only a 4" space to hang clothes...space further reduced by 1/2 because the ironing board was also stored there. So if you want to hang anything longer than a shirt, you can't. The bathroom is terribly outdated, with cheap 1980s metal fixtures. The room was dirty. Not in need of dusting or vaccuuming but a deep serious cleaning. It had two nasty decorative pillows on the bed that I couldn't toss on the floor fast enough with as little touching as possible. The toilet this disgusting black ring around the bowl at the water line. The toilet should've been replaced. It looked like mold was starting in the shower. The shower curtain didn't even reach the floor so water ran out everywhere. The ceiling vent in the bathroom hasn't been cleaned in ages and was full of black dust. I hated touching any surface in the room. I had no washclothes (my colleague had them daily). I had a $10 travel hairdryer; my colleague got a full-sized one. I was so busy on business that I didn't bother to try and change rooms. And the room was simply rundown. The rolling tray table was chipped. The walls were gouged, needing spackling and repair. Several doorframes were corroded at their bases. On the very last morning, I saw that one wall had been cut open for someone to reach an electrical box and hadn't been repaired but instead left peeling and fraying. Even the room service hangtag was beaten up, dirty and frayed - it looked as if no one had been in this room in a decade. The room condition was a disgrace. It was also unsafe: the marble threshold (the piece of marble that serves as the transition on the floor as you step from the bedroom into the bathroom) was abnormally high on the room side and I tripped the first time I went into the bathroom. The height of the threshold is probably in violation of NYC laws. It took nearly 5 minutes to get hot water in the shower. So I'd turn it on, do many other things and then come back to find it suitable. And a small but important point: someone had filled the peephole with gum or something. It was unnerving. If I had decided to spend one more minute than I needed to in the room, I would've alerted the desk to have it fixed. But the dismal condition and user-unfriendliness of the room kept me out of it as often as possible. Which cost the hotel several hundred dollars since I'm normally a room service user. Instead, I ran out as quickly as I could. A final point was check-in. Because of my travel schedule, I arrived too early to get my room - which was fine - but the woman at the front desk said she'd check me in and all I needed to do was stop back for the key. She saw that the room and tax were being covered. She asked for, looked at and made note of my photo ID. Oddly, she didn't want a credit card imprint although I would be responsible for non-room/tax costs. All set, she said. I returned 8 hours later to get my key before rushing out to dinner. What I encountered at the desk: --first, the man (Sean) couldn't find my reservation --once he did, he insisted that "there is nothing noted that the room and tax are paid for" - I kept reiterating that I'd already checked in and it had shown up at that time; he kept claiming otherwise --finally he found the room arrangements note but said the woman earlier hadn't taken my photo ID documentation. Useless now to argue with him. Plus, as should've been done originally, my credit card imprint was taken --I decided to use a particular card that's both a platinum-level Visa card ($8000 a day limit) and a debit card. Sean refused to use it as a credut card - despite the fact that it's noted as such on the card itself and had he run it as credit it would've been approved - and would only take it as a debit,. Which as he explained, required that a certain amount be withheld to cover incidentals in advance. Which wasn't appropriate but again, it was uesless trying to get him to understand. While the amount was nominal (and as explained, I had no interest in generating any additional costs in the hotel), he seemed to have no understanding about such cards or in even running the card as credit to see he was wrong. I've charged multi-day stays at better-quality hotels on this particular card with no problem but apparently it was too difficult for the Paramount. Instead, this guy wasted my time as I headed to a business dinner, This place is a dump with service to match. There are numerous comparably-priced hotels in the area that are better-designed and better-maintained. Use them instead.I had a problem at this hotel. The husband and wife team that run this hotel seem like nice people, but try to complain, and they go on the attack, and they are vicious and relentless. Be warned. I expect to be harassed because I am posting this review. The following is a true account of what happened to me. After kicking us out two days in a row to clean our room, the maid had yet to remove the dirty glassware or clean the room properly. The mirror in the bathroom had tooth flossing specks on it, not from us. There was mildew on the grout in the bathtub. The glass topped coffee table had grease on both sides of the glass and the rug and not been vacuumed. The windows on the french doors were dirty on both sides--these windows were easily accessible, and oddly, the other windows in the window seat area, which were harder to get at, were clean. The room was actually very nice, one of the best in the hotel. And with 10 minutes and some windex and bleach, all would have been fine. However, when I tried to explain this to Hans, one of the owners of the hotel, he went ballistic. I was not aware that complaining was not permitted in their hotel. While we were alone in my room, this intimidating man became irate. He yelled at me for being too demanding! I told him maybe he was unaware that the maid wasn't taking care of all the details when cleaning even though she made such a point of kicking us out of our room for her to clean it. The first day we were there. We were so jet lagged we went back to bed and were fast asleep when the maid walked in on us! We had put the "do not disturb" sign on the door, but she said it had fallen on the floor. She didn't even knock! She insisted that she had to clean the room immediately and gave us 10 minutes to dress and get out. We were too groggy to stand up for ourselves, or to complain about such treatment. The next day, my husband had left to work at the trade show but I was still in the room when she came in and wanted to clean it. So I grabbed my stuff and got out. When I got back I noticed she made the bed and changed the towels. I went downstairs to get some ice and since the ice bucket that had been in our room was not clean, I went into the kitchen and washed it in the sink with some dish soap. I was approached by one of the other employees who asked what I was doing. I told her that the ice bucket had not been clean and I wanted to wash it before putting ice in it. I told her things in our room were not as clean as I would have hoped they would be. A few minutes later, Hans came up with windex and bleach. He said something about that he had told the maid to bleach the mildew in the tub, and he went in to do that. I took the windex and started to do the bathroom mirror and he went ballistic. I pointed out the toothpaste spray on the mirror and said that it had been there since we arrived, and suggested that he might have a problem with his maid not doing her job properly. And we didn't appreciate her walking in on us or kicking us out of our room when we had obviously been asleep! Hans started shouting at me about how unreasonably picky I was being and that everything can't be perfect in a room. He then ran his hand over the top of the armoire and it came down covered with dust! I had no idea what his point was, I wasn't even complaining about the dust, but it was comic how he was raging defensively about how clean the room was and it was actually even dirtier than I had noticed. About a half hour later I was having trouble using the wireless internet, so I went downstairs to try the set-up they have for the guests that don't have laptops, and I saw some windex and a towel next to the computer. So I borrowed these items and took the opportunity to clean the stuff that had been bothering me. I replaced the items when I was done. I sent an email to Loes, who was my initial contact when I booked my stay. She is the wife of Hans and from what I can tell, a co-owner. I told her "This is not acceptable behavior. I would like someone to apologize to me in a civil manner and I expect polite treatment and good service for the remainder of my stay." Then she called to shout at me and tell me how happy she is with all of her staff. And since I did not like my room, I could move out immediately! Now she was being spiteful. With the one of the biggest trade shows of the year in town, there was no way I was going to be able to find anything, and I was not the one that was unable to control my temper. I told her I would see what I could do. And I told her that since I had had a chance to clean the room, it was satisfactory. But that only made her angrier. She came to my door and pounded on it! I told her I was not going to open the door or participate in a shouting match. I told her if she could find a comparable room at another hotel, I would move. She tried, but couldn't come up with anything. So I was stuck wondering everytime I went out whether my stuff was safe in a place where they were so rude and wanted to get me out so badly. And worrying every time I came in that I would see Hans or Loes and they would yell at me again. They got to save some money, because we did not go down to breakfast. We ate out rather than risk any confrontation. That's okay. Hans rules over the breakfast room and our first morning we must have come down later than he wished, even though it was still within the allotted breakfast time. So there was no fresh squeezed orange juice for us! I went online to trip advisor and sorted by one star reviews. I found multiple complaints about them bullying their customers! Guess I should have done more research... To prevent more confrontations, I sent her an email telling her that since she and Hans could not seem to control their tempers, that the only way I would communicate with them was by email. And that they both owed me an apology. There was no apology, and though we had scheduled more days after the trade show, we got out of there as soon as we could. One more little annoyance. We paid extra to get the largest room size because it featured a double bed that was a real double bed, not two singles stuck together. But the bed was topped by two small (probably single size) duvet-like things instead of one that fit the bed. The overlap was pretty small, so In the middle of the night, they would slip around on the bed and create a gap right where we were trying to sleep together. They topped it with a thin chenille bedspread that was the right size, so things looked okay on the surface. It's a shame. It is a nice hotel with a lot of great perks. But the inability of the management to control their negative emotions makes it intolerable. Amsterdam has lots of wonderful places to stay. This is not one of them.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Sandos Riviera resort which is rated 4 stars .... they share the same restaurants with other old Sandos property which is 3 stars, buffet restaurants almost never change their tablecloth , so nasty, you have to check at least 7-8 tables to find one with a less nasty, dirty tablecloth... food is horrible , even at a La Carte , for 7 days stay just 3 reservations allowed to a La Carte , if you are lucky, same rule for 3 star old Sandos resorts/ which almost always booked and you can not get reservations, but clean tablecloth/ . I am not sure how is rating works, but I was staying at 4 stars resort, but with a 3 star restaurants When you finally get in to a La Carte restaurant , half of the tables empty Is that a joke? booked with whom ... empty tables???? Resort just does not want to many people to eat with at a table with a clean tablecloth . Resort wants everyone wait in line for a food at buffet ......First night I woke up with am ants in my bed..... When I checked in and bell boy and me came to my room I saw many crumbs around my bed and on my comforter , I asked him what is this , he just pushed crumbs under my bed with his foot without saying anything. Next morning my bed , floors were covered with ants/ I took photos/. At 7 am I called front desk clerk Oscar who helped me to check in and expressed my problem. He said there is no rooms available I have to wait until after 3 pm. I said but ants are going to eat me alive and will get into my bags???? He replied he will send a bell man to pick up my bags and keep it at the bell boy stand on the front of the resort where I was dropped by a shuttle . I said but I just arrived last night and just woke up and did not go thru my stuff yet, to get ready for a day. He said bell man is on his way to pick up your luggage . I said I am in my PJ and not ready to leave my room. I ask him to speck to a supervisor and call me back. he did not call me back. So I called again and asked him what happened he said we do not have any rooms available. I said but it should not take almost 12 hours in a resort with 300+ room to have one room available sooner . I asked to speak with a supervisor , but Oscar said supervisor will say the same thing. I asked to speak to a Resort manager, he said he does not come in until 9 am. I asked Oscar to pass my message to a Resort manager . 10 AM and still no one called me. I called oscar and asked to what happened he replied resort manager is not in . I asked Oscar to speak to his supervisor ......I mentioned to oscar I took photos of ants on my bed and all over in my room and balcony.... I even found a spot where they were coming from to eat those crumbs were on my bed when I checked in. Oscar said I will send a maid. I said I clean all those crumbs with a tissues and flushed in a toilet, so ants will have no source of the food . I insist of being moved to another room ASAP with my bags, so I could enjoy my first day at the beach with my things , not just hiding somewhere for the day . I mentioned to oscar I paid much higher rate for the room because of 1 person and I want to be able to have a room for my first day, not just have my bags at the front of the hotel...... With in 1 hour I was moved to another room and it was an upgrade which I did not ask. Just want a clean room without crumbs and no ants. Next day I saw much bigger ants on the balcony and some by the windows . I called front desk and asked them to spray just my balcony, not the room. Of course I asked if it it possible to set the time for the guys to come in and spray the balcony. They said yes. It is the same problem , ants found me!!! LOL Resort has large wholes on the bottom of a patio frames, where screws should be , no screws , just big wholes ... at least should off been patched in. I pointed to a bell man who moved me from my first room. He said he will related to someone. I assume it is in every room..... Waiting fir my room to be sprayed at such time... 1 hour later no one......... I wrote a note " please do not spray in my room, just a balcony" and inserted on my way out of my room in key slot. When I came back to my room I smelled very strong chemicals even outside of my room... bad news, was sprayed in my room... so strong.... Ocean breeze .... no..., very strong chemicals ... I starts sneezing, I have a very sensitive nose..... / Use Terminix for many years, as San Diego area has a big ants problem, they spray regularly outside/. Open windows, doors, air conditioning does not work when windows are open....... Terrible hot night .... hot room all night ..... I realize resort put bed padding with a plastic/ kids pee proof material/ . I removed it after sweating my back even with a very air conditioned room.... Horrible! Window coverings so short and not connected to the wall ..... 6 am... bright sun shining outside .. so as my room.... No window covering or with it.. almost the same..... Best day rep called me first morning and was trying to get me to come down to see them to sign travel voucher for shuttle to airport/ then they will try to sell you all tours, still do not understand their system, they should know our info, but they insist of you coming down to do their sales pitch/ . She said they work with Bookit and asked how is everything. I said terrible, I slept with ants , room was dirty , she said call front desk, I said I did , she said I need to come down to sign , I said not today, I have to clean room to stay and it is my main concern, I want to relax and not stressed out. She said buy. They is how they really care if you are ok? Why Best day ask that question and saying they work with Bookit??????? Just want to share one of my worst travel experiences ...... Checking in in a dirty room . Sleeping with an ants . Spending first day asking to change a room , to be without ants 7 days of bad food with a dirty tablecloth / only 1 dinner buffet Italian had a clean table cloth , which was open to all of us just 2 nights.... 10 minutes walk to the beach on a heat with a bag..... ok, unexpected hike few times a day on a heat/ I love swimming so normally 3 times a day, no pools fro me/ Resort lets you borrow a bike, but bikes are so old , being repainted sooooooo many times and do not work properly, do not dream about about hand brakes or ringing bell... A la carte restaurants always booked , but when you are finally get in... food is soooo bad.... Medeterrenian was a better one 10 minutes walk to a buffet .... You be the judge of my vacation....Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

This was our first visit to Las Vegas and our experience at the Mirage totally ruined our trip. Here's why we will NEVER again set foot in the Mirage: 1) We were assigned a room that was already occupied by another guest Upon opening the door to our room, we discovered that it was already occupied by someone, who, needless to say, was none too pleased to have 2 strangers barging in on him while he was in bed. It was an extremely embarrassing incident for both us and for the poor person we intruded upon. However, more serious a matter than that of embarrassment was the utter lack of security in the hotel. Had that guest not been in his room, and had we been so inclined, we could have easily walked out of the room with whatever money and valuables he left in the room, thinking that they would be safely locked up in the room. To compound matters, when we went back down to the front desk, the staff did not appear the least bit alarmed that such a grave mistake had been made, and blithely issued us keys to another room. This encounter led us to conclude that the Mirage must frequently make such errors, given the lack of concern displayed by the staff. 2) We were assigned the wrong room (again) Upon entering room number 2, we discovered that there was only 1 bed. We found this to be unacceptable, as we had been told when we had tried to check in earlier that afternoon that a room with 2 beds would only be ready in 2-3 hours, and we would have to check in later that day if we still wanted a 2-bed room. Hence, when we returned later that night to check in, we were fully expecting that the hotel would honour our request and give us the room we wanted. We called to ask for another room, and were told that someone from security would meet us outside room number 3 to let us in, so that we would not have to make another trip to the front desk to collect new keys. However... 3) We were assigned the wrong room YET AGAIN We met security at room number 3. He opened the door to reveal a room with 1 bed. After another angry call, we were eventually given a room with 2 beds, and offered a $75 food and beverage credit. Needless to say, our faith in the Mirage and the level of security proferred to its guests had been severely undermined by then. As such..... 4) We could not enjoy our day trip to the Grand Canyon due to constant fear and worry about the security of our possessions While on our day trip to the Grand Canyon on the 2nd day of our stay in Las Vegas, our minds were preoccupied with the constant fear that our possessions in our room were not secure and we were unable to fully concentrate on and enjoy our visit to the Grand Canyon. Our fears were not unfounded, as it seems, because upon returning to our room that night after the trip to the Grand Canyon, we discovered that... 5) Both our key cards didn't work. And there were 2 empty champagne glasses sitting just outside our room In light of what happened to us the night before, the only conclusion we could come to was that the staff must have assigned our room to another guest or at the very least that someone else could possibly have entered our room with the wrongful authorisation of the hotel. When we went to the front desk to demand an explanation for being locked out of our own room, we were further agitated because the staff merely offered to have housekeeping clear the glasses and issue us new keys, and did not appear to understand why we were so upset. When we asked why we should believe, after what had happened the previous night, that it was not possible that our room, or access to it, had been erroneously given to someone else, the staff were unable to give us any satisfactory assurance or justification, and could only insist that we were the only guests registered to the room. After our extremely unpleasant experience the night before, we could hardly have been expected to believe that claim. 6) While checking out, we were told that someone named Medina Maribou was also registered to our room and asked to confirm which credit card to charge the bill to This, after the repeated assurances from the staff the night before that we were the only registered guests. We promptly lost every last little shred of faith we had in the ability of the hotel to get things right. In fact, we can only hope desperately at this stage that our credit card does not remain on the hotel's records and has not been wrongly assigned to someone else's room. 7) Our bill wrongly included charges of $70+ spent at one of the hotel restaurants This error seems minor in comparison to everything we had been put through, and the front desk removed this item from our bill readily enough after we pointed out that we had been given a $75 F&B credit. However, we would have expected more care to be taken, given our numerous complaints in just 2 nights. On both nights, because of the Mirage's errors, we went to bed very late and slept very little and badly. We ended up being very tired on the respective days following and were not able to enjoy our visit as much as we had hoped. We have a right to expect, when we pay for accommodation at a hotel, that we would at least have a pleasant and restful night's sleep, and were deeply disappointed that a reputable hotel like the Mirage could fall so dismally short of such an indisputably reasonable expectation. While we did appreciate the Mirage trying to make up for the rotten experience by giving us a $50 discount, most would agree that this gesture was too little too late. As fairly frequent travellers, we have stayed at hotels all over the world and we assure you that we have never had such a singularly unpleasant experience. We are not particularly hard to please or exacting and have given rave reviews about exquisite service and facilities in some hotels that would look like huts next to the Mirage. Unfortunately, should anyone ask about our visit to Las Vegas, we will not be able to say anything nice about our stay at the Mirage, which has ruined our impression of Las Vegas and of tourism standards in the United States. Most critically, in the high-security climate of today's world, especially in the United States, the last thing we would have expected would be such serious breaches of security and such a lax attitude towards security. It most certainly defeats the purpose of having stenuous security measures at higher levels if corresponding actions are not enforced at the ground level. We would most certainly advise all our friends and family to opt for alternative accommodation when visiting Las Vegas, as from our experience, the Mirage is an establishment that could pose a definite danger to their safety and security.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Downtown Chicago is a routine trip for my family of four and each time we select a new hotel downtown to enjoy. This time it was the Allerton Hotel and we were very excited about the chance to stay on the Magnificent Mile near Water Tower Place. The view alone should have been remarkable given the hotel's location. Too bad that wasn't the case. Foremost, entry to the hotel is at the ground level to a drab and unwelcoming baggage claim area. You are instructed to take the elevator to the 2nd floor lobby. These items alone should be immediate warnings that you are about to be disappointed - as you will be. The elevators that you will get on are capable of holding five or maybe six people at maximum - there are closets in Brooklyn that are larger. To add to it, the number of elevators is quite small. 3 total service the 20+ floors of guests. 1 elevator (of same size) services just the first three floors. Oh, and they crawl like snails. You will have to wait overly long for one, and I hope you're not closterphobic as you will be on it for a while. Encountering the lobby is like visiting a cave. It is dark - black desk, black walls, not well lit, and has the feel of a Bosnian regional airport terminal check-in. You're hoping that you can catch the next flight and leave quickly. Here the staff were courtious and friendly - this was one positive I saw throughout the hotel (including bag handlers, maids, and maintenance personnel). A bar / lounge is positioned next to the conceriege. It too was black and drab and never had anyone in it in the times we were there. On to the rooms. Once we were finally delivered to our floor (with those elevators it took quite some time), we opened the door to our assigned room. Let me be perfectly blunt - I was appauled. While it was clean, those closets in Brooklyn were still chuckling and I think walk-in closets in Cleveland were snickering. Two double beds along with a desk and chair had been stuffed into a long and narrow room. The decor was okay, but little else was. There was literally 10 inches of space between the desk and wall in which to squeeze by to enter the space. Luggage had to be picked up and carried over top the desk as there was absolutely no way it would clear the narrow confines otherwise. The curtains were open to the view that would be ours for our three night stay. There was no sunlight but instead a complete and total view of the side of a brick building some 10 feet away. Literally no sunlight in, and no view out - just bricks and mortar to add to drab and dreary. A Bosnia airport terminal would have have more of a view. The bathroom was ample with large sink and a single shower stall with clear glass sliding doors. If you'd rather not be seen in your birthday suit during a shower, don't plan to allow the spouse in the bathroom to simultaniously work at the sink. Oh, and the flush handle of the toilet sticks right out in the walkway - you're sure to flush it on the way to the shower if you're not careful. The only redeeming qualities of the bathroom were a great shower head and water pressure that gave a wonderful shower and the conditioner that the Allerton offered. Ready to go to sleep? I hope not. While the beds look nice, they really aren't beds, but rather trampolines. Seriously, the bounce on these things was incredible. I'm surprised they didn't just bounce themselves out into the trash bin. They made for the worst sleep ever. The beds were tremendously uncomfortable. It's especially obvious how bad they are when my children (both under 10) complain that their backs hurt after a night on the bed. I'd have been more comfortable sleeping on the floor. The only positive was that the sheets and pillows were of good quality - not premium, but acceptable. There is one last dig I have to make on the Allerton and it concerns WiFi. Most downtown Chicago hotels understand that WiFi is important to their guests and willinging provide it freely. It is afterall terribly inexpensive to operate and maintain. However, the Allerton would rather charge you for use to the tune of $10 per day. Talk about nickel and diming to death! The one fortune we found was that a couple of the stores on Michigan Avenue in the near vacinity of the Allerton did freely offer WiFi to their clients and the WiFi signal was strong enough to be used from the room. We had full internet capability through their signal without having to dip into our pockets to laiden the Allerton with more profits. Their stealing a good night's rest from us on the attrocious beds was punishment enough. If you are looking to stay in downtown Chicago and want to be in the area of the Allerton let me strongly suggest the Affinia Hotel instead - one block over. Our experience at that hotel was rather positive. The Allerton was horrid and we shall not return.Stayed here at the end of last year as the hotels I usually stay in we're booked out due to a number of events and conferences in Sydney that weekend. We actually chose the place because the manager responded to feedback on here and we thought that showed respect for patrons and figured we had so much crammed into this one weekend that we would literally only shower and sleep there, so it couldn't be that bad. Man were we wrong! Room was liveable, pretty shabby, but not unhygienic, but probably on par for the usual room rates. I believe looking at the rates now, compared to what we paid, that our rates were jacked up due to the demand for that weekend. The hot water takes ages to heat (probably 20 seconds) and the channel selection on the tv was terrible - all I wanted to see was some Australian News coverage and all I could get was BBC UK! Couldn't even get Sunrise / Today and co, let alone fox news! Location was ok for what we wanted, but it depends where you're planning to go. Worst part was definitely the housekeeping and management. The hallway was filled with the smell of marijuana, and the staff on the desk never appeared interested when it was raised. Rooms weren't made up until late afternoon, which was irritating as the towels are so thin they are saturated after one use, so you throw them on the floor to get changed, come back wanted to shower before dinner and still don't have fresh towels! Worst of all, as I flew straight from work I had my iPad with me. As it was WiFi only it stayed in the room the whole time. We arrived at the hotel at around midnight Friday night and I put it on charge on the desk in the room. Got up early Saturday morning and we were out all day, stopping in for a few 30min - 1 hour blocks and not getting back until probably 1am, the same for the next few days and nights as well. When packing to leave we noticed the iPad was gone, we searched everywhere, nowhere to be found, so we reported it to the front desk and I have never been poorly treated by hotel staff in my life. There was a young man and a woman at the counter and I spoke with the man, advised what had happened and the woman, who was midway through serving another customer started shaking her head and rolling her eyes as I spoke. I asked her if she was alright and she began interrogating us about what we had said asking us rapid fire questions until she became so enraged by our consistent answers that she just barked at us about us not yet reporting it to the police. I explained to the woman that we felt it best, since it was stolen from our locked room and there had been no one in our room but us and their staff, we felt it best to talk to them first, and of course, I wouldn't have had the first clue about the Police station closest to us. I asked them to review their records to see who had been in the room she just said 'yeah we'll get right on that' and laughed. Luckily, the man agreed he would 'look into' it and promised to be there at 4pm to discuss. Upon returning at 4, of course he was no where to be found, and the receptionist tells me he was only rostered until 2! Lucky me, angry woman from the morning was there and I asked her to organise for the manager to call me and explained that we had been to the police and reported it, she started asking for the name of the officer I'd reported it to and I explained that the officers in the station put me on the phone to the reports line, she laughed at me. Next she asked where my 'police card' was and when I said I wasn't sure what she meant she just rolled her eyes. The look of shock as I read the police report number to her out of my phone was priceless, however. Anyway, no call from the manager, so I called them, he said he'd investigate and call back and never did, so I called again and he said he'd asked the staff who said they didn't take it... Gee because they'd admit that, as long as you ask nicely! He then tells me he isn't actually the Manager, he just manages the desk and that the real manager would have to review it to decide if they will accept any liability, wanted any further evidence, ask further questions etc. so I ask when will I hear from him? No... He won't call you, you have to write him a letter! FFS! So I have written him a letter 6 weeks ago, I included a signed statement from myself and my partner about our versions, a statement from the friend who picked us up from the airport who saw me using the iPad to get the address for the hotel, i provided a copy of the original purchase information, a photocopy of the box with the serial number on it and confirmation that I had wiped and locked the iPad. No response, not even an acknowledgement, By the time I'd finally got everything together to send down I'd already replaced the iPad anyway, but it was more the principle, that I hadn't been considered. There are signs in the room saying that if there is a noise complaint they will bill the offender the amount equal to the compensation they pay the complainer (or something to that effect) the fact they would compensate a person for making a noise complaint, but not even acknowledge my complaint is ridiculous. I understand that there are dodgy people out there who probably try to rip them off, but if that was the case, why would I supply proof I owned it, statements from people who saw me with it, and if I still had it, why would I block and lock it! If you aren't going to provide safes, don't hire thieves. If you hire them anyway, at least return people's phone calls or letters. That simple really.My husband and I, along with extended family from all over the west and a group of friends from home made our yearly trip to the GN Feb. 13-17. I have never been so disappointed - the service/atmosphere has changed tremendously for the worse. We (the entire group) had seven rooms in the North Tower on different levels. Two rooms in the South Tower as they were "sold out" in the North. It was Valentine's holiday so my husband decided to surprise me with a Club Room. It was a beautiful room with tasteful appointments - cd player complete with Frank Sinatra cds, large plasma/hd tv, clock with iPod station, free bottled Figi water,etc. However, coffee promised near elevator? It was there one morning during our stay. The "food/snacks" consisted of m&m's, granola, chocolate covered rasins and a bowl of apples. It was there one day but all of it was gone by 11am over the weekend and not refilled all day. I had an apple on the day we checked in and found a bottle of water. The goodies were in bowls with spoons but I saw ppl dip there hands in for a handful. eww! The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows! Bathroom was nice with tv built into the mirror. Bath robes and slippers provided. Our maid was wonderful and our room was cleaned to perfection every day. Do NOT expect "express room service" as it took an hour and a half to get mediocre food at room service rates. You can hear everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) in the room next to you. We were on the 17th floor. WiFi did not work for our stay. Pretty pointless to book a room on this level unless you really stay in the room the entire stay. View was of the mountains in background. Nothing special. Here's the ugly... Casino - As stated, we were on a yearly trip always staying at GN with family and friends. We were there in August for our anniversary and labor day with a wonderful stay too. So we are really wondering.. WHAT HAPPENED???? At the end of this trip three of us had been verbally accosted - I was called a [-] by a pit supervisor in front of everyone remaining at the table! 3 card poker with some great ppl from MN and others. I had previously heard some mumblings about us "midwesterners" but let it go. Instead of simply stating "Hi folks, It's late and I will be closing this table down in 10 minutes" we kind of chuckled as the pit boss walked by and quietly upped the minimum from 5 per hand, to 10, to 25 without a word. We had been playing for a couple of hours at wayyy more than the minimum, having fun with the dealer (who was very nice btw) and tipping as well. Perfectly understandable that they would close down a table if it were empty but it was not. When the "pit supervisor" upped it to 25 (remember 3 card is 3 bets!) I had money on the table and was finishing a hand while others looked on. This guy arrogantly called the bet off as I "was not playing the minimum bet". Huh? You just turned it in the middle of a hand!? I was not happy at all but when I went to walk away.. he called me that in front of everyone in the casino and loud enough to hear. When I turned and said "what did you just call me?" He had the audacity to repeat it. Even the kind ppl who had been sitting next to me were in awe. I really don't know who this guy thought he was but wow..there was absolutely no reason for it. We could not believe that in a casino hotel of this "caliber" had no GM on duty. This guy just grinned and asked "what are YOU going to do about it?" No manager was on duty or at least no one wanted to deal with me -I was crying at that point. Go figure. This is not our first trip ..take a look at my profile - not pretentious or a snob of any kind. I simply like kind ppl, comfortable surroundings and beleive that you should take care of your "guests". You simply expect someone in upper management to contact you about such an issue even the next morning. They were probably all off playing on a holiday weekend - this is Wednesday evening and we have heard nothing. I must say one lady who was also a pit super from that evening sent to pacify me..so "generously" took off a whopping 35.00 charge from our bill on our final day. The head of security at least called back but told us to write to the GM. Wow. (and he/she can't take care of this because???) On another evening - late on our last night our friends wanted to gamble before bed so they were at the crap table where one guy was referred to as an "[-] in front of everyone. I was on my way to my room when our friends called me over. The dealers will mock you behind your back so watch out - this guy had played for days on several trips to this casino, tips well and is one of the nicest guys you will meet. Also, know that the F word flies freely so consider yourself warned if you are sensitive to this kind of language. I hope if you decide to gamble here you understand these guys can rip you off and call you every name in the book and WILL get away with it. I don't know what is going on with this place but for these reasons we will head to another casino on our next trip. Since I don't want to just list the bad - we had fun despite the situations (they are NOT going to get away with wrecking our trip) here are some good points- We did meet many nice guests and I really enjoyed playing craps with the couple next to me who had the most amazing roll I have ever seen. Congrats again dear - you deserved it! During warm months the pool is amazing. There were many ppl IN the heated pool but it was too cold to lay out near it or that is where I would have stayed after the casino assault. The bar near the pool serves amazing bloody marys. :) Rent a cabana -so nice. The RED restaraunt for sushi is wonderful and the wine bar is quite nice for socializing. Carson Cafe had great food and drinks for reasonable resort prices. Next time to Vegas we will try Four Queens - we spent much of the next day there gambling and found the dealers and bartenders (while playing Video Poker) to be the best! I love staying downtown as it is fun to be able to visit many casinos in one area DH is returning with friends next week but is NOT returning to GN. It's a shame that such a beautiful hotel has such ugly staff and needs so much improvement before we will ever return. One more note..we have also stayed at NY/NY, Bellagio and Binions before the GN and if you check our trips it is a VERY rare occasion when I have something negative to say. This took the cake.Terrible This trip was myself and my partner, both 24; my mom who is 54 and her friend who is in her 40's.We booked our trip with Apple Vacations before we read any reviews. After we read the reviews we were a little worried, but figured that many of these people must just be picky, and never satisfied. After all, we have been on many other vacations that we LOVED, yet we still met people that were not happy. Let me tell you, the bad reviews are true. We waited 4 hours to get into our hotel room, and many people from our flight waited even longer. Someone from our flight ended up taking the keys from the front desk and handing them out to us. For whatever reason, they had most of the envelopes with keys and everything on the desk, but would not hand them out to us. I believe some rooms were still not ready and they did not want to anger some people by only handing out some keys. We had two rooms total, and both had issues. One room the air conditioning was leaking onto the bathroom floor, but it worked great so we didn't bother complaining. We also found a large cockroach in this room. The other room the A/C did not work at all, and it took 2 days to get it fixed. Even after if was fixed, it barely worked and was very noisey. The food was OK. We were not able to get reservations for the restaurants until the 2nd day since the reservations desk closes at 3PM, well after we finally were checked into our room. Luckily my mom's friend wakes up very early so we had reservations for every other day. We loved the Japanese restaurant, and most other restaurants were pretty good as well. The mexican restaurant was the worst. I was already starting to feel sick at that point, and then after a few bites of the mexican I had to go back to the room and lay down. The food at the buffet was usually pretty good. The drinks were awful. There is hardly any alcohol to choose from, unlike other all-inclusive resorts we have stayed at. Even non-alcoholic drinks are hard to come by, unless all you drink is soda. There is no orange juice (just some orange drink, like Hi-C) or any juices at all for that matter. The margaritas at this place are the worst too. The worst food was at the beach, which is the Brazilian restaurant turned into a buffet for lunch. There is a guy cooking hamburgers, but no cheese, and hot dogs that dont taste like hot dogs at all. There is pizza available by the pool available 24 hours, but that was usally pretty bad too....if you could even get some. This one spanish couple went up in front of us the one night, and litterally finished off the 4 pizzas that were sitting up there. They completely filled their plate with every piece of pizza that they could fit, not leaving any for anyone else. We finally just left after waiting 10 minutes for more pizza to come out.The staff was very rude, at least to us who didn't speak spanish very well. The spanish speaking people always received the best service, especially at the bars. it takes forever to get a drink at the bar, mainly at the pool bar. There is usually only one bartender running the whole thing and he always helps the spanish speaking people first. The waitors at the breakfast buffet were always being smart. When my mom's friend would ask for a little cream in her coffee, they would litterally get one drip in and walk away. The first time it was funny, but by the last day she finally took the carafe from him and poured it herself.The beach was gorgeous, except on the 2nd to last day there was some type of oil spill, i guess from one of the many boats that fly past all day, and it had made its way up the beach. I saw it when i first went in the water, and stayed away from it, but later forgot about it and it got all over me. It smelled awful. Another couple we met complained about the same thing that day. Also the vendors parading the beach make it hard to enjoy. They will stand right in front of you rambling on about whatever and won't leave you alone. There was one vendor that kept shouting at the top of his lungs for parasailing. Imagine someone standing right in front of you, shouting for the whole beach to hear.One nice thing about our vacation was that we met some very nice people. We met some people from our own area, as well as a family from Michigan and a nice couple our own age from Canada. We even met a nice couple from Germany, and few people from Italy. After reading the reviews I was surprised how many english-speaking people we met. By far the highlight of the trip was that i won $170 from the resort's casino....at least it made me feel a little better about the trip. All said and done, i will never stay at a Barcelo resort again, and most likely will not return to the Dominican Republic either. We had a much better time in Mexico.I complained to the waiter and then to the manager, but the intensity of rudeness from them just went up.My husband, an Italian citizen, and I travel to Italy several times a year for business and pleasure, so we are very experienced in staying in hotels throughout Italy - from basic to superior. Plus every summer we take groups of soccer players and their families to Italy. All I can say is... thank god we didn't take one of our groups to this hotel - or we might be out of business! Luckily, we were only there one night with our 3 children before our return flight to the US after a 5-week stay in Italy. Though the rates were low, I would have been willing to pay double the price somewhere else just to have a clean room! It is NOT worthy of any 4- star rating – more like 2 stars. This was the first time in my many years of travel that I have ever taken photos of a hotel to post online and the only reason we did was to show we weren't kidding. We just couldn't believe how our stay deteriorated at every turn - even our kids felt the same. The only positive thing was the hotel restaurant - the food we had at dinner was surprisingly good. I am very familiar with the lovely city of Rome (all my grandparents were from there) but this area is really ugly. The hotel is in a very unpleasant area with graffiti on every building. You can see samples of that in the photos posted by others here. There are no nice places to walk to - and you wouldn't want to venture out in this neighborhood at any time. The hotel does have a shuttle bus to Rome - that's about the only convenience. The photos on the hotel website are very misleading as is the description of the “relaxing” Olympic size pool. First - the pool isn't Olympic sized and it isn't managed by the hotel, nor is the environment clean or relaxing, rather it's a community pool PACKED with people from the neighborhood - for which you pay 5.50 euro per person per day (with mandatory swim cap). The pool was dirty, not a lounge chair in sight, and the small deck areas were crammed with people - loud music blaring and people shouting, lots of cigarette smoking. The "bar" area of the pool was run by some rude kid who despite my speaking fluent Italian acted as though he didn't know what I meant when I asked to purchase the mandatory swim cap. He also refused to make change for a 10 euro note when my daughter wanted to buy 2 ice creams.. Absolutely ridiculous. You definitely would not want to bring any business group to this pool. Also, the hotel doesn’t let you pay at the front desk for pool usage. You have to deal with people at the pool – who don’t let you charge anything to your room – there is no true linkage between the pool and the hotel/ However, our greatest concern was inside of the hotel. We had 2 rooms for our family so it wasn't just a case of a one room problem. The first room my husband and I were given reeked of vomit the minute we opened the door and the carpet was filthy as were the walls. When the porter arrived to check the room, he had to step back into the hallway when he opened the door because the stench was so bad. He immediately ripped off the bed covers and threw them in the hallway. I was shocked that any cleaning staff would have even made up a room with such odor and NOT reported it to the management. Then again looking at the filth in halls and balconies – clearly the cleaning staff could care less. Speaking of management - no apologies from them about the vomit stench! When they gave us another room, we soon noticed the bedroom carpet was filthy with stains, the lamp shade had stains, and the walls had peeling wallpaper, and holes. The bathroom had mold, the base of the sink faucets leaked when turned on, the shower head kept falling down. Same scene in our children's room only they had the added pleasure of a balcony filled with cigarette butts. The hallway on our floor had dirty carpet and walls badly marked up. It looked like the halls hadn't been vacuumed in ages. I checked other floors thinking the halls might be dirty just on our floor but saw the same situation elsewhere. Also, no minibar in rooms – just vending machine in hallways (that ate our euro without dispensing the snacks – why was I not surprised? LOL) The bedroom doors are very thin and the windows not soundproofed so you'll also have the pleasure of being awakened by the student groups that I have learned, too late, frequent the place and party at all hours. Our youngest child woke up the next morning with large bug bites on her arms – which didn’t surprise anyone. Our kids are hardly picky about hotel conditions but they didn’t even want to get in those beds! See the photos to believe the facts. Stay away from this place. If If you have a tight budget, remember, there are plenty of reasonably priced lovely, clean B&Bs and small hotels right in the center of Rome!This was our second stay with Circus Circus – despite remembering not a great stay the time before, we thought this would be more kid friendly for our two young kids, as we were passing through. We were supposed to be in town for only a day, but our car had trouble, so we ended up staying longer than the one night we expected. We had so much stuff between the four of us, and with our car in the shop in a strange city, I thought moving to a better hotel would be more of a hassle than just toughing it out. VERY BAD - our non-smoking rooms reeked of cigarette smoke, and the shower curtain in one of the bathrooms was so heavily laden with smoke we had to remove it – when we did, we noticed heavy black mold under the shower curtain rings – the ceiling to the bathrooms had mold collecting and the showers were also full of black mold. The fan in the bathroom was broken. When we thought we’d only be there one night, I thought it was something I could live with, but…. The beds were worse than pull-out beds, with metal springs that poked through and hurt my knees and body – just awful. I had to layer blankets I brought from home on the beds, just to not hurt myself on the springs. There was the smell of vomit in the hallways, and the walls were so thin, we had to turn up our TV to drown out the people next door – when we turned up our TV to drown out the adjacent room and hallway sounds, security knocked on our door to tell us to turn down our TV! When we ordered pay movies, they would play for about ten minutes, and then the screen turned blue, and that was that. When I called the front desk to report it, we were told to turn the TV off and then try again. When the same thing happened, we ended up double charged for the movies. We were offered a credit for the movies over the phone, but the credit was not reflected on our bill. When I complained about that, the front desk insisted that engineering come to our room to verify the problem before giving credit, and I told them the night they said this to me that it was already too late at night and I was putting my family to bed – engineering came over anyway at almost midnight. When I complained that we didn’t receive credit back for the movies that went blank, despite engineering at our door, I was asked who told me I would get a credit, and when I couldn’t remember the name, was essentially accused of lying, and treated pretty badly. We had two adjoining rooms, and the hotel applies a $59 deposit to each room for incidentals. When we returned to our room at night after dinner, security was there and locked us out of one room, but not the other, saying we didn’t have anymore credit left on one of the rooms because of the movies that were ordered and calls made, and we had to go to the lobby at 11 PM at night to put down another deposit, even thought the other room still had the full portion of unused credit, and we were never credited back for the movies that didn’t work. When I said we never made calls, I was told they charged a mandatory fee per day for local calls, whether you make calls or not. The next morning, we spent over an hour being passed around to different people, trying to get the movie charges reversed and the problems rectified, and someone eventually, reluctantly gave in. The refrigerator froze our food. The internet is $10 for 15 minutes, and in a hole- in- the-wall room, with a really rude attendant. I went to use the internet there to try and find another place to stay, and a rental car, but after my 15 minutes were over, again thought the hassle of moving would do more harm than good, thinking we would only be there one more night and could get through it. When we needed to rent a car, the Dollar Car Rental at the hotel said they had one car left, which was tiny and with crank down windows, for which they charged us almost $100 per day, and told us there would be both an early return fee if we brought it back early as well as their late return fee! They said if there was any accident that we not only would be responsible for the repairs, but would also have to keep renting the car everyday until it was fixed. Luckily, I only keep that car one day with no accident, and then after using the internet for another $10-15 minutes, found another car from Enterprise – a real car – for $30 per day with no early return fee! When we found we had to stay longer until our car was repaired, the front desk wanted to jack up the price to almost double what we had originally paid – when I went to the supervisor, Manish, he was very nice and agreed to renew our stay at the originally quoted price – he was the only person at the hotel who seemed to care and was really nice – everyone else treated us like criminals. We ate at the buffet once – over $50 for lunch for a family of 4 - while some of the desserts were pretty good and the salad bar was fresh, most of the main dishes were really bad, and I spit out several things into my napkin because they were that awful. They did have a really nice area for the KOA campground folks next to the hotel, which I found while looking to do some laundry. The KOA campground facilities were better than the facilities for regular hotel guests!!! Although I never camped before, I was wishing I was there instead of the actual hotel. Even though the KOA facilities were nice, the laundry room left some of my clothes in worse condition than before I washed them, and I ended up rewashing by hand some of our clothes back at the room. While I am sure the room would be passable for a one night, no expectations stay, there were just too many issues and problems for me to ever recommend the hotel to others, or ever plan on returning again.My family and I stayed at this hotel last May 2011. My dad said that he decided to splurge on a hotel since we were going to be staying for a while. Considering how much this hotel charged us, the experience had been absolutely horrendous. The hotel's location is convenient. It's like two somersaults away from Ferrer Park station so the taxi driver was able to locate it easily enough and the hotel has space to accommodate cars so it wasn't a hassle unloading our baggage. Across the street is a shopping mall and there are always taxis passing the area. The hotel lobby looks nice from the outside but small on the inside. There's a patio with vending machines in front where you can hang out or eat take away if you wanted. The hotel itself has a dining area in the basement where you can get free breakfast (they serve Indian food, just a heads-up for those who aren't fans). They have an elevator and an area where you can store your baggage if you can't check in yet or if you need to check out early. So, we're done with the good stuff; onward to the bad stuff. When we got to the lobby, we were drenched to the bone because it had been raining so hard. The receptionist (who looked fairly young) was eyeing us like we were messing up her precious lobby. She was unfriendly and dismissive. When we asked about activities we could do (we were told online that we could ask about tours and destinations ), she just stared at me and told me to get flyers. Plan your itinerary already because they aren't going to help you. We didn't even get a "welcome" or "enjoy your stay". We got a room on the 4th floor if I can recall correctly. The elevator is small, cramped, and rickety. It also smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. When we got to the room, we were so disappointed because they looked nothing like the pictures.. The carpeted floor felt like it hadn't been vacuumed in ages, and the room smelled old and damp. The beds that they said could accommodate 4 were only for 3 people, even with the beds pushed together. The beds were also dirty (we had to brush off particles from the bedspread). The room was dusty, and small, and the AC stopped working properly after the first night. We woke up on the second day to find that our things were drenched from water dripping from the AC. They ignored our request to be transferred and didn't fix the AC after we reported it. We had to stash our things to one side of the room and catch the dripping water with a waste basket that would overflow. Room service sucks because they don't come at all when you call, and you actually have to take a trip to the lobby because our room phone was broken. The bathroom was super narrow, smelly, and disgusting. I never once stepped into that bathroom without slippers on because the floors were grimy. There is no floor partition for the shower area and the toilet, so everything gets drenched when you take a bath (no bathtubs either, if you're a fan of those). The separating door was stuck so we had to take a shower very carefully or else our things would get wet. At least the heater worked, but the water pressure was so weak and temperamental. No bathroom tissue or bidets, though thankfully the flush worked. The sink was gross and the tap hardly worked. No rods for placing wet towels nor baskets for placing bath things, just a broken shelf by the sink, and a metal shelf above the toilet that was covered in something grimy. No free shampoos or anything. No adapters, no internet (they said online that they had wi-fi, but they just had this one dinosaur of a computer that you could use for 2 SGD an hour). Breakfast is at 8 am, and I suggest you go early because there are a lot of people staying at the hotel and the basement dining area isn't big enough to seat everyone. The buffet's pretty decent and someone always comes out to refill the containers so the food never runs out, but they don't offer many selections (as previously said, only about three kinds of Indian food and some toast). They have juice and hot water is available if you want tea or coffee. The free breakfast was my favorite part of my stay here because my family and I were always able to eat a heavy breakfast before heading out. The baggage storage is terrible. It's just like a room with all sorts of things dumped in there (like broken chairs and broken frames) along with people's luggage. The room isn't even locked and anyone has access to it. You have to figure out how to fit your bags in with everyone else's because people literally just dump their things on top of one another's and then leave. Bag locks are your friends. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone, ever. If I could rate Claremont any lower than 1, I totally would.Three stars??? I really can't see how it got any at all, never mind three. Even describing this establishment as a hotel is stretching the English language beyond its limit and certainly does no justice to all those REAL hotels out there. Stayed here over three nights last month - myself, my wife and our three children (two of them teenagers). I waited a couple of weeks before writing this review because I needed that time to cool down a bit before writing. We booked this place directly with the hotel because it was unclear whether they would accommodate 5 people in a family room. We were assured verbally on the phone that 5 people would not be a problem. Well it wasn't a problem until we got there and tried to check in - we almost had to beg to get them to put an extra bed in the room. Ahhh... the room!!! What a horrible smelly hole in the ground of a room it was. Even without the extra bed in there, you could hardly walk around the beds, though in hindsight, perhaps this was a blessing insofar as it minimized contact with the dirty, dreary carpet on the floor. We were only staying three days so we didn't have too much luggage with us but we still had to "live out of our suitcases" - there was not enough space/storage to facilitate complete unpacking of our one suitcase and a few small bags! This was a disappointing start to our city break. Never mind - we'll go out, get something to eat, walk the streets of London and we won't have to be back here 'til late. Well, we got back later that night and decided to go to the bar to get some quick snacks and drinks. Now, where could they possibly have put it? Aw no, No bar, No restaurant, No Snacks - Nothing! Back to our little hole in the ground - we squinted as we tried to watch a tiny 14-inch TV with only about 5 TV Stations to choose from. The beds were reasonably comfortable and the sheets were clean, but the blankets didn't smell too fresh. We were woken bright and early next morning by the staff starting their work shift just before 0700. They made quite a loud racket pushing containers and vacuum cleaners around and chatting and laughing so loudly. This turned out to be a daily ritual, and each day it continued for well over an hour. Did I mention the en suite bathroom? Indeed, we had a toilet and shower en-suite, but if you didn't enter the en suite at the correct angle, turning around or manoevering after you were in there was really quite difficult (and I'm not a large person at a mere 176cm/74kg). Oh yes, the shower... the wimpy little dribbly trickle of water that emanated from the shower-head was really quite pathetic - but apart from the discomfort factor of limited water and space, all of us taking a shower took probably three or four times longer than it should have, thereby wasting our valuable sightseeing time. There wasn't even room in there for a shelf over the wash-hand basin on which to keep toothbrushes, razor, etc - they were safely packed back into our bags after each use!! It's breakfast time - We made our way to the breakfast room. One of the walls had a floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall fish tank - this was really gross - the fish were large and ugly; fighting among themselves over bits of gunk in the water, and the tank's murky water looked like it could have come from the Thames itself!. Anyway, we're all very hungry and continental breakfast is complimentary. Well, when I saw it I knew why! The coffee was not freshly brewed - more like a cheap instant coffee from the 70's; the toast was cold and limp and rubbery - so rubbery in fact that I could not bite through it without gnashing. Some bits of "meat" and cheese on a plate were also provided but these too proved to be completely inedible to us. Looking through to the kitchens, I could see a team of people washing dishes in the large sink and drying them - manually!! They didn't even have a dishwasher. By the way, there's a Garfunkels just down the road - they do proper, tasty food and service with a smile. Incidentally, this so-called hotel has no pool, no leisure facilities, no lounge, no security on the baggage room (they lend you the key and you have unmonitored, unaccompanied access to everyone's bags!) no air-conditioning, no shampoo or shower gel in the bathroom (they did provide toilet paper though), no porter to assist with bags, the slowest elevator in the world (I used the stairs with my bags after waiting for 5 minutes), and absolutely nothing to recommend it. I will not darken their door with my presence ever again - not if I was paid to. Frankly, a park bench in nearby Hyde Park is more appealing. If visiting London means you have to stay here; just stay at home - it's simply not worth it.Let me start by saying that I've written a lengthy report of our experience if you are interested, but if you are one of those who prefers a shorter review.... This hotel was awful. As I've detailed below, the rooms are old and have obviously not been checked for quality (see below), only some contain the "Sleep Number" beds that Radisson boasts, the management is horrible and treats you as though "you should be lucky we let you stay here" attitude if you book on sites such as Priceline, and is an overall terrible experience. I am not one of those that looks for much out of a hotel besides a comfortable bed, good service, and cleanliness, but this hotel does not have any of them! Our first image of the hotel was an extraordinarily busy lobby (about 2:00pm on a Thursday) with only one guest service attendant. After a short wait (totally unacceptable for a desk that could accommodate 3-4 GS Reps) we were called over to a small desk by an Asian female who we were later told was a manager on duty. She checked us in silently accept to ask for my ID and credit card. I jokingly said that is was my birthday so please make sure I have a great room to which she responded with a sarcastic (ha ha) and kept silently about her business. My partner and I were lifelessly directed to the elevators and entered a very small room that had 1 very small double bed when the reservation was made for two people. I called down to ask about changing to a larger room. The phone was answered by the same lifeless personality that checked us in, and after expressing my issue, she asked for my room number and what my room number was and that she would return my call momentarily. During the next ten minutes we looked around the room only to find paint peeling from the ceiling and a not so pleasant smell. After my call went un-returned (10 minutes later) I called the desk, was answered by the same lifeless personality and was told I would again be given a call back - all with no answer to my complaint. This time the call was returned after about 2 minutes. I was told that because I booked through Priceline, I automatically got the smallest room despite my reservation being for two. However, she would, "as a courtesy", upgrade the room if there was something available. After two more five minute waits I was told that all larger beds were sold out for the evening but to check back later that night. Having worked in the hotel industry before an knowing that this is a common falsity I checked the Radisson websites availability for the evening an low and behold it had queens and kings available. My partner asked to speak with the general manager , and explained not only our issue about the room, but also the fact that we were lied to. This gentlemen (which I will identify as being of Middle Eastern or Indian decent) apologized for the lie by saying that previous manager only had limited access to the hotel's availability and that's was the reason for the inconsistency. Instead of handling the remainder of the issue himself, he stood by while he had a gentlemen he introduce as his "assistant" checked availability (he did however step in to say that if he was given the opportunity to make money off of us he would do what he could) and then once larger rooms were found he offered to upgrade the room for a fee! We explained the previous offer for a courtesy upgrade and he replied that he didn't know why she would offer this and that he would need to call her. At this point he disappeared into a back room. His assistant Michael followed him and returned saying that he would process our courtesy upgrade. We were then told to leave our original keys in the room after "moving our things as soon as possible." Upon exiting the original room, a housekeeper in the hall asked if we had "messed anything up in the room" with the connotation that she did not want to go in and clean it. He apologized and stated that the only room he had available to upgrade us to was on the noisiest level of the hotel. We accepted and were sent to a room that had a foul odor and a 5 inch square hole in the wall's vent paneling that blocked the electrical system. ( Prime exposure for bugs, rats dust, etc.) As if that were not bad enough we the ledge outside was covered with cigarette butts! We of course felt uncomfortable in this room and notified the manager again by phone, and were told to wait so he could come down and see what I was talking about. After another 10 minute wait we went upstairs to find him sitting at the desk talking to other guests. He changed the room to another on the same level which, as I tried to enter, was blocked by the housekeeper's closet left open with a broom. After she closed the door, we entered the room to be greeted by an even worse foul odor (smelled like a dumpster had been emptied), a dirty stained window, and a view cinder blocks, and loud air conditioning units. After returning to the desk, we were given a fourth room room on the hotel's top floor *which takes to elevators to get to). The room was much better with the exception of the chipped paint on the bathroom fixtures,missing handles on the dressers, broken iron, and incomplete towel set (which we had to wait about 35 minutes for to be replaced) As it was my birthday, and more than two hours after our arrival, we chose to ignore these things and kept the room. The remainder of our stay was filled with inconveniences and overheard constant complaints of others: 1. When we left and returned to our room, our keys did no longer worked and had to take 2 trips on the 2 elevator ride to the top level to get back to our room. 2. We heard several other guests complain about false charges, $100 hikes in rate to extend their stays, and one guest even expressed that his hair dryer was sparking and he felt unsafe during his stay. During checkout, that I could not wait for!! I waited about 10 minutes at the again under-manned desk, while the Middle Eastern rude manager who disappeared and never returned the day before stood and watched the slow progression of guests checking out. I was asked about my stay, and explained my problems only to be told that nothing could be done to accommodate me because I booked with Priceline, but that I should have a nice day! Do yourself a favor..never stay here!As part of the last stop on my honeymoon, my wife and I chose to stay at the Days Inn Westminster UK on 80-86 Belgrave Rd. London, England SW1V 2BJ on June 4th & 5th, 2007.. We had been to Iceland and Scotland without any problems and arrived at the Days Inn at 11:15pm. We were given the keys to room 364 and took the elevator which dropped us off on the wrong floor even though we had hit the right button. Upon entering the room we noticed it had no resemblance to the pictures we saw on the Expedia-Days inn website. In fact, the room did not even match the pictures on the brochure from the Days Inn lobby. In addition, the room smelled and the shower door was broken making difficult to enter or get out of the shower. Since it was late we decided to stick it out and stay, however lying down to sleep we noticed several small insects in the bed with wings. I tried to catch one but they would leap and were impossible to catch. Whether they were bed-bugs or flew in from the screenless window didnâ€™t really matter to us, we knew we had to leave for health reasons. In fact I had been in the bed for about 15 minutes and I sustained a bite above my ankle (I have a pic but don't want to disgust people reading this). We packed up and went to the lobby for checkout around 12:15 am. The desk clerk Smadar was very unsympathic and said that we were getting what we paid for in a 3 star hotel. I said no hotel should contain insects and asked if Smadar would stay in a room with insects if he were on vacation with his family. Still, nothing seemed to get through and I was told no refund would be given so I had him call a cab and we left at 12:15am tired and disgruntled. We ended up staying at a Marriott which cost $475 US dollars per night.(compared to the Days Inn $214 per night). Days Inn gave us a refund for 1 night but with the night they charged us for plus the Marriott, cabfare ($25 US), and calls to the Days Inn Manager ($25) we ended up spending $570 in unforeseen expenses (not to mention the hours Iâ€™ve spent calling Expedia at work and trying to get a hold of the Days Inn Manager while still in London). Regarding the Manager, Mr. Ali Rizwan, I called the following morning from a payphone (June 6th) and explained my predicament and that a full refund would be needed given the hardship, insects, and terrible shape/smell of the room. He said he would need to check with his managers and call in pest control to check the room. I called several times from the payphone in London and he kept saying he had to check with his supervisors and that the pest control folks had not found anything. Given the insects had wings they could have easily flown out of the screenless window so this didnâ€™t at all surprise me. Also, he said the pest control co. was under contract for Days Inn so finding bugs would be a conflict of interest and could result in their contract being nullified. Since I was flying home I gave Mr. Rizwan my phone # and e-mail address and he promised to contact me with his supervisors refund info. After a few days I had heard nothing which surprised me because he seemed professional when I spoke to him on the phone. Finally I called with my cell phone (Verizon charges me $1.50US per min.) and though I called during his hours (London time) I was continually told he was not there and that he would get back to me, I left my contact info. each call. Even writing this letter I have yet to hear back any info from him. Here is the call breakdown: 6/5 Called from payphone at London Marriott (10 minutes) 6/6 Called from payphone at London Marriott (10 minutes) 6/8 (arrived home) Called from home with cell phone (5 minutes) 6/12 Called from home with cell phone (5 minutes) Here is their â€œguaranteeâ€�: Days Inn guarantee As our guest, you can expect warm hospitality and clean, comfortable rooms where everything works, to make your stay trouble-free and enjoyable.

I booked the trip through Expedia.com and have had even less success with their call center. Iâ€™ve called 6 times for a total of 1 hour and 40 minutes on the phone, the majority of this done at work. Each time I would be put on hold for several minutes then the rep. would try and call Mr. Rizwan to see if a refund would be issued, it was like I had to call Expedia to remind them to contact Days Inn! For the last call it took them 30 minutes to say that Days Inn would only issue a credit for 1 night and I asked to speak to a supervisor whereby I was told I would be on hold for 2 hours before getting through. It was like the rep didnâ€™t want me to talk to someone over their head and while I was on hold she kept saying that I should just accept the 1 night refund and it was a good deal, I informed her it was not acceptable and left my phone # and asked for the supervisor to call me back and I never heard a thing from them after that. Here is my call log (all calls can be backed up by my Verizon statement if requested). 6/9 14 minutes 6/10 7 minutes 6/11 9 minutes 6/11 9 minutes (called x2) 6/13 10 minutes (Reps name was Mabel) 6/14 50 minutes!

What a horrible place to vacation. The front desk personal are the worst I have ever experienced. They are rude and extreamly unaccommodating. I have witnessed the most amount of fights that I have ever seen as the employees do nothing to help their guests they lie and ridicule people to their faces. Watch out for a women named Dulce, she is awful. They try to rip you off upon check out, you are given a towel card and room card if you loss one they charge 10-20 dollars us. I had 2 room keys and 3 towel keys for my family and upon check out DULCE said that I was to return 5 towel keys and 4 room keys? She would not give me my pass to get on our bus that takes us to the airport without paying or returning the keys. I kept explaining to her that I only had 2 room card and 3 towel cards. I had to speak to someone else who was in agreement with DULCE therefore I had to pay them at total of 60 dollars us inorder to check out and make my bus. I was enraged. Also watch out for PATRICIA in the buffet of the sunset side. What a delightful face to see early each morning....NOT. What a miserable women she is. She is the head seating person and never smiles always looks to see if people are sneaking out any fruit or other food from the dining room. You are not allowed to take anything out of the dining room or they will chase you out and make a scene in front of other guests. She called security on my cousin as she took a banana out of the dining room after breakfast one day. Speaking of the buffet, the food at this hotel is at best...mediocre. The drinks are horrible. The food repeats itself day in and day out. The same desserts every meal the same everything all the time. All the desserts taste the same and most of the food looks like mush. Many people I spoke with agreed that the food was not good. This is a very large resort and if you hate walking in the heat to get to everything DO NOT COME TO THIS RESORT. The beach is very far, about a 20 minute walk from the front of the hotel. The pools are spread out everywhere. The activity pool is often full of popcorn and staws and drinks, they don't clean it until after use so you are constantly swimming around other people's food and drinks in the pool. Pretty disgusting. They name this pool the PEE POOL because people stay in this pool all day drinking and never come out to go to the washroom, pretty disgusting. The crowd that goes to this hotel are trashy type of people making it a very low rent holiday, with people budding in the lines, people falling over you at the pool bar to get their next drink while still holding a drink in the hand. Women taking thier tops off for faster services etc. Beleive me I was there for 3 weeks and saw it all. The Mexican locals come to the hotel for thier holidays each weekend from Thursday to Monday as they get very low rates and bring many family members with them. While I love Mexicans and all I do not wish to vacation with the locals at the same hotel. They are usually bused in from towns a few hours away and they overbook the hotel during these time causing limited access to beach and pool chairs, long line ups in the buffet and lack of ability to book a la carte restaurants. Friends we met there had bed bugs in their room and tryed to leave early but hotel would not understand their concerns and denied any issues. Other people we met complained that their room smelled musky and moldy and asked for a room change they had to wait 3 days and the new room had blood stains on the bed sheets and someone came to change the sheets and every set thereafter had stains of some sort. I brought my own blanket so I never went into the sheets. The plantinum hotel and lobby on the riviera side is still closed and boarded up due the devestating explosion that killed a few Canadians and some local workers back in the new year. We found a shrine in the workers area for the 2 local employees who perished in the explosion but their was nothing for the Canadians that lost their lives. The beach water is lovely however the set up on the beach is horrible. You cannot see the beach water while sitting on your chair as they have all these little store huts blocking your view, as it is a public beach they are able to rent space on the beach. The seating area on the beach is all clumped together so you feel like people are on top of you, like an ant hole. The front row of the beach are chairs for sale, you have to pay to use them. The platinum and villa guests have their own roped off area. There is only one towel service on the whole resort and they often were out of towels. People loved to steal towels as no one wanted to pay $20 for a towel card if they lost their towel or card. What a pain this was. My counsin had her i phone stolen from the gym, turned for 2 minutes and someone took it. When she told the front desk, they did not care at all. She was clearly upset and they ignored her. We have never been so glad to return from a vacation and totally regret spending it at this hotel. If you have young children and require use of a stroller you will have to carry your stroller up and down many flight sof stairs both at the main lobby and the room area. It did not look fun for these people. Not a place for anyone with a handicap, no handicapp access, just terrible planning. We met a lovely family from California with 18 month old twins, they put them on the 3rd floor and although they asked everyday for a room change they refused to give them one, they told everyone that they were at capacity however if you are willing to pay for an upgrade usually between $500- $600 dollars they miraculously have rooms available. Have been to the myan area many times and have stayed at so many wonderful hotels, they have gorgeous hotels in the the myan, make sure you invest time in your search for a holiday and STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL.Billed as a family friendly resort, we chose Paradise Point as the place to stay when we took our 3 year old to San Diego for his first family vacation. Placing our reservations a month in advance, I decided to splurge and reserve the bay view junior suite. We arrive with an exhausted, nap-ready kid at 2PM; we were told that our room was not ready yet, we're given pool keys, and told that we could visit any of the resort's pools while we wait. I ask for our room # so that I we could park and visit the pool closest to our room... we're told that they could not disclose our room #. Huh? Things got worse from there. At 3:30, we were given the go ahead to check in. We picked up our room keys, opened the door, and discovered that we had been given a garden view suite, not the bay view I had reserved. Strike 2. Going to the front desk and requesting a new room at this point is untenable...our child is exhausted...we decide to speak with the front desk the next day. That night, after the boy went to sleep, my wife and I decide to enjoy a glass of wine and some quiet time. We discover that we're not alone...another tenant, a 2 inch long cockroach is sauntering across the floor. This roach was so big, that I could have either smashed him with a shoe or put a leash around him...he does go very well with the three spiders in the ceiling. Strike 3. The roach successfully dispatched, our wine drank, we decide to call it a night...did I mention that we had to go to the store to buy plastic cups to drink our wine because the wet bar in our suite had no cups, no plates, no silverware, nothing? We crawl into bed and discover a blood stain on our duvet. It's not an OJ Simpson sized blood stain, but large enough that the maid should have caught it...we feel the benefit of the doubt slowly shrinking away. Morning. Surprised the coffee maker works, I have my morning cup and climb into the shower. When I get out, I reach for a towel to dry myself only to discover that it is as soft as a roofing tile. Seriously some free beach towels we got at dodger stadium that we use to dry our dog are soft as silk compared with ones. After a big day we return during naptime (1:30 PM) only to discover that the maid hasn't made up our room yet...so, off to the pool we go while we wait for housekeeping. Strike #?? I've lost count. My lovely bride stays with the boy (and her cocktail) at the pool while I visit the front desk to discuss my first day at PP. The guy at the front desk promises the maid will be earlier tomorrow, to report the insect infestation, and that the OJ duvet will be replaced. And the bayview room? He tells me that we got a free UPGRADE from a Bayview Junior Suite to a Garden View Suite. How thoughtful. It would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted this generous upgrade. Day 3. The towels are still exfoliating me, housekeeping had finished by the time we returned from Seaworld, and no signs of any other 6 or 8 leg co-tenants...maybe they're turning this thing around? Fat chance. That night we ordered an early dinner so we would have time to make smores at the fire pit in the main pool area with our son. We arrive at the fire pit at 7:30 PM. No fire. A couple sitting nearby tell us that they have already put in a request to have the fire lit. Not taking any chances I go to the front desk. The woman behind the desk tells me that she'll "put in a request for the service." When I ask her what that means, she tells me that she punches in the request in the computer which will cause someone to show up "soon." Not very reassuring. 7:45 PM. No fire. I return to the front desk. This time there are three parties ahead of me checking in. The woman at the front desk knows why I'm there, but she pretends she doesn't see me to make me wait. When I get to the front of the line, she explains that she doesn't know why the fire hasn't been lit yet. I suggest, impatiently, that perhaps she should pick up the phone and call someone. Her manager beckons me, promises she'll have someone there right away. 8:15 PM. Still no fire. My son is doing his best at waiting patiently for smores. I am no longer patient. So I bring him and his marshmallow laden stick to the front desk. The women there still have no answer for the delay, and seemingly no empathy for my problem. Exasperated, on my way out, I tell them to "light the damn fire pit." The manager behind the front desk threatens to evict me. Unreal. 8:30 PM. We talk with a security guard walking through the main pool area. He gets on his radio. The fire pit is lit within five minutes. Was that so hard? 10:00 PM. We decide to crawl into bed for our final night at the hotel. We pull down the sheets and see the familiar blood stain on the bedspread. Well, I guess I cannot complain lest my evicted family has to spend the night in our car.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Lousy Service at Horizon Club, Poor Value for Money The Horizon Club Rooms ( ie executive floor rooms of Shangri-La Group) in the Kowloon Shangri-La were recently advertised as newly renovated and refurbish, and being quite confident of Shangr-la's standard, and having stayed in their standard room before, I decided to try. So I booked a Horizon Harbour View Club Room which include Horizon Lounge access. I soon come to seriously regret this. First impression when I arrived was already poor. I reached the hotel at 1pm and was informed that my room was not ready since the hotel had full occupancy. I was informed that it will take another hour. Granted the hotel official check-in time is 2PM so I went somewhere else and return one hour later and to my dismay, my room was still not ready. The check-in staff at the Horizon Club made a half-hearted apology and asked me to wait at the lounge while she chased the housekeeping staff to tidy up the room. Finally, the room was ready at 3:30pm. As I paid a top-tier rate for this room in the same range as what I have paid recently for the Four Seasons Hong Kong, I expected to be impressed by it. I was not. The room's decor is the very standard 5-star hotel room, ie carpeted, marble bathroom, slightly larger then normal, working desk, king-bed, the standard stuff. It's all very dull and plain. Furniture and fixtures looks new and functional though but again boring design. They advertise the room as having flat screen TV and surround sound. Well, the TV looks cheap and is only 32 (compare to the usual 42 flatscreen plasma found in most modern hotels). The surround sound is a joke, as the sound comes from a cheap home-theater in-a-box type of setup with such poor sound quality from the small speakers that you might as well just listen to the sound from the TV speakers. For the price they are charging, one should reasonably expect the hotel to invest in a proper sound system if they really want to implement this feature and not put up a gimmick. Next, the poorest aspect of my room, the bathroom. First, you notice the extra-small bath-tub when you step in. Even though I am just an average build asian, I have problem fitting inside it. Then the shower cubicle only have a overhead shower nozzle but no shower stick, highly inconvenient. And worst part is that this bathroom is no different from the bathroom avaliable in standard rooms at a much lower price. Compare that to the luxurious and well equipped bathroom of the Four Seasons, it is simply no comparison. Not everything is bad though. There are some good aspects of this room. The view is reasonably good and there are conveniences in the room such as a Ipod station for playing songs and charging your Ipod and a fax machine/printer. Internet speed is reasonably fast and the sofa chairs are quite comfortable. Well, since the room is only so-so, I thought maybe the lounge will be better. Another big dissapointment. I think the so called lounge area is simply 3 or 4 bedrooms knocked down to form a single room. So the design is longish and worse, they crammed three rows of table across the width of the hallway so there is barely any space left to skretch your legs. Because of the space constraint, during breakfast, there is not enough space to lay out the food presentation so most of the items like eggs, sausages, pancakes etc are in a separate menu which has to be ordered to the kitchen. As a result, the staff at the Horizon lounge wasted a lot of time running in and out of the kitchen area to collect the dishes. Food selection during cock-tail is poor, with only very limited variety. And during evening, because of the small size and close proximity with other tables, it became very crowded and noisy during the evening and lacking privacy. I have seen better and much more spacious executive lounges in other hotels. Even the Shangri-La in Jakarta is better. This lounge looks distinctly four star. The worst aspect of my stay is the service attitude of the Horizon lounge staff. Unlike the Four Seasons where I was greeted warmly by name everywhere I go, I stayed 2 days in the Kowloon Shangri-La and often drop by at the club lounge for drinks and not once was I welcome or greeted by the staff on duty, and of course they can't remember my name. They simply ignore me until I call upon them when I needed something, then they were inconveniently made aware of my existence. But I noticed they were very quick to greet and service the other guests who are caucasians ( ie westerners ). I am very annoyed by this kind of attitude and bias treatment, as if my money is not good enough for them. And it is not just me, I noticed another lady hotel guest who is a asian lady also had problem getting any attention during one of the breakfast session. Not all the staff service attitude are bad. The housekeeping, reception and conciege staff are reasonably good and responsive as expected of a 5-star hotel, but again nothing special or outstanding.It goes without saying that they did not bother to ask me how was my stay when I checked-up. Overall, this hotel is fine if you stay in a standard room and pay under USD250/= which is about the standard rate for a 5-star hotel in Hong Kong and you do not have high expectation. But the Horizon Club room rate is more than double that and at this price, it makes a extremely poor value considering the poor room and lounge facilities and what other 5-star hotels in Hong Kong can offer. Couple that with the indifferent service attitude of the staff at the Horizon floor, especially if you are asian like me, it is best to avoid this hotel completely. How others can rate this hotel as excellent is beyond me, they have certainly not experienced a truely luxurious 5-star hotel or have very low expectations. I will probably not stayed in this hotel again, esp the club rooms. It is just short of being a rip-off for the price.Host and Hostess was quite rude.All I have to say about this hotel is WOW!!! Please do not get the wrong idea. I am in no way using the word WOW to describe how great my experience was, but rather to let EVERY SINGLE PERSON reading reviews on trip advisor to know how disgusted I am from this hotel. From the second we stepped foot through the doors to the third floor, we were welcomed by the sound of a screeching fire alarm asking us to evacuate the building. Lorna the lady at the concierge desk did not even look up to acknowledge the fact that we were there. I was the one who said hello, and received a rude hello back. No mention whatsoever about if we were to evacuate or not. In any case, she proceeded to check us in without one word about what to expect, where to go, or what amenities we had access to! She literally said NOTHING!!! To top it all off, she continued to have a full on conversation with another employee while we checked in. Since it was my first time in Miami, I was hoping to get some pointers as far as what we can do, but I got nothing. She didnt tell us about the spa, pool or anything that we can expect to see. When I first booked this room, I called in 4 different times asking about certain things before I actually booked my room. I had 3 main things I wanted to have on my trip. I wanted to be in front of a beach, have a balcony to enjoy the view of the water and the sounds of waves, and I wanted to be close to South Beach!! Well I was lied to about the fact that my room would have an ocean view, and I was about 10 minutes ($25) cab ride each way to South Beach!! Had I known I was going to spend this much money on cabs, I would have rather booked a $500 a night room that would have given me everything I wanted, not lied to me, and given me the service that 4 or 5 star hotels are supposed to give their guests. One other thing that pissed me off to know end was the fact that the hotel told me upon booking that they would charge a $100 deposit as soon as i booked the room, and charged the rest 24 hours before I got there. Well they charged the full amount about 5 days before I got there. Therefore, even if I wanted to switch hotels, I would not have been able to. When I told LORNA about this, she told me that i was wrong. I told her to check it before she talks and I was right. I was not compensated for this, nor was I given an apology!!! THEY DID NOTHING!!! Then I was told that they would be charging me $100 more per night as a deposit. Although, deposits are standard for hotel check in, $400 seemed high and they had not told me about this. When I said something, they said that its hotel policy and that its written in my reservation contract. I told them well it was also written that I was to be charged 24 hours before I get there and yet that wasn't the case. They did not say anything except shrug. I asked for a high floor at least and they said that they were all booked. Funny thing because i might have seen a total of 2 guest s the entire time I was there. All of this happened within the first 10 minutes of arriving. As you can tell, they left a bad taste in my mouth. The hotel has one employee doing the job of four different positions. Room service, housekeeping, concierge, and front desk are all run by one person at a time. Because of this, the calls often went to voicemail. LORNA was extremely rude throughout the entire time I was there. Not once was I treated like a paying guest! I asked for advil one night when it says the hotel offers it, and I was told to walk to the gas station and get it myself. We called the front desk so that they can call a cab. Thirty minutes later when we were ready to go out, they called us and told us that they called around and every taxi driver told them that it would be about 30 minutes to arrive so she didn't order it. Then she proceeded to tell us that we should just hail a cab. We are 3 young girls stuck in a remote area because we were lied to and we were told to hail a cab! I just could not believe what I was hearing. Every morning we ordered coffee and it was COLD! We asked for drinks at the pool and the person working told me that his shift was over. This was around 5, but the pool closes at 7! I asked about the manager of the hotel and they told me that it was Ryan Stone and that he would not be in until Monday. I wanted to wait to complain because I did not want to talk to an assistant. I expressed my anger to another employee and she was really nice (Kelly). I thought that Ryan would be more compassionate and help me deal with this. Instead he was condescending and was no help at all. I told him that my entire experience of Miami had been ruined because of the staffs service and the fact that the hotel was not what they told us it would be. My entire vacation was ruined because of this hotel. For me, my hotel is one of the most important things that I look for t make sure that its everything i want. I was lied to in many ways and i am very unhappy about that. I expressed every single concern that i just mentioned above and he asked me what i wanted. I told him that I wanted to be compensated for at least a night or two and he told me that he didn't think what i was complaining about warranted that. I asked him what he thought would warrant that request and he said that if the hotel promised something and didn't deliver. Is it just me, or was he just not listening to what I was saying. After fighting for a long time, he took off $100. Really?? What is $100 after my awful experience. I despised this hotel and it made me unhappy the entire time I was in Miami. The service and staff were very unpleasant and I am very disappointed in the treatment that i received from each and everyone there with the exception of Kelly and Addie. I really don't understand who employs these people and why the staff feels like they are gods gift to the world. I spent so much money on cabs. I could have booked a much better room that was on the beach and close to everything and paid the exact same. Instead I chose this one because they LIED to me.. Please don't go here because you will be miserable.. I travel a lot and I have never complained about anywhere that i have stayed. I have stayed in places that have not been to my liking, but the staff at these places helped to make t better. This was just an all around experience. I never write reviews but this was not going to get slipped through. Everyone needs to know what type of circus these people are running at the hotel TEMPO!!! I am furious and I still cant get over it! DONT EVERY STAY HERE! I will never stay at another Rock Resort in my entire life and I will make sure that nobody i know ever stays there either!!Not as Healthy as I had Hoped.I wrote a review of this product detailing my own experience with this product and coconut oil in general. It generated a good discussion spanning 97 comments, however it was not very concise and I wished I had made my points more clearly. This is a rewrite of my initial review.<br /><br />I purchased this product because I had heard stories in the popular media about how coconut oil contains a healthy form of saturated fat. I welcomed this news because coconut oil is a fun ingredient. It has a high smoke point, a great taste, and does not go rancid.<br /><br />As a chemist, the hypothesis for why it may be healthier made sense to me. Coconut oil contains medium chain saturated fats, which differ from the long chain saturated fats found in red meat. I studied lipid transport during my PhD and I think it is totally possible the body does different things with these two different chemicals.<br /><br />However it is also totally possible that the two types of saturated fat both increase one's risk of cardiovascular disease. To figure this out, I looked through the literature and spoke with people to see what proof there was.<br /><br />What I found was that the arguments that suggest medium chain saturated fats are health appeared flawed to me. Here are the arguments I have heard:<br /><br />Some people reference studies of island dwelling-people who eat diets rich in coconut fats. These people have low rates of heart disease. The problems with these studies are significant. First, these people often die earlier than Westerners, and that is why they have lower cardiovascular disease. They have lower rates of Alzheimer's disease too. This is because of the second, larger problem: there are MANY things about the life of an island-dwelling person that is different than that of a Westerner. Maybe the diet is the cause of an observed effect, maybe it is the increased exercise or different sleep pattern. You just can't draw conclusions when so many variables have changed. Islanders are just too different to use as a model.<br /><br />Some people trust books written about the subject like "The Coconut Oil Miracle" or "The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil". The problem with these books is that they are books, not studies. To prove something, you have to perform a study. To make their arguments, they often cite studies, but the studies are like the one above, typically flawed. There isn't a paper published that shows medium chain saturated fats do not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease the way saturated fats do.<br /><br />There have also been citations from doctors such as Dr. Mercola. It is best to take advice from leaders in the field, rather than doctors trying to sell a book or treatement. Specifically Dr. Mercola has been admonished by the FDA for making misleading claims:  [...] Be careful who you trust.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is no evidence that medium chain saturated fats have different health effects than saturated fats. The most convincing argument in favor of coconut oil is that saturated fats themselves are not dangerous. There is controversy on this subject (just like with most medical subjects) but the vast majority of the data supports the idea that saturated fat increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. To support this, here are some sources.<br /><br />1) Harvard University School of Public Health published this easy guide to fats and cholesterol:<br />[...]<br />Here they recommend that you should not decrease fat intake overall, just replace saturated fats with unsaturated, the less saturated the better.<br />2) The most convincing paper on this subject says this:<br />"Based on consistent evidence from human studies, replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat modestly lowers coronary heart disease risk, with ~10% risk reduction for a 5% energy substitution; whereas replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate has no benefit and replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated fat has uncertain effects. "<br /> To restate this, if you replace saturated fat with polysaturated fat, you will reduce your risk of heard disease. The authors say a 10% risk reduction is modest, but consider that you are most likely to die for a heart attack so a 10% risk reduction is quite welcome in my opinion.<br />Further research has shown "The meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%." That is a huge effect.<br />Citation is here:<br />Lipids. 2010 Oct;45(10):893-905. Epub 2010 Mar 31.<br />Saturated fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes: a fresh look at the evidence.<br />Micha R, Mozaffarian D.<br />Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA.<br />3) Finally here is a list of all the studies done on the subject, what you will find is that, while the topic is controversial, it is not a 50/50 toss-up. The majority of studies find saturated fat to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.<br />[...]<br /><br />To summarize what I learned from these conversations and articles, I now know that there is no proof that medium chain saturated fats behave differently than long chain saturated fats, and I know saturated fats likely increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as much as 19%.<br /><br />I decided to take the more conservative path and I sold the coconut oil I bought, hopefully to someone who plans on using it in some other way besides eating it. I hope to realize the health benefits associated with replacing saturated fats in my diet with polyunsaturated fats.When we checked in, we didnâ€™t get much information. We were only given our room-number and were told that only continental breakfast was included in the room-price. English breakfast was only available with an upgrade of 4,5 pounds per person per day. First thing we noticed was that it is a VERY big hotel... loads of people staying there. When we got to our room, at the end of a loooong corridor, we had to use our keycards about 6 or 7 times before the door opened. The room was clean but very small. Bathroom even smaller. I sat down on the corner of the bed to take off my shoes, when the bed collapsed... the leg had gone off the bed and screws were lying on the floor under the bed. We went downstairs to the reception and told them about the bed. They said theyâ€™d be sending maintenance. Went to our room again and after 10 minutes 2 guys came to check the bed. â€œHmm the leg seems broken, donâ€™t know if itâ€™s only the screws or something worse. We have two options: we can put sheets under the bed instead of the leg, and tomorrow we can try to fix it or we can give you the only room we have left, which doesnâ€™t have warm water. In that case you could use the new room for sleeping and the old room for showering until bed is fixed.â€� We chose the other room. They had someone coming to our room with new keycards. When we entered the new room, we could hear water leaking. We checked the bathroom and there was a big puddle on the floor and the shower was leaking... not dripping, no, really leaking. It was so noisy that we were sure we wouldnâ€™t be able to sleep. We returned to our room and called reception... they didnâ€™t pick up. We tried a second time and they didnâ€™t pick up. We called concierge explained our problem and he transferred us to reception again... nobody picked up the phone. After a few minutes I called reception again. This time they answered and after me telling them our problems, they said they tell the manager. 10 minutes later a guy knocked at our door with a new keycard for a third room. There was no hot water in that either but we could also keep our initial room. We went to the room and when we wanted to go to bed we noticed that the mattress was very small. In fact it was almost 20 cm smaller than the bed. We decided to sleep in it anyway but it was so small we couldnâ€™t turn around without fearing falling out of the bed. The next morning we went to the reception again to remind them to fix our bed. Then we went to the Carvery restaurant and opted for English breakfast by paying 9 pound for the both of us (upgrade). We were very disappointed by the buffet. They had eggs, sausages, bacon, 1 plate with cooked ham, one plate with one kind of slices of cheese, some fruit that was not fresh, very soft (old) croissants, quite hard rolls (quite stale) some cereals and that was about it. It didnâ€™t taste great at all. We decided to try the continental breakfast the next day, since that was included in our room price. When we came back in the evening the bed was fixed. One good thing. But the bed was very bad. Whenever one would move a bit the other one would just be moved up and down on the bed (it was no waterbed)â€¦ we ended up in not sleeping much because of the moving on the mattress. The next day we tried continental breakfast. That was in an other restaurant (Italian connection) and it was just a big joke. They had a â€œbuffetâ€� with one plate of sliced cheese (one kind only), which was on some spots already hard on the corners. That was their promised selection of meats and cheesesâ€¦ then they had the same stale rolls and soft croissants that we had the day before. Some cornflakes some jam, butter, rice crispies and some oranges (not fresh) and that was about it! No forks and knives available for a few minutes etcâ€¦ The next day, they had the same except that they only had half a plate of cheese, probably the day beforeâ€™s left-overs. So basically it was nothing more than a big rip-off. We can just warn all of you not to go there, because it is nothing but a big rip-off. Personnel might be mostly friendly but it seems management really just wants to make money and and they really couldnâ€™t care less about their customers. NOT to recommend at all. It ruined our stay at London. Donâ€™t go there if you want to enjoy your stay We werenâ€™t the only ones not happy with this hotel. Overheard many times how people were very dissatisfied. Pro: Friendly staff (most of them) Location Contra: Small rooms Some staff not friendly Worst breakfast ever English breakfast only with 4,5 pounds /person/day upgrade English breakfast quite bad Continental breakfast. just a joke Very bad bedsI sincerely hope this review reaches the highest levels of Cosmopolitan management. Something is severely wrong at the Cosmo and it's sad because the hotel has a lot of potential to be one of the top properties in Vegas. A planned seven week stay for a business trip at the Cosmopolitan was cut short to 17 nights. Staying one night longer was intolerable. The good and the bad and the terrible; with the good first to be fair: 1.) The Cosmopolitan has an unbeatable center Strip location right next to Bellagio. 2.) It’s new, striking and very hip. Great interior design. 3.) Excellent large room and suites done very stylishly and comfortably. Wraparound Suites are full apartments located on the corners of the building. 4.) The best Strip views of any hotel if you stay in the East Tower of the Cosmo. 5.) Food and beverage outlets on the second floor are away from the casino area. We tried them all and they are superb. The Cosmopolitan has one of the best groups of dining venues in Vegas. So the good points are very good. However, this stay was my third and final stay at the Cosmo. This year I’ve spent five weeks total as a guest in the Cosmopolitan. The hotel has some great points but the poor service negates all of the positives. I checked into the Cosmopolitan room 3793 on July 14 and checked out on August 1. During my stay I experienced some of the worst service imaginable provided by a very friendly and seemingly capable staff that just doesn't execute. Now for the bad and the terrible – it’s a long review of the bad and the terrible: Housekeeping and Maintenance: Upon check-in on July 14 into room 3793 I encountered the following housekeeping and maintenance problems: 1.) A soiled feminine hygiene product in the nightstand drawer; totally disgusting. 2.) Food from previous guests in the kitchen cupboards. 3.) Carpet so stained and filthy that it turned bare feet black. Drink stains glaringly obvious on the carpet. 4.) Hair and a sticky gooey stain on the nightstand. 5.) Burned out light bulbs in the kitchen, living room and bathroom. 6.) Filthy air conditioning filters and a room that wouldn’t properly cool. 7.) A telephone that wouldn’t work. For a hotel less than one year old the room was in a shockingly poor condition. Upon encountering the room in such a poor condition I called guest services which is called “Beck n Call” at the Cosmopolitan. After much insistence (it took three calls to Beck n Call) a housekeeping supervisor called me back. Robert, the housekeeping supervisor, was very friendly and genuinely concerned. I told him the carpet needed cleaned immediately and the room thoroughly scrubbed. Robert gave me a $50 Cosmopolitan gift card for my inconvenience due to unacceptable housekeeping issues (a laughably petty amount when taking into consideration that I was a guest with a planned seven week stay in a suite averaging $450 per night). To Robert’s credit the issues were taken care of quickly except for the carpet cleaning which took two attempts. Even after the second attempt it was still stained. Maintenance responded quickly and fixed the telephone, air conditioning and changed light bulbs. During all three of my stays at the Cosmopolitan a recurring theme occurs: the guest room is very shoddily cared for but if you DEMAND service it will be provided. However unless you are very persistent housekeeping and maintenance service is very shoddy. Daily housekeeping service was a chore. Beata, the day Floor Supervisor, is wonderful. She was the most switched on and professional employee I encountered at the Cosmopolitan. However Floor Supervisors change and when Beata wasn’t available daily housekeeping service suffered. Small things like removing the kitchen trash would be forgotten. Dirty kitchen floors went unmopped and other unacceptable sloppy housekeeping standards were common. When we encountered a good housekeeper and requested her every day she was working even this simple request couldn’t be organized by housekeeping. Noise: Noise is a huge issue at the Cosmopolitan East Tower. Even on the 37th floor the Marquee Day / Nightclub was very noisy. On Monday nights (service industry nights) the music was very loud even on the 37th floor. The noise was loud enough to prevent sleeping. If you select an East Tower room you have a lot of benefits including far better views than the West Tower. But noise from the Strip or Marquee Day / Nightclub are huge issues for East Tower rooms. Room Service Understaffed and hopeless sum up room service. 75 minute wait times for an order to be delivered? At the prices charged I expect quick delivery of food. That’s not going to happen at the Cosmo. Pools What a disaster; the Cosmo has three pools. One is the Marquee Dayclub which charges a cover and is very loud and crowded and definitely not for the over 35 crowd. The other two pools are so overcrowded that it’s impossible to get a chaise lounge. Even a spot to place your towel by the poolside is close to impossible. The overcrowding of the pool areas really put me off this hotel. I’m certain the Cosmo is going to lose a lot of non-party types due to the severe overcrowding of their two main swimming pools. Pool service – haha – what a joke. If you can even manage to find a chaise lounge don’t think they’ll be coming by offering drinks and Evian facial spritzers. This ain’t the Four Seasons……. The Guests / Crowd This average Cosmopolitan guest on the weekends is very young – under 35 yo – and there to party. My breaking point arrived when a very young and inebriated guest was being held up by two friends and projectile vomited in the elevator with a bit of it slopping onto my shoes. What else can I say about the Cosmopolitan? I’m glad to be out of there. Summary: Avoid this hotel like a plague if you expect good basic service and a mature adult crowd of guests. Service is very poor and the crowd is very young and party oriented.After arriving in Seattle at then end of a drive across the state, I called the hotel around 1400 to check to see if early check in would be possible. If not, we would just drive down to the waterfront and do through the aquarium. We were told by the hotel employee that she could not answer that over the phone, we need to go in to find out the answer. I realize that the answer to this question has several different variables: room availability, company policy, etc. However, we had traveled across the state with two kids and were just asking if it would be possible. I would have been happy to check in later. Once we arrived, we were checked in by the same individual that we had just spoken with. We were behind another couple that was checking in and I overheard the employee provide instructions to the couple ahead of us. After checking in, we were told that there was a daily parking charge of $15, which while somewhat reasonable, was not advertised at the time of the reservation. The unnamed employee (no nametag visible) then offered assistance to the next people in line to check in. At which point, I asked where the parking was. I received a blank look in return. After getting that it was below the building, I went to park my car. Now, I must comment that the parking garage leaves a LOT to be desired. The two handicapped spots that are next to the elevator are only marked for compact vehicles. I do not drive a compact vehicle. I can accept existing parking garage design restrictions prevent ideal parking spaces. I can also acknowledge that while they might meet the letter of the law for American with Disabilities Act, it does not make it convenient in any way. I was able to locate a parking spot further away from the elevator. But that presented a problem in itself. When my wife tried to bring the luggage cart to the car, she couldnâ€™t. The parking structure had a height restriction of 6 foot. The cart was taller than 6 foot. I was able to tilt the cart over and drag it through this height restricted area because it was empty. But, once loaded with our luggage, I could no longer perform this feat. I will point out that you can go around the parking garage to the other side where the height restriction allows the cart to pass through loaded. However, as previously mentioned, I am handicapped and walking any distance is rather difficult. Walking into my room was like hitting a wall of cheap cologne. I donâ€™t know if the smell was supposed to cover up a more foul stench, or if it was from the previous occupant. Either way, it was rather unpleasant, if not survivable. I proceeded to sit in the nice comfy chair only to find out that all the comfy qualities of said chair were worn out. The arms of the char were not nicely padded, instead the wood frame wound up digging into my arms. Sense I was on my long awaited vacation, I figured that I would make the best of things. I then took off my shoes and socks, I like walking around barefoot on carpet. Itâ€™s a small guilty pleasure after having my foot in and out of casts for four years. I walked across the room to splash some water on my face only to find that my feet stuck to the carpet with every step. I put my socks back on. Jump ahead to my shower experience. I will acknowledge that your hotel has â€œGone Green,â€� and while the shower head might be eco friendly, it is not person friendly. A high pressure, low volume nozzle is more fitting in a C&C environment, not in a shower. I found that the extra time spent trying to rinse off countered any water saving qualities that the shower head offers. The Elevators are smooth if not very slow. I am sure that this is a constant complaint, but let me address this. While waiting for the elevators, after several minutes, I began to look around for the stairs. I saw on the wall next to the elevators a sign indicating in case of a fire, use the stairs. Great sign, really useful to those that are unaccustomed to elevators, however, I saw no signs as to where these stairs were. Now, up until now I have talked about comfort features. This is a real safety issue. On day two, I was talking to another hotel patron about the long wait for the elevator. He mentioned to me that there are stairs at both ends of the hall, but they do not go down to the lobby. The stairs apparently only lead to the outside. For being an eco friendly hotel, not providing the option for stairs instead of the elevator seems a little short sighted. I know that this addresses a structure issue and not one easily overcome without major building modifications. I can say that the room had a very nice view of the Space Needle and was conveniently located next to the EMP, Space Needle, and the Pacific Science Center. But the hotel description fails to mention the fire station that must reside next to it. Between the sirens going off all night and the people running screaming down the hall, I found it really rather difficult to get any sleep. I will take the blame for not reporting the screamer to the front desk. By that time, I had pretty well given up on sleep and found it a distraction from the sirens. The four days and three nights that we spent in this hotel sounds more like a comedy of errors that the tragic experience that it was. When I spend my vacation time and my money on a hotel room, I expect far more that what I received. That being said, the experience was not a complete waste. After having spent my vacation in this hotel, I have absolutely no desire to stay in any other Best Western hotel again. If asked by family, friends or coworkers, I would not recommend this hotel.Do Not Go Here!!! Save yourself the money I am going to give you our experience exactly how it happened and you can decide if you would want to stay somewhere like this.....We just got back last nightWe got to the hotel to check in and they basically ignored us and told us to stand off to the side. After a couple minutes someone who barely speaks english comes and checks us in at this table off to the side, not even the front desk. Our room was not ready, so they told us to go to the restaurant, but didnt tell us where it was and they walked away. We tried to get them to tell us when our friends would be checking in but they wouldnt...The bell boy then walked our bags to our room...we walked down these dirty, dark hallways..very creepy. Our room had a good view, but it was dirty. The bed was very hard and they didnt even have a full fitted sheet..our legs and feet were on the bare matress! The 'mini bar' was barley stocked and was not cold. the shower had almost no water pressure and would go steeming hot and freezing cold every 30 seconds (no joke). The TV didnt work, it was just all fuzzy and the clock didnt work. Because the clock didnt work, we would call the front desk every so often and ask what time it was, most of the time we would get put on hold, transferred around and evenutally hung up on (this happened many, many times). Most of them also did not speak English. The 'main bar' by the pool has horrendous service. The bartenders would just ignore us. The first night we got there, we were standing there waiting (for about 20 min) and my boyfriend finally said excuse me to the bartender and she barely acknowldged him and when he started ordering drinks, then she walked away while he was in the middle of ordering and went to talk to the other bartender. She didnt make our drinks and just continued to have a conversation with her friend. At the seafood a la carte, we waited at the front door for about 10 mintues while all the workers walked by, ignoring us...we finally sat ourselves, and when we saw the manager walk by we said excuse me and he held his finger up to his lips and said shhhh. I was appauled. they did the same thing to the next couple that came to the restaurant. The tokyo a la carte was really good. The best food and service we had all week! The salad appitizer is really good! the italian restaurant was good too.There is only ONE buffet restaurant in the whole resort. It is open 7:30-10:30am...12:30-2:30pm....and 6:30-10:30pm. I personally think that the buffet was not open for long enough hours and the only other place to get food during the closed times is thesurf and turf snacks, which were disgusting. DO NOT eat the burgers there, they are never cooked properly and DO NOT eat the fish burger, my boyfriend chipped his tooth on a huge bone that was in it. I heard several other guests complaining about the food too. The selection at the buffet was also very poor, the food was almost unedible. I have seen others complain about the food at other all-inclusives, but have never had a problem with the food, but TRUST me, the food at the Barcelo Punta Cana is very poor quality. There were almost never any clean tables to eat at, and no one asked us for drinks, so you had to find your own cutlery and go get your own drinks. The beach was gorgeous and the pool was nice too. They only have one stereo system there, so if they are playing music at the beach, there will be no music at the pool and vice versa. The entertainment workers were VERY pushy to get you to play games to partake in activities. I was perfectly content watching my boyfriend and his friends play beach volleyball, but I had 3 separate male workers come up to me and harrass me to be part of a bikini contest, the second two that come over grabbed my arms and try to pull me over. I was so angry! I saw them to this to other girls too. Unexceptable!At nights, there were vendors set up on the resort to that you HAD to walk through them to go from your room to the restaurants. They were very agressive. I do not think this is a place that vendors should be. I was really surprised that the hotel would allow this.At the Casino they tried to cheat us out of $15. The other couple we were with was playing Black Jack, and the girl in the couple set aside $40 worth of chips that she would not play with...she did not want to lose the $40. When she went to cash it in, they gave her back $25, saying that is all she had. After we argued with them for 5 minutes, the finally gave her the $15. Also, DO NOT PLAY the 'bonus bingo'. We saw two different couples get scammed big time. One lost $5000, the other lost $14000. You need to get to 100 points and you acumulate them quickly, both these people got to 99 point with a large jackpot (over $50000US). They kept playing because all they needed was 'one more point', but they never got it of course...and once your in $1000, how can you stop? Excursions: DO NOT go on the excursions. We did the dune buggy one where the pictures show you going through jungles and on grass and on the beach and it is supposed to be 4 hours long...they take you there on a sketchy truck in the middle of a very poor area. While on the buggies, the do not give you goggles or any eye protection. you drive through this poor town to this 'cave' area with vendors set up all around. Kids run up to you and try to get you to buy all these things and if you say no they pout. As you are walking to the cave, vendors are constantly harrassing you. It is horrible! You leave this area to drive through the poor town again and they take you to a beautful beach, but they only let us stay here for 10 minutes. then it was over. It was about 45 mintues in total!! I couldnt believe it!The next excursion we went on was the marinarium. It looks cool in the pictures, but its is not what it seems. you go on a boat and they drive out to an area to take you snorkelling. There was next to no fish or anything in the area, but there are nurse sharks and mantarays in an enclosed cage area....not what i expected....you only actually snorkel for 25 mintues, then you drive around on the boat and listen to very loud music. the give you a very gross sandwhich you make yourself out of stale bread. All in all, this experience would make me never want to return to the Dominican Republic again. We were all excited to go home to Vancouver!! I have never been excitied to leave a trip! I would definately NOT stay at this hotel if you would like to go to the D.R. Other people I met on the plane/in the airport said the Gran Bahia was very good...I would stay there instead, or go to Mexico.I have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant.This was the single worst hotel experience of my life and as someone who does a lot of leisure and work travel, I have had my share of hotel stays. I actually live in Chicago, but as there was a music festival right downtown and I had some free nights through an SPG promotion, my wife and I thought it would be fun to stay at the W Lakeshore during the music festival. The first night was fine â€“ as a SPG Platinum member I was given a room on one of the top floors with a spectacular view. The second night, however, was a different story. My wife decided to return to the hotel earlier than I, as I was staying out late to see another band perform. She returned to a dark hotel room to have someone jump out of our bed and scream â€œWhat the **** are you doing? Get the **** out of our room!!!â€� Before she could leave the person physically pushed her out the door. According to her, it was the single most horrifying experience of her life. She was in total shock. She tried calling me, but unfortunately the music venue I was at had poor reception. After collecting herself she went to the front desk to explain that inexplicably some people were in our room. The front desk shocked her with their response. We had been checked out of the room because, according to this person, state law required luggage to be in the room for them to charge us for the room. Since the cleaning personnel saw no luggage in our room, we were checked out. Since we live in the city anyway we only had brought with us a single bag and had returned home that afternoon. The front desk person went on to tell her that the place was totally booked and there were no available rooms. My wife went home. By the time I found out I was furious, but it was late and my wife was shaken up and wanted me to come home. I figured it would be best to deal with the manager the next day. When I phoned the following day, all I could get was the managerâ€™s voicemail. So I instead called the SPG Platinum Desk and explained the situation to them. They were shocked and claimed they had never heard of such a policy of checking people out automatically if no luggage were in the room. I explained I wanted to know why our keys still worked if they checked us out and pointed out that my wife was put in a potentially dangerous position by the hotel with how this was handled. I went on to ask why they made no attempt to contact me to notify me I was being checked out by the hotel even though they clearly had my phone and email available. The Platinum Desk told me they were filing a complaint and the GM of the hotel would contact me within 48 hours. Here was the response I received: Good evening, I received your file from Starwood Corporate and I apologize about your experience last night. As you stated, we had your reservation through today but when my Style team serviced the room, there were no signs of any guest staying in the room. I personally inspected the room around 10pm and the room was still vacant. At that point it is Starwoodâ€™s policy that we must check out any vacant room even if their reservation is through the following day. The only way the hotel can leave a room registered is if we were informed there would be someone taking over the room or if there are physical signs of someone occupying the room. Again, I am very sorry that you and your friend had to experience this late last night. I would love to personally WOW you on your next visit to the W Lakeshore, so once you have made your plans and reservations please contact me and I will make sure you have a wonderful experience. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Warm regards, Grant Grant Bruce |Welcome Desk Manager W Chicago Lake Shore 644 North Lake Shore Drive |Chicago| IL 60611 t: 312.943.9200 |f: 312.255.4499 [email]grant.bruce@whotels.com[/email] I replied that I had no plans to stay at their hotel again. I said I would like an explanation as to why I was never contacted to be told I was being checked out. I also said I would like to know why, if we were checked out, our key still worked for the room placing us in an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous situation. The following day I received this email from the General Manager: Well Hello There, Thanks for visiting us at the W Chicago - Lakeshore. We miss you already. How was your escape? Did you experience Whatever/Whenever service? Why not whisper how your escape was to us? We would love to hear from you! Email me your thoughts on your visit and how we can grant your wishes in the future at [email]GMHeather.Steenge@whotels.com[/email] Warmest wishes, Heather Steenge-Hart, General Manager I sent Heather my issues with our stay and the same questions I had sent to Grant. I never received any response from either Heather the General Manager or Grant the Welcome Desk Manager. I think for the W to give any guest this treatment is absolutely detestable. And the fact that I am at the highest level of their customer loyalty program (Platinum) says that this status counts for nothing when it comes to common courtesy and respect. I should also point out that the W Lakeshore never credited back the free night that they took away from me by selling the room to someone else the second night of my reservation. When I realized the night had never been credited back to my account I had to again call the SPG Platinum desk and explain the situation to them before I was finally credited back the free night. I would recommend avoiding this hotel and staying at the Westin River North or the Westin Michigan Ave.I've waited a while to write this review, as this hotel was such a bad experience, I was simply trying to block it out. I've stayed at more than thirty of the four stars in Manhattan by now, and I generally don't care for most of them - New York is a city where you seem to have to pay the dollars to stay at a five star or a boutique hotel to get an exceptional service and comfort experience, and if you are hardly in the room, it doesn't seem worth it. Still, there are plenty that give you a clean, functional room that allows a comfortable stay. I needed one extra night when I extended my stay for the US Open and the Marriott I was staying at the second week was booked, so I used priceline and was quite surprised when I was given this hotel which I mistakenly imagined was higher than the priceline four star bid level (based on W hotels in other cities). Well, from the moment i checked into the rude, horrifying desk, I was treated according to my priceline-station-in-life. The woman could not muster a smile or a welcome as she pushed the room key toward me. The room I was given was simply a disaster. First of all, there isn't anything special about these rooms. Cheap "trendy" furniture, and what is supposed to pass for a modern look, which is actually dated compared to the equivalent hotels elsewhere in the world. I wasn't concerned with the decor, however. My first and foremost concern is that many parts of this particular room had not been vacuumed in what must have been years. I'd lay in bed and look down below the side table, and never mind the whole candy wrapper, the nail clippings, and other filth, the thick layer of grey fuzz dust was astonishing. The edges of the desk, the shelves, but most appallingly, any area of the carpet that was not easily accessible to the vacuum was totally filthy. One large oily stain on the mattress sheet. Stains on the pillow cases. I have not experienced this in a four star, what is more a W. The bahtroom tiles cracked in more places than I could count. A big black dent in the tub. The toilet didn't flush, and I called downstairs. They fixed that. The toiletries were nice, and thats the only good thing I can recall. The lighting which is the mood lighting that perhaps appeals to a certain younger clientele (god knows why) was depressing, nonfunctional, and simply a joke. I've stayed at art-tech hotels around the world and maybe this place is trying to emulate those. They should not try. Get a lighting expert in, and fix the placement of the bulbs to garner the same effect, but in a functional way. I was too tired from the US Open to care to make a big fuss, but the next day upon checkout I asked for a receipt. I was refused a receipt showing a zero balance, because I had used priceline. Three rude women, one a manager, kept telling me I could not get a receipt. I've used the same service for maybe a hundred hotel stays and have always been able to get a printed hotel record of my stay. But no, these ladies could not be bothered. I got so tired of being ignored as they went about their business behind the desk, I even left for a few hours and asked that they figure it out upon my return to retrieve my bags The checkout was so horrifyingly inefficient, with one individual ATTEMPTING to handle all the bags people wanted to store for the day, and not managing at all - and piles of tourists standing around in the lobby cursing or complaining about the bad service. It took 35 minutes to hand a tiny bag to this man, who seemed angry the whole time he tried to take bags to storage. It took almost as long to retrieve it upon my return. The idiot desk-folk had still not figured out how to print a hotel receipt documenting my stay upon my return. This was the final straw and I asked to speak to a manager. I listed the problems in my room, and the state of filth in the room, as well as the checkout fiasco and all i got was "I assure you, we vacuum the rooms" with a blank stare. And this was the manager. Had I not been so tired from that weekend, and wiped out by moves between hotels and Flushing Meadows, I would have insisted on a room inspection. But every request at this hotel took so long, I would have missed my flight. The place was a zoo, and a poorly run zoo. Chaotic, noisy, unfriendly. Finally, and most irritatingly - a pet peeve of mine is when hotel staff treat guests differently, based clearly on what the assume their station in life is, all in the span of minutes. This is an idiotic asinine habit that you usually find in slightly higher end hotels (but not in the very best hotels), among poorly trained staff. You can find them lavishing one hotel guest with attention,respect, welcoming smiles....while not spending a second in attending to another moments later. I observe this from afar, and in this particular case, near - and find it appalling. These surface judgements of merit and worth have no place in the service industry, and any place that doesn't value all their customers equivalently deserves a zero rating. You can't judge a book by its cover. A person's clothing, luggage, sunglasses or nail manicure are not the basis for your hospitality. Learn what it means to provide service. This hotel was certainly one such place, all pretense and with no substance. I've never been treated so poorly, in visiting NYC six or more times annually. Train your staff. Clean your rooms. Meanwhile, I shall keep away and warn everyone I know not to stay at this particular W hotel.I am actually staying at the Desert Rose at the moment, have been here for 6 nights as I am unable to shorten my stay without being charged for the full week. Not enjoying it one little bit so it's difficult to know where to start with my comments. Firstly I would like to warn anyone staying here of the telephone charges. I made three calls to the UK on the room phone for 3 mins 20 seconds, 3 mins 59 seconds and 4 mins 35 seconds - the charges for these calls were $53, $46 and $53 respectively. Obviously I'd expect a call from a hotel phone to be something like $10 for a few minutes but that is ridiculous. When I complained to the manager they simply had no explanation but agreed that their charges are 'extortionate'. Thanks guys. Secondly, the place is infested with moths. To a massive extent. I have just killed three of these in the last hour and they have plagued the week I have spent here. I have had them crawling on me, flapping in my ear while I was asleep, everywhere. Disgusting. Thirdly, there is a roach problem, although I have only caught 2 or 3 in my actual room, the corridors and outdoors are really bad and other guests have complained about their rooms being worse. And they're big ones too. Fourthly, although the place looks close to the big hotels when you look on a map or Google Earth, the walk is really terrible - the sewers in this block smell absolutely disgusting - to the extent that I wretched repeatedly, and there is no proper lighting. My girlfriend was approached in a car during the late afternoon and since there is virtually no one around the area and it backs onto the testosterone-fueled-moronic-whoop-fest which is Hooters Hotel it was a worry. Fifthly, forget about the pool. There are 144 large condos in this development. with I suppose an average of 3 people staying in each. There are approx 35 sunbeds. You do the maths, but even in Vegas people do like to use the pool and this one is woefully inadequate. It's not that great either. For the last four days we have been walking the mile or so to the Luxor to pay $10 to use their pool - didn't expect to have to do that but there is literally no choice. Sixthly, it's the noisiest place I've stayed since I last went to Ibiza aged 18. I didn't come to Vegas for the peace and quiet but when I put the do-not-disturb sign on the door (that incidentally says "Shhhh... I'm sleeping") I don't really expect housekeeping to slam their trolleys relentlessly against the walls and constantly SHOUT at each other. That was really bad. Other guests were loud idiots too, but I'm not blaming that on the hotel (oh, okay, go on then I will). Finally, far be it for me to be a snob but the clientele that this place attracts are very hit and miss. The breakfast buffet is like feeding time at the zoo. I't's held right in the middle of the lobby, the food is shocking and in order to reduce costs (I guess) the management provide nowhere to eat properly, no trays and flimsy plastic plates. I saw someone with a bowl of bran flakes with a hard boiled egg balanced in the middle while they poured milk on them. Another elderly lady was perched on an easy chair in her nightdress, she had clearly walked directly from bed to the buffet bypassing every sink, hairbrush and item of everyday clothing. A pink nightie with no underwear, shoes or socks was just the ticket for her mealtime - and just the thing to put me off eating. I only went to the buffet once although I did get some jam on my clothes when I sat down in the lobby another day (does that count?). I'm a well travelled chap and I'm very reasonable and give credit where it's due. The hotel was good about calling taxis to get us from A to B. The concierge booked a nice restaurant for my birthday and generally the place is spacious. The staff were on the whole functional but not particularly friendly or exceptional. I'm quite reluctant to say this is a bad hotel, because I did a lot of homework before I booked this trip and virtually everywhere I looked said this place was great. But in all honestly it's not. It's pretty damn bad. And I hate to admit I picked the wrong place but I did. But please don't stay here unless you get a knock-out cheap rate. There are way better places to stay in Vegas and some hotels have real bargain rates at the moment. If you do stay here don't make any phone calls, don't expect to use the pool, enjoy your breakfast, have any peace and quiet or a pleasant stroll to the strip. And bring a nose clip unless you like the smell of sewage. Oh, and ear plugs to drown out the noise of the outdated air-con. Do bring a microscope because the bugs and crawlies could make excellent study projects for the kids.15% gratuity automatically added to the bill.Let me start by saying that I've written a lengthy report of our experience if you are interested, but if you are one of those who prefers a shorter review.... This hotel was awful. As I've detailed below, the rooms are old and have obviously not been checked for quality (see below), only some contain the "Sleep Number" beds that Radisson boasts, the management is horrible and treats you as though "you should be lucky we let you stay here" attitude if you book on sites such as Priceline, and is an overall terrible experience. I am not one of those that looks for much out of a hotel besides a comfortable bed, good service, and cleanliness, but this hotel does not have any of them! Our first image of the hotel was an extraordinarily busy lobby (about 2:00pm on a Thursday) with only one guest service attendant. After a short wait (totally unacceptable for a desk that could accommodate 3-4 GS Reps) we were called over to a small desk by an Asian female who we were later told was a manager on duty. She checked us in silently accept to ask for my ID and credit card. I jokingly said that is was my birthday so please make sure I have a great room to which she responded with a sarcastic (ha ha) and kept silently about her business. My partner and I were lifelessly directed to the elevators and entered a very small room that had 1 very small double bed when the reservation was made for two people. I called down to ask about changing to a larger room. The phone was answered by the same lifeless personality that checked us in, and after expressing my issue, she asked for my room number and what my room number was and that she would return my call momentarily. During the next ten minutes we looked around the room only to find paint peeling from the ceiling and a not so pleasant smell. After my call went un-returned (10 minutes later) I called the desk, was answered by the same lifeless personality and was told I would again be given a call back - all with no answer to my complaint. This time the call was returned after about 2 minutes. I was told that because I booked through Priceline, I automatically got the smallest room despite my reservation being for two. However, she would, "as a courtesy", upgrade the room if there was something available. After two more five minute waits I was told that all larger beds were sold out for the evening but to check back later that night. Having worked in the hotel industry before an knowing that this is a common falsity I checked the Radisson websites availability for the evening an low and behold it had queens and kings available. My partner asked to speak with the general manager , and explained not only our issue about the room, but also the fact that we were lied to. This gentlemen (which I will identify as being of Middle Eastern or Indian decent) apologized for the lie by saying that previous manager only had limited access to the hotel's availability and that's was the reason for the inconsistency. Instead of handling the remainder of the issue himself, he stood by while he had a gentlemen he introduce as his "assistant" checked availability (he did however step in to say that if he was given the opportunity to make money off of us he would do what he could) and then once larger rooms were found he offered to upgrade the room for a fee! We explained the previous offer for a courtesy upgrade and he replied that he didn't know why she would offer this and that he would need to call her. At this point he disappeared into a back room. His assistant Michael followed him and returned saying that he would process our courtesy upgrade. We were then told to leave our original keys in the room after "moving our things as soon as possible." Upon exiting the original room, a housekeeper in the hall asked if we had "messed anything up in the room" with the connotation that she did not want to go in and clean it. He apologized and stated that the only room he had available to upgrade us to was on the noisiest level of the hotel. We accepted and were sent to a room that had a foul odor and a 5 inch square hole in the wall's vent paneling that blocked the electrical system. ( Prime exposure for bugs, rats dust, etc.) As if that were not bad enough we the ledge outside was covered with cigarette butts! We of course felt uncomfortable in this room and notified the manager again by phone, and were told to wait so he could come down and see what I was talking about. After another 10 minute wait we went upstairs to find him sitting at the desk talking to other guests. He changed the room to another on the same level which, as I tried to enter, was blocked by the housekeeper's closet left open with a broom. After she closed the door, we entered the room to be greeted by an even worse foul odor (smelled like a dumpster had been emptied), a dirty stained window, and a view cinder blocks, and loud air conditioning units. After returning to the desk, we were given a fourth room room on the hotel's top floor *which takes to elevators to get to). The room was much better with the exception of the chipped paint on the bathroom fixtures,missing handles on the dressers, broken iron, and incomplete towel set (which we had to wait about 35 minutes for to be replaced) As it was my birthday, and more than two hours after our arrival, we chose to ignore these things and kept the room. The remainder of our stay was filled with inconveniences and overheard constant complaints of others: 1. When we left and returned to our room, our keys did no longer worked and had to take 2 trips on the 2 elevator ride to the top level to get back to our room. 2. We heard several other guests complain about false charges, $100 hikes in rate to extend their stays, and one guest even expressed that his hair dryer was sparking and he felt unsafe during his stay. During checkout, that I could not wait for!! I waited about 10 minutes at the again under-manned desk, while the Middle Eastern rude manager who disappeared and never returned the day before stood and watched the slow progression of guests checking out. I was asked about my stay, and explained my problems only to be told that nothing could be done to accommodate me because I booked with Priceline, but that I should have a nice day! Do yourself a favor..never stay here!I wish I had read more hotel reviews before booking this hotel! I don't consider myself to be a picky traveler and I consider the hotel, just a place to stay when you are not out having fun. I tried to ignore the short falls of the hotel but in the end there were just way too many!! We arrived late at night on Feb. 20th. They put us in a corner room in building five and everything seemed great. As we start unpacking (11:30 pm) we notice that we are in a 3 bedroom 2 bath instead of a 3 bedroom, 3 bath. We called downstairs to find out what was going on and then found out that they had no 3 bedroom 3 baths open, and that we would have to wait until the next day after checkout (9am - 11am) to move. I couldn't believe they wouldn't have told us that at the desk when we checked in???!!!! They just put us in the wrong room and acted like nothing was wrong. So the next morning we had to then repack everything and delay our kids from going to Disney. We hung out in the lobby for an hour waiting for word on our room. Finally at 11 they told us to go to Disney and that they would move our belongings to our new room and everything would be ready when we came back. Lie #2 Nothing had been done when we returned back to the hotel. We had to move all of our things to tower one, a dirty room overlooking the parking lot of the Factory outlet. Lie #3 They then told us how sorry they were and that they would comp our room the first night. (Read Below - this was another lie) Lie#3 My husband was in Orlando on business and had to have the internet. He called the hotel ahead of time to make sure they had wifi. Needless to say, we were never able to get any internet connection in our room. He went out and purchased a cable and we were still never able to get any access. The hotel then lied again to say usually they do have access but it was down. When we finally moved into our room in tower one at 9:30 pm my young kids were worn out and ready for bed. We went to make up the couch bed only to find the sheets were the wrong size. We called to get sheets and they told us they would be right up(Lie #4). 35 minutes later still no sheets. I had to get dressed and go down to the lobby to get them to send sheets up to our room. We wore flip flops in our room because it was so dirty. We stopped using the kitchen because there were small spider looking bugs everywhere. We didn't notice them at first, but they got into our cereal boxes. So we threw everything away and ate at Dunkin Donuts for breakfast and the Irish pub for dinner. The burger there was delicious! We spent no time out on our balcony because it overlooked a parking lot - very disappointing. The kids did enjoy getting in the tubs in the bathroom every night and relaxing after a long day in the parks. My kids complained a few times that they had bites behind their knees and underarms. I ignored it thinking maybe mosquitoes. After reading reviews since I returned from my trip I see many people have complained about bed bugs. I am wincing in disgust hoping that I did not bring any home with me. If I did there will be a major PROBLEM! The swimming pool was great. The kids loved the slide and the hot tubs were very relaxing. The life guard had to leave the slide closed several times to constantly get more towels, that was kind a bummer for my boys. Also, plan well, because as the sun goes down the pool is shaded and cold. They told us they were not going to charge us for the first night. At checkout they then told my husband they were not going to charge us for two nights because of the problems with the room and internet. Upon getting our bill we noticed that they only discounted our bill for the resort fee for two nights - that's 20 dollars. Careful with the taxi drivers at the hotel they wanted to charge us 30 dollars to bring us to the parks and 65 to the airport. Sadly we paid that not knowing we could get it a lot cheaper. Shame on them for taking advantage and shame on the hotel for letting them. We rented a van so my husband could get back and forth to his class. Parking was very limited and sometimes you just had to park on the road or park far away from your tower. In conclusion ( after reading reviews about this hotel for the last year) it seems like the hotel is going downhill rapidly!!! There may still be some good rooms left in the newer towers. If you are staying here you may want to contact those people who wrote good reviews and ask what their room number was. I was in building one on the 7th floor - I would stay away from this whole tower! Good Luck If my bill is not resolved I am considering reporting this hotel to the better business bureau. I am definitely following up on the bed bug investigation someone mentioned in their post.Every 2 years my mom who is now 80yrs young and I travel, my husband goes to work. We try to go to an all-inclusive because of the convenience. Two years ago we went to El Conquistador Hotel in San Juan (not an all-inclusive) it was wonderful. Let me start with the bus that picked us up at the airport to take us to the Paradisus. After flying in from Philadelphia we were a bit tired from the travel. They had us walk a distance to the bus pulling along our luggage. It turns out we were the only 2 people on the bus and they couldn't meet us at our airline...The girl who met us at the airport saw my mom was exhausted and finally offered to take her suitcase. They had us waiting on the bus for about 15 minutes as the bus driver socialized outside the bus. After 45 minutes we arrived at the hotel and checked in. Our room was not ready and we decided to eat lunch and make reservations for the restaurants. We knew from past experiences its important to do that immediately or else we'd be stuck eating only at the buffets. We were given a hard time making the reservation since we didn't have the key to the room even though we knew the room number. I wouldn't give in and we got our reservations. I asked for 7 pm and they said it wasn't available but the times we were given were from 6-6:45. The first night we went to the Italian buffet and had to wait 45 minutes for a table. When we were seated we saw alot of empty tables and a number of tables that had to be cleaned off. I was furious that we had to wait so long. We were not the only ones. If a party of 10 walked in the hostess would seat them first all others had to wait. It's amazing that one would have to wait for a buffet when you are getting up and getting the food yourself. It didn't make sense since the tables were available. Right from the start I felt that the hotel didn't care about the people. By the way the food was quite fair. Our first restaurant with a reservation was Avacado the food was just ok, nothing to rave about. The service was awful. I asked for water 3 times before it was finally given. The second night we went to Romantico, we both ordered lamb chops medium, it came to us cold and bleeding. We sent it back and I think they put a match under it. Needless to say we didn't eat our meal. The last night we ate at Bamboo and it was very good. At the first 2 restaurants as we sat there we saw a number of empty seats at 7:00 the time we requested and were told it was booked at 7pm. We didn't appreciate being lied to either. We were told there is entertainment every night which also bought us to this hotel. The first night they had a show but we were to tired to see it. We thought we would catch the other shows. To our surprise there wasn't any as Loreal was having a convention and they were to busy setting that up. Because of that the guests had to suffer. People just sat around drinking or going to the casino, which is where we spent our nights. Our room was nice but we had flying bugs so we had to have the room sprayed. They have service to get you around the resort, the only trouble is it comes every 20 minutes. We were lucky enough that we were near the pool and restaurants. We had waited for the tram at the pool and they told us to go to the front of the resort. When we got to the front they said go to the back. We didn't feel anyone actually knew what was going on. I also asked if they had a computer service and they weren't sure. The last day someone finally told me that it was in the business office. Maybe it was our fault but I was under the impression there was a beach and we could go in the ocean. My mistake. They had some lounge chairs on grass with the ocean as the background. The pool was dirty. They had what looked like a hot tub or whirlpool with jets in the center of the pool. I got into the water which happened to be cold and got to the whirlpool and found out it was just jets and it was not a hot-tub. I thought that was rediculous to sit there and have cold water jets on your back. There wasn't a hot-tub at the pool but for $28.00 a day you could use the one at the spa along with the steam room and sauna. I was wondering what happened to ALL INCLUSIVE! We called for bottled water as our house keeper forgot to to put new bottles in our mini bar. They told us that there would be a $3.00 charge to bring it to our room....my mom told them it could wait until later. That type of thing turns me off to a place to be so petty. We did confront the manager about our gripes. We felt something should have been done to rectify some of the things we told her about. She said she would tell someone the next day and they would get back to us. Of course that never happened. We were very unhappy with this resort and would NOT reccommend it to anyone!Finally, I got sick of the bad service, obnoxious smirks, and snotty back talk.Maybe it's that most of Dumont's patrons are younger and have lower expectations, but I cannot recommend Dumont.After a wonderful stay at the Sheraton Maui last year, I am sorry to say that this year's stay was stressful, to say the least. Let me start off by saying that the grounds, pool, and beach are very nice. The rooms are just average (in need of refurbishment), but I knew that already. The housekeeping, restaurant staff, and bellmen were all great. However, the management team that we dealt with were VERY poor. I am a Starwood member and use Starwood hotels 2-3 times per year on vacations. I have always been very pleased with the treatment at their hotels. Last year, I booked a gardenview room at the Maui Sheraton and received an upgrade to Building 6, which is deluxe oceanfront. This year, I booked a gardenview at a discounted rate and knew that we may get an upgrade, but also knew it wasn't guaranteed. This is what happened. We arrived at noon and were told to come back at 3, as our room wasn't ready. No problem. We gave our keys to the valet and were told to leave our luggage in the car, lock it, and it would remain in the lot by the valet desk. They also told us that we would be in building 6. Since we hadn't expected that, we were very excited! We returned to the front desk at 3, only to be told that our room STILL wasn't ready. Hard to believe, since we arrived at noon that they couldn't get ONE room ready for us by 3pm! We were then told that we would be in building 3 in a mountainview room (which is same as gardenview, but on 3rd floor). I asked why we had been told that we were in building 6, then changed, and was told by Brandon, the Asst. Man., that they had the right to do that. We then went to find our car, but no one knew where it was! Finally, we were told that it had been moved to the parking garage with ALL of our luggage left in the car! Very upsetting, as we had been told it would stay in sight of the valet desk. Went back to Brandon expressing how upset I was about the room being changed, room not being ready, and now car being moved with our things still in it! He said he sympathized, but could do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about any of it!! I asked if we could just get a room in building 3 that faced the pool, but he declined. Funny, I had just heard them tell a lady that just checked in that she had been upgraded from gardenview to oceanview, but he coudn't do anything for us, who had been there at NOON! I told him that I was going to call Starwood, as we had never received such poor service at a Starwood facility before. Went to our room, called, and was transferred to Sheraton Corporate Headquarters. Robert acknowledged our many stays and said he would contact the hotel. MIRACULOUSLY, within 30 minutes, Brandon phoned to say that he had just had an opening in Building 6 that we could be moved into. We were then moved. Keep in mind that I wasn't upset just because we didn't get Building 6---I didn't even ask for Building 6. I was upset that we were told we were in it, then changed, in addition to the room not being ready and the car missing. I thought that once we moved, things would settle down. WRONG! Next day, my friend called and asked if I had received the gift basket she had ordered from the Sheraton. No we hadn't. She called and spoke with the manager of that department, who was also not very well trained on dealing with customers. What if she hadn't called? She may have been charged and never known we didn't receive it! He told her that it had been sent to our first room in Building 3 BEFORE our arrival, but we had switched rooms so didn't get it. NOT TRUE, because we WERE in that room and there was NO gift basket. When she asked him for the name of his superior, he refused to tell her! He did tell her he would send an additional gift basket with the one she ordered. The additional basket ended up being 2 waters, 2 cans of pop, and 2 small bags of chips. Why bother? The first basket that she had ordered came first with NO card even attached! My friend then spoke to Allison, another manager, who did acknowledge the error and removed the charge from my friend's credit card. Day 3, I went to talk to Allison and thanked her for taking care of my friend's situation. We had a brief conversation about the events at check-in and she made SURE to remind me that I had booked a gardenview and should not have expected building 6, even if I had been told I had it. She also had an excuse for everything I had complained about. Her objective, clearly, was to make sure I understood that I was in the wrong and didn't acknowledge any wrongdoing on the part of the hotel. The main reason I went to see her was to see about staying another night, since our first day had been ruined by the lengthy and stressful checkin. She was gracious about giving us another night at the rate we already paid. I told her I would gladly change rooms, but she kept us in the same one. In retrospect, I wish we just would've left when scheduled, because her attitude toward me was one of scolding a little child, NOT of trying to make a guest's experience more positive. This is a minor detail, but I had also been assured when I booked that we would have an acknowledgment of our anniversary, but that never happened either. Needless to say, I won't be back to the Sheraton. I have read online and in the Honolulu Advertiser about how Maui has been making tourists feel unwelcome, lately. The management at the Sheraton did a GREAT job of making us feel that way! Summer On the up side, we had a wonderful stay at the Outrigger Waikiki for the 4th time and were made to feel welcome by all of their staff!This was our Honeymoon!, we'd been to Mexico before 2years ago and stayed at the Riu Cancun (<--- Brilliant hotel!), and decided we wanted to have our honeymoon back at Mexico. The reason we picked this place was for all the wildlife, jungle environment you just dont get in Cancun. However - I would NOT come back to this place if you paid me!, if anything this resort has put us off Mexico for a good while. Firstly we were given a room with two small doubles and when we explained to reception they were quite un willing to do anything, until we got a little cross!, he gave us his business card and to come back at 3pm, we wasnt suprised to find him gone when we came back, had to explain all over again (by this time we was not happy), however they upgraded us to a junior suite. The grounds of this place are the only good part, little ruins dotted about, wildlife all around, I lost count of how many lizards and coati's just running about! - Great!. Other than that this resort offered nothing but mostly rude staff too busy counting any tips they'd received then actually giving any service! - How they got tips, I just dont know - Must be people giving tips in order to GET some service!. Admittedly we did read many reviews prior to going and thought people were just being over fussy - THEY ARE NOT!. We would class ourselves as quite easy going, if anything like to be left alone to enjoy ourselves BUT in this place you are just plain ignored by the staff you dont expect. I.e Service in the La Buffet (renamed by me .. La Crap) is horrendous, the beach one not much better, you are lucky to get offered a cup of luke warm tea / coffee just as your finishing your meal and not once did we get the sugar / milk or teabags at the same time - Dont even think you'll get a teaspoon - I just dont think they own any!!, get used to stirring your tea with the end of your knife / fork. Personally I would have prefered a self service for hot drinks, but should you look to be helping yourself, the staff get very irritated with you and send you away signalling they will bring it over (eventually they do). Also food in the buffets was very poor, offering broccolli for breakfast, lunch & dinner, apparantly they themed the nights however I didnt see any difference in the two weeks we stayed. The deserts looked nice but tasted dry or soggy, I mainly lived on Chicken / Turkey potatoes and rice for dinner, cereals for breakfast and Im not a fussy eater!, my husband did try most in case there was actually something nice to eat but found the Food to be samey, tasteless, chewy, dry, and pooly presented. TIP once seated place something obvious on your table otherwise you may find someone else sitting there who was also seated by the staff (this happened to us twice and on one occasion my husband sat down at another table which looked empty for a waiter to come over shouting abuse at us!). We did get friendly with our concierge (bdg 20) and he kindly made us restaurant reservations for every night of our second week (THANK GOODNESS). Every restaurant was good besides the sonora grill - steak house as we walked out from here for being ignored for almost 40mins after watching others who were seated after us getting served before, I polietly pointed this out to a member of staff who got quite rude - I dont need to be spoken to like that!. The steak in the mexican restaurant was mmmmm & the drinks you get offered in the restaruants were not watered down like what you get everywhere else round the resort, we actually felt tipsy after three! everywhere else we were drinking apparent acholic drinks and still felt fine even after say 12!. This place is doesnt offer much in way entertainment - evening entertainment is in the theatre which I found to be quite weird, rows of seats, no where to put your drinks, and for the daytime being that only xcaret and xplor is next door unless your paying for it you are very limited to whats on offer in and around the resort, except the obvious like mini golf, tennis or tabletennis. Also, only two bars are open of the evening, one by the theatre and one in the lobby, and people queue (you will do alot of queing at this place, queue for seating, queue for reception, queue for drinks!), but staff seem to serve in their own order - maybe its the colour of your wristband.... i dont know. The taxi to Playa del carmen is 100peso's each way and only takes 5-10mins - YAY Escaped! and we ended up getting discounted tickets for xcaret (315pesos for two) from the first club , this will be the "Gift" every staff is just trying to offer you, you spend two hours of listening to rubbish from a rep who basically confirmed that unless your in the first club your no better then cattle (her words) and that the maintenance given to other rooms in the occidental resorts are minimal - we were kindly informed of this after we told her of some issues we had with our room with the toilet not working, air con problems and the patio door falling clean out the runner !!!!!!! - I'm just glad it was my husband who was opening the door at the time as I'd think I'd still be stuck under the patio door!. The friendiest staff were the housemaids, gardeners and pool waiters. All in all, our best time at this place was being left alone sitting round the pool!!.... Other than that we had some great days out, just a little disapointed to have to return back to the hotel, we tried on many occasions to jump someone elses coach!. I could continue to ramble about how poor this was, how poor that was as there was so much more, I wanted to come home by day 4..... Should you choose to stay at this hotel then "more for you, you was warned" !!.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.The food was mediocre and the service was severely slow.The service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush, this is not the place for you.I arrived in Singapore at 11:30Am and was met by a taxi driver arranged by my tour operator. It took about 30 minutes to travel from the airport to the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel at Noon, I asked to check in early if possible (normal check in time is 3PM). I was told that there was a charge of $147.50 for early check in. This was quoted at the normal daily rate, not the price I paid with my package. I declined to pay the additional charge and sat in the lobby for 2 1/2 hours. At 2:30 PM an Asian Couple arrived and checked in as I watch them pay with their credit card. So I was disturbed that they had allowed this couple to check in while I continued to sit on the couch. I walked up to the front desk and demanded my room, after seeing the couple check in. The employee saw tha I was in no mood to discuss it and complied to get me a room. When I arrived in the room, the room was a total wreck. I turned and looked at the hotel employee and said this was unacceptable. He agreed and went down stairs and got me a new room. My new room was ready and I had no complaint. At 8PM I decided to retire early. Sometime later I was awakened by this banging noise on my door. It turned out to be the night latch that someone was opening and closing the door. I jumped out of bed undid the night latch and saw a drunk man an a hotel employee standing outside my door. I happened to notice that the man was holding a hotel key. I looked to the hotel employee and asked why I was being woken up and what this gentleman was doing with a key to my hotel room. He said that he was told the room was empty and he had helped this gentleman bring up his luggage. I informed him that it was very obvious that I was staying in the room and to please not disturb me again. The next day I went on a tour which included a lot of walking. This was ok except that the humidity was very high and I never stopped sweating. However, the driver of the tour bus was outstanding. He saw that I was not use to the weather and getting very hot he made me comfortable and offer his further assistance if needed. When I arrived back at the hotel, I purchased 2 days of internet service as I had mainly come to Singapore to rest. I also asked to speak to the manager so that I could inform him of the previous nights incident. I was told the manager was not in. I asked that they have him contact me we he arrived. I went to my room and disturbed to find that there was no bottled water, tap water is not always advisable to drink. So I took a shower and went to a store and bought water. The food in the hotel was not very good, especially the provided breakfeast included in the price of the hotel. The food had no seasoning that I could taste and the selection of food was sparse. The breakfast was not an international menu. I ate their only 1 more time and ordered off the menu. The foor was unremarkable. I went to the mall, there were 2 within walking distance and did some shopping. Again it was very humid. I purchased more water and returned to the hotel. As I entered the door I noticed the front desk handing some bottled water to some hotel guests. This was my 2nd day at the hotel, so I asked if the hotel provided bottle water in the rooms. They said yes. So I asked them why my room had no bottled water for 2 days? The auditor said He would bring the water up to my room himself right away. I went upstairs and turned on the internet and watched TV for more than 2 hours. No water arrived in my room. So I called back downstairs and asked if they would bring up my water. Shortly thereafter my water was delivered. I asked if they had laundry service available? The gentleman said yes just fill out the laundry request and put my clothes in the bag provided. I asked what bag and what laundry list as I had seen nothing like this. So this person check for both and found neither. He left and came back with both. When he handed them to me, I asked him if he had a pen as there was no pen or paper in the room. Also I asked about the manager and why he had not contacted me. Of course the hotel employee said he did not know. I called the Tour Operator and told them of my experience so far at this hotel. She said she would contact the Sales Manager and have him contact me. It about 30 minutes later the Sales Manager called asked to meet me downstairs. I agreed and sat down and explained to the sales manager, Patrick, all the problems I had encountered. Patrick thanked me for my "good feedback". He said that he would investiagate my concerns and get back with me. Bottom line, he never called me back. Prior to my checking out I asked to speak with him and he said, Yes, we are sorry. Turned and walked away.n I said loudly in the hotel lobby, Excuse ME? is that it. He said yes and enetered his office.The place just isn't ready for prime time.Stayed here Thanksgiving week 2008. I called to get general information on TI. Asked the reservations person if in room refrigerators were available. She said “yes for fifteen dollars”. I asked is that fifteen dollars per stay or per day? Because I am staying there for 9 nights. She replied yes fifteen dollars per stay. I made reservations in September and reserved the fridge. I arrive at the hotel and I am told by the person checking us in that it was fifteen dollars per day. I informed her that I was told by TI reservations it was fifteen dollars per stay. She shrugged her shoulders and said it was fifteen dollars per day. I informed her that with the information I was given I had provisions for a refrigerator, fifteen dollars a day was ridiculous. She did not bother to call a manager, just smiled and said again oh well it’s fifteen dollars a day. We were tired from traveling and did not feel like arguing and we bought a few things for mornings that had to be refrigerated. She would not be able to do anything about this. I didn’t bother to make an issue of this with a manager later, we just wanted to start vacation and have a good time. We bought a $2.00 styro cooler at Walmart that worked fine the rest of the trip. All we wanted was to keep a few things cold for morning snack and keep ice in the room. The refrigerator was wheeled into our room on a old, dirty, rickety, squeaky, plastic and metal cart. It was hideous. I have never seen hotel room refrigerator that looked so disgusting in my life. It looks like TI does this on purpose so the guests are compelled to not have it in the room spend money in their overpriced restaurants. We only used the refrigerator for one day and returned it. Did not eat at any of the TI restaurants because it didn’t look like the food or atmosphere was worth the money. We did try to eat and have drinks at the Social House about 3 times but never did because they were closed each time we tried. 3 nights in one week ? Even the Social casino lounge was closed at 10:00 pm. [-] . Finding a restaurant was a chore. The Coffee shop an overpriced diner, boring for dinner. $13 for a cheese omlette. PHO does not excite me. The Social house was never open. Isla, we had drinks at a few times but never ate here. Pizzeria Francesco not open during the day,, cmon man it’s pizza, open the doors. Canters Deli,…over priced lunchmeat does not excite me either. Steak house, was always empty. That’s a sign Kahunaville.. our waitress did not want to be there. A real [-]. We arrived at 9:30 pm, kitchen closes at 10 pm. This does not make sense. Every table was eating at 9:30, even the bar. This is all nighter Vegas right ? Food was ok, drinks not good. Don’t get fooled by the free margarita coupons. Has no alcohol in it and WAY too much sugar. I took one sip and left it there. The bartenders would crank the music up and dance on the bar when Mystere theater patrons were leaving the theater to get peoples attention. It is next door. We were going to eat and have drinks there after the show one night, but the music was soooooooo loud it hurt and you could not have a conversation, the waitress could not hear you. What good is that ? I didn’t know they only did t his for 10 min then stopped. It deterred us from going there that night. What a bunch of morons. Oh we earned a comp for the breakfast buffet. Small variety for a buffet to start and The food did not taste very good. They put the desserts way on the other side in a corner where you can’t see it. The omelets bar only had 1 person working it and there was a huge line and wait for omelets. There are better managed buffets out there One evening after a show we decided to sit and have drinks in the Breeze bar. DH ordered a round of drinks and paid for it with a one hundred dollar bill that he obtained FROM A TRASURE ISLAND ticket redemption kiosk in the casino. The bartender stated it was counterfeit. He called security and told us not to leave the area with an attitude as if we were criminals. Casino manager came to speak with us and said she was not familiar with this type situation she did not know what would happen next. She said for us to wait for Security to come and talk to us. We told her we obtained the bill FROM THE CASINO. DH cashed in his winnings receipt and the $100 bill came out of the TREASURE ISLAND cash machine that morning. Then instead of sitting in TI bar enjoying drinks, we were discussing for a half hour the one hundred dollar bill that was confiscated and how are we going to get it back and what are they going to do to us if it is counterfeit even if it was passed to us FROM THEIR OWN casino ? Finally security came to inform us that it was just an old bill that did not have markings the IDIOT BARTENDER was looking for, NOT COUNTERFEIT and gave it back. It was printed before 1986 and the bartender was confused. Then security left. No one came by to apologize or anything.. I should have gone to the manager on this, but again I did not want to waste vacation time complaining. We were going nonstop and didn’t have time. Dealers are RUDE at Treasure Island. DH was playing black jack and he did not respond exactly the way the dealer expected. Instead of the dealer giving a basic, diplomatic clarification, he condescendingly told him “I can read your mind, you have to….” We never played cards there after that and made it a point not to gamble there. I had the do not disturb sign on our door. The maid still decided to enter the room, did not bother to knock, a rude intrusion! No privacy here. After I informed her that morning that I did not need the room cleaned or did not need towels or any other supply. I had just changed my clothes and went to the bathroom. It would have been embarrassing if she came in about 3 seconds earlier. Then she had the nerve to say to me “oh you are quick, you are back early “. She had no business in the room, there was no emergency for her to enter the room. The location was ok, This is at the very end of the strip where the decent hotels start. To the left is FSM and right is the strip. I would have liked to be more in the middle. This place has very tacky, sleazy business practices to rape their customers of every dime they can. It is so transparent. They emailed me a questionnaire about the hotel and comments about 1 week later. I gave them this and never heard from anyone. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN !!!!!!!My husband & myself flew in for a 3 night stopover on our way home from 7 weeks in Thailand. We stayed in hotels from 3 star through to 5 star. We were not sure what to expect after reading the previous reviews but thought being so new and for 3 nights it should be fine. Check-in was quick, luggage at our room before we were. No problems getting the lift with-in a few minutes during our whole stay. First impression of the room was good, we knew it would be small but the bathroom is smaller than small. Ok for us as we were both able to fit through the tiny shower doorway, but if you are a larger person you wouldn't have a hope. Good blockout on the curtains. Good quality linens, and there was all the normal bathroom toiletries right down to a toothbrush. But that's where the good ended. We were not told where the breakfast room was, and there was no compendium to tell you anything about the hotel. Apparently, according to their website, there is a restaurant and room service.???? We found the restauant, only from the writting next to button 4 in the lift, but it was never open when ever we tried to go to it. Our room was serviced at 4.30pm on the first day, on the second day they came to do it at 7pm, we opted to just take the two new waters and two new teabags & fresh towels and left it at that. BUT he very worst thing is there is absolutlely NO sound-proofing at all. There is a doorbell on everey door which I have never encountered before. The hotel has 880 rooms, when we were there (last week July), we think 800 of them were full of children & teenagers. The noise was incredible, running up and down the halls, yelling out to each other, ringing of doorbells & the noise from the rooms either side of you. We had no sleep at all on the first night dispite resorting to sleeping tablets. We returned to the hotel for our second night in the late afternoon and by 9pm we could not stand the noise any longer and went to reception to see if we could request a room change. The young gentleman at reception was lovely, and did not even hesitate to change us to a hopefully quieter floor. We were moved to the eighth floor where there was carpeting in the hallways which did help to muffle some of the noise. Our safe didn't work and emitted a continual beep, the staff came promptly to see if they could fix it, but they were not able to, so the batteries had to be removed so we didn't have to listen to it beep all night. Not having the safe wasn't a huge drama as we don't travel with many valuables and reception looked after these while we were out of a day. It was quieter & we got some sleep on the second night though again had to resort to sleeping tablets. The third night was just a repeat of the first. There are bus load after bus load of groups being dropped off, nearly every time we went through reception another lot were arriving or leaving. We found the staff at the reception desk to be helpfull and they were handling a lot of complaints, which they did very well. The porter did try and charge us for bringing our luggage down, but we were not advised there was a charge nor as I said is it written anywhere. We were given a slightly extended checkout till 2pm as we had a late night flight. We left our luggage and went out for a while as our flight wasn't until 9pm. When we returned we asked where we could change clothing for our return to our cold home and were told we could use the facilities on the fourth floor at the gym & pool. These "facilities" were a disabled toilet which was locked. 6 toilets, 4 of which were locked and the one that was vacant was small and not clean. We opted to take turns to, use one of the two shower stalls that was not being used to change in. Fortunatley it was dry and sllightly bigger than the toilets. The chef was chaning in the toilets too, so they obviously don't have rooms for staff to use either. The gym is tiny with no change rooms at all. The hotel is very convieniently located as has been said before, and yes there is a food court underneath, but it is exactly that, not a restaurant, food was tastey, but not hot unless you got one of the soups that were constantly boiling, and it is very noisey in side. There is no restaurant nearby that we could find, nor could the staff tell us of any. So to sum it up we won't be back. If they had sound proofed to some degree it may have been a good place, so it's a pity really. Sorry but I can only say if you've booked & want to chance it, go armed with plenty of sleeping pills & earplugs! We would have been really upset if we had paid their full price, but we had booked in there opening specials, but it still wasn't worth that.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Day 1: When we first arrived at the hotel at 9:30 am and we were greeted by a friendly staff who offered us glass of champagne, a warm cloth to freshen up and all the information about the wonderful hotel including the safe "rental". I was a little surprised when she said that there would be a $3/day rental charge for the safe. But nonetheless I agree and offered up my credit card for incidentals, she said it was not necessary that we would settle up at checkout (remember this, it becomes very important later). This took about 20-25 mins to get checked in, towel cards issued and arm bands put on. All in all the check in process was quick and painless for me....but my kids (ages 5 and 7, first trip to Mexico) were having fit to get into their swim suits and get in the pool . The "changing room" was the lobby's public restroom, that was under construction and not available. So we were instructed to use the pool side public restroom. We went to the restroom and it was naturally wet and seem unsanitary so we asked for our towels (remember the towel cards at check in). They staff informed us that they were out of towels, so we went back to the front desk and were again met with friendly enough people but they were not able to offer any solutions to our problems. So we went back to the pool and my kids just swam in their travel clothes for a while. We then went back to the front desk to check on our rooms (11:00) and we got in some trouble for tracking in water....remember we had no towels! We finally decide to dig in our luggage and dry the kids off with my shirt and let them change in the luggage closet...we got in trouble for that as well. We went back to the pool and the wife and i sat at the swim up bar to get a drink to calm the nerves while the kids swam...and we sat....and we sat....and we sat....and we sat....not a drink between the two of us....there is very little service at the swim up bar! So the nerves are still a little bit on edge. Around 2:00 we were assigned our room (2428)...we had a top floor room with an amazing view of palm tree!! Seriously you couldn't see past the tree! We could see and hear the pool and the ocean we just couldn't see them. We finally settled in and began to realize that our room was warm/hot and didn't seem to getting any cooler...we did figure out the secret is to keep the closet doors closed, the bathroom doors closed and the curtains drawn...all day and night...and that seemed to make it bearable...just not comfortable...especially in the bathroom. And before i forget be sure and go see Carlos (if you travel with Lomis Travel). he will chew you out if you don't...I know this from experience...and that is what you want while you are on vacation is a butt chewing from our travel rep. Day 2: All day at the pool....friendly pool/entertainment staff...nothing exciting. Day 3: I took the wife and kids to Xcaret for the day...too hot and too much walking for me and my team...you can decide for yourself ($207 USD for the 4 of us). We stopped back at the hotel grabbed a quick shower and head back to town for dinner (since the food at the hotel is not that good). We returned to the hotel at around 11:00 in the evening and began our routine of showers, teeth brushing and taking medicine when we noticed that staff had not replaced bottled in the frig. This was strange since we were at an all inclusive resort. I decided to go to the front desk and just get one there (thinking it would be 30second deal). I informed Salvador that the staff had not restocked our frig asked if i could get a bottle of water...he informed me that only the first day's water was free and any additional water or soft drinks were $2.50 each. I told him that there must be a mistake that we had paid for and "all inclusive" package and he assured me that i was not entitled to any free water and if i wanted a bottle of water that i would have to pay for it. I said whatever and offered to let him just charge it to my room. He said that since i did not have a credit card on file that he would not be able to give me bottle of water (remember the credit card at the beginning of the story)? I told him that i did not have any cash or credit cards on my person (since i had showered and changed in my PJ's) that they were in my room and he could just make a note and i would settle up with them at check out tomorrow (like i was going to do with the safe)...he told me to go to my room and get some form of payment he would be glad to sell me bottle of water...I told him to get me a [-] bottle of water...he told me to go get him some money and he would give me water....I all gets a little fuzzy here but i do recall telling him to go [--] himself and get me my [--] water.....and he then called security....and that's where it got ugly!!! (a full incident report in on file at the front desk if you choose to inquire about it). I will say that if it weren't for a kind professional employee named Victor who was witness to the debacle and who brought me a bottle of water to my room. If if werent for Victor then i would have most likely spent time in the Mexican jail. All this over a bottle of water!!! FYI this is my 9th time to Mexico (5 Cozumel, 3 Playa Del Carmen, 1 Cancun) and i can say that this is not the norm for customer service in Mexico. I high recommend the Real or the Grand Porto Real just down the road....its a little more expensive but it's money well spent.THEY HAVE WAITERS ON THE SIDEWALK TRYING TO PULL YOU IN WHICH MADE US SUSPICIOUS.This is a low budget hotel near downtown Miami (not near Miami Beach). I will try to attach some pictures of the room. I certainly cannot recommend this hotel, although for single guys or maybe groups of people who don't have much money, this place is better than sleeping in the gutter. I certainly would not recommend this for couples or single females unless you have a compelling need to be in this part of town and your other option is sleeping on the street. I paid $80 in Feb 2009 on short notice, but I have seen other posts with lower numbers (maybe it is seasonal?). The other option for cheap hotel in this area is the Roadway Inn, which has bigger rooms, but cost more and is noisier and crappier than the Miami Sun. Do NOT stay in the Barlington or Spanish River hotels. First the good stuff: 1) There were low levels of allergens, perhaps because the floors throughout the entire building tile instead of carpet. 2) The location is good. It is close to American Airlines Arena, Bayside Mall, and many of the government buildings and courthouse buildings. 3) There is a small diner next door, which is convenient. The guy at the counter was nice, although he did not know was decaffeinated coffee was. The diner is basically crappy but the prices are reasonable and it is open for breakfast. 4) The people at the desk were helpful with directions. 5) You can get to the hotel using Metrorail for $2 from any of these points: The Miami Amtrak station, the Miami Airport (via bus#42 to Amtrak then walk a few blocks), Ft Lauderdale airport (via Tri-rail, which is an additional $4 and connects to Metrorail). See my notes at the bottom for details. And now the not so good 1) There are no amenities: a) no alarm clock b) no hair dryer, iron, ironing board, coffee maker, microwave c) There were two bars of soap, but they were very tiny, even by hotel standards. 2) There were only a couple of the very cheap, wire hangars that were too weak to hold my wool coat (there was a cold spell in the place where I started my trip) 3) There were only 2 towels and they were small, very thin, and one had dark grey spots. There are no hand towels, wash cloths, or floor mat for the bathroom 4) There was barely any hot water on Friday morning at around 7:00 am, although I had decent hot water on Sunday. 5) There was a lot of noise outside the hotel on Friday night--mostly loud cars, car alarms, and some people talking. The single-pain windows and perhaps openings around the air conditioner offered very poor sound insulation. Surprisingly, Saturday night was pretty quiet except for some distant white noise from cars. 6) There is no weather stripping or pad around the door frame, so when guests leave at 4:00 am to catch a plane, they will probably slam the door, which echoes in the tile hallway and enters the 3/4" crack under the room door. 7) There was a new sink in my room, but no counter. 8) There was no shampoo, lotion, conditioner, coffee, tea or other such things 9) The procedures for booking the room were very odd. I had to go to themiamisunhotel.com, print a reservation form, and fax it to them with a Xerox of my driver's license and credit card (I noticed other reviews that said the same thing). 10) My room was very small, and there was "old grime" in some areas of the bathroom and many layers of sloppy paint that create nooks for dust and germs. There wasn't much "fresh grime." 11) There were no "do not disturb" signs 12) The light bulb in the lamp didn't work 13) There was a mix of guests, and only a couple appeared to be people that I didn't want in the next room. There was one normal-looking family that spoke Spanish (they were OK), one guy that I thought was homeless (I'm not sure if he was a guest or just talking to somebody in the lobby), a career party girl with a big mouth, and a baggy-panted punk. 14) The blanket was really thin and cheap, but I guess there isn't much of a need for warm blankets. I did not try the heat or AC, but there was a window air conditioner (maybe the heater was in the AC unit??). 15) The curtain did not block the light, so when the sun rises, your room will be bright (and this might make it difficult to sleep late) 16) The key is a single, metal key that any moron could duplicate. There is also a 5$ key deposit that is returned at checkout. == METRORAIL directions: From Amtrak station (which is near Miami Airport): A) If you are INSIDE the Amtrak station in Miami, exit through the main double doors and turn right. B) Walk down the block past the electric transformers that occupy almost a full city block. This is mostly an industrial area, but there are a couple houses on theleft. C) Go about 3 blocks until you see the overhead train track (it is about 2 stories above ground on stilts), D) Turn right, go one block to the train station, but PAY ATTENTION!. E) If you are going to the hotel, you want to get on the **Metrorail** buy going up TWO FLIGHTS of escalators (or elevator) and take it SOUTHBOUND. Be sure to listen to all announcements to be sure that you are going south to get to the hotel. There is a different train system that connects at the same spot, so stay awake. F) Exit the Metrorail at Government Center (101 NW 1st Street) and walk toward the big courthouse buildings to get to the hotel). Bring a map printed from maps.yahoo.com. FROM MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT: 1) You have two options for getting from the airport to the Metrorail. A) Take bus #42 which goes to the front door of the Amtrak station. B) take a cab. 2) Follow the directions above to get from Amtrak to the hotel FROM FT. LAUDERDALE AIRPORT. A) take the Tri-rail from the airport (I don't know exactly where it is, ask around--my friend took it from Ft. Lauderdale). It costs around $4. B) You will arrive at the transfer point to Metrorail. This is also a few blocks from the Amtrak station (see above) and relatively close to Miami Airport. C) Exit the Tri-Rail and go up two flights of escalators and get on the MetroRail GOING SOUTH. Listen to all announcements. D) Exit the Metrorail at Government Center (101 NW 1st Street) and walk toward the big courthouse buildings to get to the hotel). Bring a map printed from maps.yahoo.com.The room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go.We stayed at the Royal Lahaina for 4 nights and 5 days in June. I would not return! When you check in they unload your bags into the lobby and just leave them sitting around out where anybody could take anything that they want. I had my son stand with the bags while I checked in. When I checked in the girl went over with me the length of stay number of people in my room and so forth. They give you the option to pay for a package which includes parking, in-room coffee and tea for a little discounted price so I said ok to that. She then informed me that we had been upgraded to an ocean view room. When we were taken to our room it only had 1 bed and there were 3 of us (which she knew because she confirmed that on check in). So we had to go back downstairs to get another room. No other rooms were ready so we had to wait. We decided to have lunch while we waited so we put our luggage in the room of my sisterâ€™s family who was traveling with us, otherwise they would have just left it sitting out in the lobby. When we did get our room it was not ocean view but partial ocean view which was ok but it smelled like urine! Very strong! My husband complained and they said that they had no other rooms available and we would have to wait until tomorrow to change. They said that while we went to dinner they would send up housekeeping to re-clean the bathrooms but they didnâ€™t. What a horrible night. The beds were tiny and had flat-as-pancake pillows. We signed a form giving them permission to move our luggage the next day to a different room because we had plans and could not hang out at the hotel til sometime between 1:00-3:00 which is when they said that they could move us. When we returned they had moved us two doors down. The new room did not smell, had bigger beds, fluffier pillows and a brand new comforter. I wonder if they just see what youâ€™ll put up with before they give you a decent room? Anyway, I have been in better motels than this resort! The bathrooms are awful. There is a sliding door to shut off the toilet and shower area of the bathroom. Ours closed all the way at the top but there was about a 2â€� gap as you got to the bottom. The showers are disgusting! There is some kind of panel above them that the paint is chipping off and cold water drips out constantly. The bottom of the shower had a lot of chips of porcelain missing. Both the rooms and my sisters where the same way. Oh, in the first room the toilet seat did not match the toilet. It was a different color and did not fit properly. It was just an old cheap plastic one. The lighting in the bathroom was horrible to get yourself ready. Part of the wall was missing in the toilet area at the door jam. Come on, how can they not repair these things in a resort! The knobs on the closet door were disgustingly dirty as was the telephone. Yuk! My sisterâ€™s room had a iron burn mark in the rug. The entire room is not carpeted, just around the beds. Can they not afford to replace this? As others said, the elevators did smell like fish. The bar lounge smelled funny too. I might expect a bathroom like this if I picked a slum area motel that rents by the month to homeless but not from a resort. I was supposed to be on vacation for heavenâ€™s sake! The resort fee package I paid was a waste because of the dirtiness of the room I could not bring myself to use the coffee maker. Maid service never brought new glasses when they would clean, they just left the used ones on the sink. They leave water on the sink but that is not included in the fee you pay. They charge extra if you drink those. There was an area where they had cut out a big square in the wallpaper and then tried to glue it back on but it was coming unglued around the edges. While at the hotel we did over hear a number of other guests complaining to the front desk about numerous problems. Now Iâ€™ll tell you what was good just incase for some insane reason you still want to stay here. The resort is very pretty. Lovely tropical plants, golf course and beach. The lobby was very nice. You can tell when this place was first built it was really nice. The decorating in the hallways and elevator were really neat and Hawaiian. There is an excellent place to snorkel in front of the Sheraton next door. The staff was nice enough. Views out the balcony were great! It is just a shame that they have let other things run down so badly. When in the sleeping part of the room away from the bathroom, it was nice as long as you donâ€™t notice how grimey the phone is. We had no complaints about the pool or beach. Breakfast buffet was just ok. It is not bad for one day or maybe two but I would not want you to commit to eating it everyday of your stay. The dinning room was nice. I read the mixed reviews before I went and wish I would have listened to the warnings! We are used to staying in Howard Johnsons and Best Western types so I am not a Hotel Snob. But the rest of it did not make up for the filthy, gross, bathrooms. Stay somewhere else! Be sure to do the road to Hana. Get some kind of a guide when you do. We had the Hawaii for Dummies book and it told you exactly where to stop to get out of your car and walk a very short ways to see waterfalls. You can swim in them and it is neat experience. There is also a black sand beach at a park that starts with a "W" I don't remember the name at about 32 miles in that was really beautiful! Kobe's in lahaina was great for dinner. Better to make reservations though. Snorkeling at Molikini is Great! It is expensive though so if you want to save money the snorkeling infront of the Sheraton at Kaanapali beach is really really good too (free). If you do go to Hawaii, have a fantastic trip!I recently stayed at this hotel during the final weekend in July, with my friends. We had a room on the 7th floor with two queens. CHECKOUT / CHECK-IN / INITIAL IMPRESSION: The hotel seemed clean, and the staff seemed relatively knowledgeable. However, the person at the front desk took several minutes to see my name on the reservation that I had made, despite the fact that they were staring straight at it. There were multiple names on the reservation, and I was nearly told I could not check in until he finally noticed my name in big letters right on top of the reservation. Chalk that one up to being tired I suppose, I understand. Next I was informed that my debit/credit card would have an amount of 100.00 held on it for incidentals. I have never been to a hotel where this was done before -- always, there was a card on file for incidentals that would be charged as thing were taken. To automatically assume I'm going to drink 25 bottles of overpriced water over the weekend is insane. Whatever, I went with it. Needless to say, we did not use a thing, and yet my 100.00 has not been returned to my card yet. I'm still working on that (came home three days ago). Upon checkout, my card was AGAIN charged without being told until after it was charged for our parking. I had cash in my hand prepared to pay the guy, and he walked off and came back and said "Okay, we charged your card for xyz amount that you owed for parking." Fine, it's not like I couldn't afford it, but the obliviousness of the fact that I had 80.00 in hand cash and was trying to hand it to him directly was almost enough for me to want to scream. The staff is, to say the least, incredibly unhelpful and lacking any sort of politeness, tact, or apparently common sense. One night I was even carded the moment I walked in the door for my hotel key, as if they would deny me entry to my room if I wasn't currently holding one (I don't doubt for a second that they would have either). For the record I am not a teenager, I am not a suspicious looking person, and I was not drinking. So they had no possible stereotype / bias to even profile me on, as if my whole goal was to sneak into a Baltimore marriot at 2am? Please. VALUE: Prices were abhorrent here. -20 oz. sodas were nearly 3.00 at the in-hotel cafe located downstairs. -On-site parking in their garage is 26.00 per day, per vehicle, even for hotel guests. -Room rates started at about 300/night. The worst part was that for your nearly 300 a night, you don't get hardly anything. What you'll get is one king or two queens in a CONNECTED room (yes, this plays into the story later...). What else you get / don't get: -No available wi-fi or hardline internet in the rooms. You can pay 12.95 a day to recieve it in the conference / business center, but you will not be able to get that signal from the higher floors (I tried). Even the roach motel down the street from me has wi-fi...get real Marriott. Free wi-fi is only available in the "lounge" area, which is directly connected to the main entrance, elevato area, and check-in area. No walls to create any seclusion whatsoever, just a few tables and a few couches in the main lobby. -No mini fridge or ice bucket was provided. -The "beverages and ice" room actually only had ice in it...no beverages or even beverage machine to speak of. -An archaic iron and ironing board were present, but there was no microwave. -There are probably less than 25 channels on their TV (which to their credit is a large, relatively nice flat panel). -Walls and doors are paper thin, I could hear every single word people in adjoining rooms and in the hallway were saying, clearly as if they were in my hotel room. So say goodbye to privacy. -No continental breakfast is included. THE STAY: The beds were pretty comfortable and I slept very well, though the fact that I was utterly exhausted at the end of each day was probably helpful in that regard. Around 8am Saturday morning (we finally crashed around probably six hours prior) my brother and I were awoken by screams of children playing in the room next to us -- screaming to their parents "ONE TWO THREE FOUR TIME TO WAAAAKE UP" and then continually trying to open the door that connects the rooms. Thankfully after that morning they apparently checked out, as no more screaming children were heard. The fact that high dollar hotel rooms like this connect, particularly when we didn't request any sort of thing, is ridiculous to me. I shouldn't be able to hear screaming children, nor worry about them trying to open the door into my room at 8am. What if the door was unlocked? I can't blame the hotel for how other people's children act -- but I can sure blame them for the lack of noise control and access doors between rooms. OVERALL: I have stayed in high dollar, big name hotels. I have stayed in cruddy, bottom tier motels. I've stayed in everything in between. Thankfully, we are Silver (once gold) members and burned points to stay here -- because if I'd paid cash, I would be out nearly 1000 dollars plus parking to have had this awful experience. I was infuriated with how poorly this hotel was run and managed, how awful the customer service was, and how lacking in quality my room was for the level this hotel is SUPPOSED to be at. I would never ever recommend this hotel to someone, nor will I be staying there again. This was one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had, and the only part that I'm happy about is that I didn't have to pay full price for it. I wouldn't be upset if this was a 100.00 a night place. However, this is a prime example of running a cheap cruddy hotel in a decent location and charging primo dollar for it. I've stayed at other hotels in the area and this one is FAR inferior to them.Four room changes 5 reasons: Noise, filth, mice, cockroaches, bugs on linen. Room 1: Landscaper blowers start at 7 a.m. Front desk stops blowers in front, guys just move to back. Speak with front desk mgr, apologize, insists on $75 credit we did not ask for, and had the bellman move us to different room while we go to the pool. Wowed. Room 2: Pull back shower curtain to find black hand print, scores of hairs, dirty film in tub and soft, mushy leftover soap scum in soap holder. Took wet towel and wiped down floor and around toilet. Startled when flipped over towel to find it completely black and covered with various detritus and filth. Performed same check in vanity tile area. Even worse. Draped towels over bath and called to ask for Gen. Mgr. Not there. They'll have him call in morning but will send a different manager. Opened sofa bed and found linens unchanged, mouse droppings on left side of sheet, hair, and food crumbs under top sheet. Mgr Joe shows up. He doesn't say much. Photographs filthy towels in bath, looks at towels used to wipe tables, counters and bedroom furniture. Says unacceptable, makes some calls to housekeeping, gets two innocent housekeepers to start changing beds. Asks if we want to stay the 30-45 minutes it will take to clean it up. Mgr Joe given two incredulous looks. On way to third room, Mgr Joe offers to buy breakfast the next morning since we've been put out. Put out? What we will be if we find carrion chewing vultures in the next room? Inconvenienced? Room 3: It's very late now; we are exhausted and creeped out. Paranoia is around the corner. Tempers are frayed. Mgr Joe has moved us 2 doors down. He asks if room okay. Room smells good, looks clean, we say it's fine. Drop bags. Start to check everything. Bath clean, bedroom linens clean, furniture and counters wiped down, tile floors clean. Carpets not vacuumed but we can live with that. We are numb and want to sleep. Open sofa bed. We jump out of skins as something scampers off sheets and under the bed. We look down to find more mice droppings, but worse, very small blackish dots that clearly move. They appear too small to be bed bugs. Bed contains more food crumbs and hair. Rip sheet off bed and throw it outside. One of us just wants to shut the door between dividing bedroom from the "vermin room" and go to sleep before having a nervous breakdown. The other demands an immediate departure and disposal of all clothing. Big fight ensues. One leaves, one stays. One that leaves gives in and returns. Forgot the car keys. Compromise occurs. One makes midnight trip to bathroom and finds dead silverfish in toilet. It's dead, right? Pee and flush. Next morning, the other flips on light in bathroom to see roaches scatter. Catches one under plastic cup. Call front desk. Ask to speak to GM who has not called us. He's still unavailable. Front desk is appalled and moves us to a fourth room "closer to the lobby area where you should be fine." Fine? Eric the "Safety" mgr, supervisor, or whatever, appears. He could not be less interested. He pokes around. Looks at cockroach under glass like, "So what? It's not even that big". Eric seems comatose. Or maybe just bored. He says nothing. Mgr Joe is gone. Bellman arrives to move us to 4th room. Like lemmings off a cliff, we follow. Room 4: Get to room. Looks clean. However, we are veterans now. We know where to look so we open up the sofa bed. Lying there, in sweet repose, is a large yellow cookie crumb, with smaller crumbs lazily adorning its edges. Crumbs are surrounded by lustrous, ebony strands of hair. We motion bellman over to look. He looks dutifully. We ask if he would want to sleep in that bed. He shuffles his feet awkwardly and stands at attention by the TV. He doesn't know what to say. He is again summoned to see the offending crumbs and hair. He is asked again whether he would want to sleep in that bed. He looks around to see if anyone else is around and seeing no one, says, "No Way! That's gross, man." We check out. Again, I ask for GM to call me. I am assured he will. He does not and has not. That was Thursday and Friday. It is now Tuesday. A few remarks: We are Hilton Honors members and we've stayed at the Pointe well over 30 times in 20 years. We've never used Priceline but this time a friend guaranteed the best rate using his "method" and got a great deal for us. Upside is great rate. Downside is that not even God can get a refund if things go south. Ok, we learned a lesson. We are not starry-eyed conventioneers from Ohio, who have never seen a gorgeous mountain sunset or been anywhere with nine pools. Neither are we never satisfied, hotel guests from hell. Hotels are staffed with people. People are human. Nothing is perfect. Even so, in over 25 years of global travel, our stay at the Pointe earned a place on our Top 5 Worst Hotels Ever list (Romania's Hotel Razvan taking first). To Management: There is no excuse, not one, ever, to have a mouse, cockroach, or other bug infestation and fail to act or disclose it. Employees who pretend not to notice problems, or fail to report problems to managers, suggest corporate culture issues. Minimizing problems and their effect on guests is not only arrogant; it is insulting. Denying there is a problem at all, when photographs exist, everyone is looking directly at the problem (mouse droppings, wet soap mush in the tub, black filthy floors, cockroaches, etc) and when clearly, the problem is recurring, is dishonest. Failing at least to appear, act, fake, or pretend to be interested in a guest's unhappy and disgusting experience, is unconscionable. Lastly, failing to contact unhappy guests, regardless of loyalty, or whether they carry HH cards, especially when a guest specifically requests it, is a sign of utter contempt. Nota bene: An online posting that starts with a template stating "We are disappointed" or "We are saddened" or "We apologize for..." is unnecessary, and its sincerity inherently suspect. A bellman already informed us not to expect anyone to care about our nightmarish experience unless we post in Trip Advisor. Another employee told us that the GM faithfully reads the Trip Advisor reviews and responds because the reviews are public. This is the same manager who never contacted us while we were there and still has not bothered to call. When we have more time, we will post this review in other travel forums to which subscribe or of which we are members (absent any spelling and grammar errors – haste and all that). *** Note: Night bellman, a college kid, provided excellent service. He was very knowledgeable about the property and available guest service. Sadly, we do not remember his name. Second, the front desk manager and staff are true professionals. Outstanding problem solving skills, excellent service, thoughtful hosts.***We aren't hard to please. All we ask for is what you advertised and what we paid for. La Griffe Hotel was a nightmare, start to finish! Advertised as a 5-Star Hotel, we expected 4-Star as we were told the ratings were different in Europe. This hotel is barely 2 star, and due to the horrendous incidents that occurred, we are giving it a very generous 1 star, but only because there is no option for ZERO stars!!! 1. The comforters are feather filled, they have no other choice. The comforter in mine and my husbands room did not even have a duvet cover on it -- There were feathers everywhere (and we are allergic)! I pulled off the sheet that was covering it -- to find HOLES EVERYWHERE! These holes were covered with STICKERS! PAPER STICKERS! And they were all PEELING OFF REVEALING HOLES AND FEATHERS FLYING EVERYWHERE. I stopped counting at 45 holes! This is what goes against your body as you are sleeping! Rough paper stickers! I called the front desk and they barely understood what I was saying. I finally got them to take them away, but they had nothing to replace them with, other than scratchy wool blankets, which we got for both our room and our kids' room. ALSO... they do not use top sheets! Only a bottom sheet! I asked for TWO SHEETS for each bed, and finally got them, only to find the next day, the maids had removed them along with the blankets.!! So on day two, we had to go through the entire process of getting blankets and sheets again, and only ended up getting 2 blankets for our kids rooms, none for ours!! For our entire 5 night stay, we slept without a comforter and in my room also without a blanket! 2. On our 2nd day, while the maids were putting on the 2nd sheet we requested, my husband and I stood in the bathroom in order to be out of their way (the rooms are SO TINY AND CRAMPED two people can't pass each other around the bed which fills the whole room - you can't even use the drawers in the closet because they can't open due to the nightstand being in front of them!). Anyway, something SMELLED... REALLY BAD! My husband opened the toilet lid to find that the MAID HAD POOPED IN OUR TOILET AND DIDN'T FLUSH IT! We were outraged, and called the front desk but of course they did nothing about that either! So at this point we had to ASK for "do not disturb signs" and put them on our door, and had to refuse maid service for the remainder of our 5 day stay -- we did NOT want them taking our sheets away again and not replacing them, and we did NOT want them defecating in our toilet and not flushing it!!!!! OTHER ISSUES WHICH MADE THIS NOT A 5 STAR ESTABLISHMENT: 1. We sent out a bunch of items to them for DRY CLEANING. We had to go ask for them the next evening as they never returned them. They said "we don't have them here, we'll go get them." 2 Hours later they brought them up... FOLDED not on hangers... and they were SOAKING WET!!! DRY CLEANING SOAKING WET???? Silk tops, ruined! We had to hang everything to dry and were without the clothes we needed for 2 more days! 2. Curtains falling off the track. 3. NO soap dish, soap scum everywhere. 4. Shower stalls in BOTH our rooms leaked and completely FLOODED the bathroom floors! 5. Mini bars practically empty. 6. TV reception unwatchable, only CNN in English. 7. NO TISSUES! THEY DO NOT STOCK TISSUES IN YOUR ROOM AT ALL! 8. NO SPARE TOILET TISSUE! RAN OUT AND HAD TO ASK FOR IT. 9. Our room was across the hall from the maids station/room -- they were CONSTANTLY noisy and loud laughing and talking early in the morning and late at night. 10. Room Service - the food was ICE COLD.. cold burgers, cold french fries. 11. CLEANLINESS: While basically clean looking on the surface... look under your bed! In both of our rooms it was completely dusty and filled with feathers from the leaking comforters! 12. INTERNET: They charge 10 euro per day per computer. You have to go down to the desk to get a code. The code will run out in a few minutes - you have to go get another one... we went through this so many times it was ridiculous! 13. I left a small jewelry pouch behind and realized it after I got to the airport. Although they agreed to send it to me, they made me give them my credit card number to pay for it. I've had several other hotels who ship it to you for free... it arrived yesterday, and I am missing one of my gold earrings. 14. STAFF: The front desk staff was very unhelpful, and mostly rude. They acted as though they didn't understand a word we said, and the most they did for us was say: "The manager isn't here, we'll tell him tomorrow." One of the doormen on our last day - we told him we needed a station wagon to take 4 people and 4 suitcases to the airport... he called for one and it arrived -- a mini car! We were late getting to the airport! The front desk manager agreed to drop our extra charges, for the internet and mini bar, but they would not compensate us for one room which we felt would have been fair due to the MAIDS POOPING IN OUR ROOM, having no covers and sheets on our bed for 5 days, having to deal with floods each morning from the shower, etc. etc. etc.!!! THE ONLY SAVING GRACE for our vacation in Rome was JOSEPH, the DOORMAN!! What a WONDERFUL knowledgeable and KIND man he is! Joseph made us feel special, he would recommend a good restaurant and call ahead to let them know we were coming. He completely catered to our needs. He made us smile when we felt like crying over how we were treated by this horrible hotel.do not go to this hotel Date of Service Dec 14-21Place: Barcel贸 Dominican Beach Resort, Punta CanaI found that the hotel not to be of sufficient standards to be ranked as a five star hotel, based upon the quality of service and the failure to deal with concerns and problems as they arose. My first concern was the noisiness, and lack of privacy of my first room Although this was close to the beach which was lovely, I asked for a different location as the room was not private (people could look straight into my room as they walked along the path, unless I closed the curtains completely) and most of all it was extremely noisy. Every day Pellicano Watersports would play loud music piped through loudspeakers for no apparent reason. I complained and they said I had to speak to their manager to stop this practice. This was also the outfit which I booked my scuba through and they were more than unhelpful for a number of other reasons. The staff went on strike for a day鈥檚 excursion for which I was booked to make 2 dives鈥攁pparently because the hotel had not paid the staff. They also took me out in a whaleboat without a ladder for a dive in which I ended up extremely seasick and with vertigo, and for which I had to consult a doctor at the hotel. One of the staff members also tried to charge me 15% above the rate he had quoted me verbally and it was only when I noticed the discrepancy that the initial charge was voided and recharged correctly. This speaks to a patter of disorganization, dishonesty and unprofessonalism. My room also lacked a bottle opener which meant I could use no items from the mini bar. I complained about this to the maintenance staff but never received an opener. I also complained about the fact that there were no working light bulbs outside my room which made it both dangerous and unsafe for a person after hours. I had to feel my way in pitch dark just to find my room. My request for a light bulb was rectified. I had a lumpy bed (I later discovered the entire hotel had ancient beds with large dips, over which they simply placed mattress pads to cover the dips.) These were extremely uncomfortable and not appropriate for a five star hotel.In general Barcelo was unsatisfactory because of 1) poor quality of the beds2) continuous noise (everywhere on the hotel there was piped music which was far from restful. Repeatedly playing frenetic Christmas carols around the lobby area and restaurant, and throughout the landscaped gardens transformed a beautiful location into a noisy nightmare. After complaining about the noise, I was transferred to Room 5409, which was no quieter, as I was woken every afternoon by music on the beach and various disco parties.3) poor quality food and service: Not up to the standards I had come to expect with Apple Vacations and my previous experience with the Grand Sirenis ( admittedly a five not four star apple rating).Ironically after complaining to Apple about the service , I found the door ajar to my room (I had not left it open). Fortunately nothing had been stolen. I reported this immediately, and later staff appeared to fix the door which blew open in the wind. It was very lucky that nothing was stolen, as I had a computer in my room which could not fit into the room safe.I spent more time than I wanted to on my holiday complaining about these problems, and in the end I just couldn鈥檛 wait to leave. When I first checked in, I was told I had to wait 4 hours to get my room, and when I asked to place my computer in the hotel safe, so I could go and eat and swim, I was told that there were no such facilities to place the computer. Since when does a hotel not have a safe for guests to use besides those in the rooms? I never received a report back as to why my room was open, and whose fault it was. I never received so much as an apology for this incident. Repeatedly staff would burst into my room when I was changing barely pausing after the initial knock. The TV remote did not work in the first room and was missing in the second room. My telephone was broken in my first room, and I actually repaired it in the end because I was told I would have to wait several days for a technician to come. (Frayed wire was the problem which led to a faulty connection). A half day excursion to a coffee plantation which I booked through Apple was cancelled and although Apple sent me notification the night before I never received it because it was sent to the wrong room. As a result I sat there for several hours waiting for a tour which never came, and the day was wasted when I could have taken an excursion with a different company. The problems continued even as I was checking out, with an unhelpful staff member at the front desk telling me they required exact cash to pay for my telephone bill (which I had to then go off and get).I have had a great deal of travel experience, and I know no place is perfect. The key is rectifying a problem promptly and courteously when an issue arises, and I did not find that Barcelo did this. A simple apology and knocking a trvial amount off the bill like my $ 10 phone charge would probably have been enough for me to be happy. Trivial things like missing TV remotes and bottle openers start to become exasperating when you have to chase around people to get replacements or service, when you are supposed to be concentrating on your holiday and free time, not waiting in long lines to speak to guest services or the front desk. While some of the issues were trivial,a number were very serious (e.g. my door being open and the unprofessional staff of The Pellicano Water sports).Kirsten ThompsonThanks to my friend "WizOfOzCP" which quickly got our warning sent out on Tripadvisor. My wife and I visited the Hotel Romanico Palace from 15 November 2011 to 22 November 2011. This was an extremely horrible experience and I would therefore like to warn others against using Hotel Romanico Palace. We arrived at the hotel late afternoon on 15 November and was assigned room "118 of the hotel employees, who also made us clear that the hotel room safe was safe to use. We were at a four star hotel, so we chose to follow the hotel instructions. This would prove to be extremely unwise. As we left the hotel room on November 16, we had placed our valuables there among 700EU, before we left the room I entered my pin code no indication either in the passport or elsewhere, while locked my wife both closets, which hotel Safe is located. When we came back again towards the evening, my wife noticed that the closets were not locked anymore, we wondered what caused the hotel staff would have to open our closets. But as things in the closets so untouched out, it was at our amazement. We had not yet opened our safe. Next morning on November 17th when we would leave the room, we opened the hotel safe box and quickly realized that 300EU missing from our wallet. As we remember our amazement from the evening before, we were aware that someone had gained access to our hotel safe and a stolen 300EU. When something like that happens you will always be in doubt, maybe you have made a mistake or you have forgotten to locked the safe box, because you are on a four stars hotel, there is video surveillance and electric door control. If there had been thieves in our hotel room, the reception would let us know. ect. We decided not to say anything at the reception, but to take all our valuables with us, and before we left the room, we mark the hotel safe box so that we outside could see if anyone had been inside the box while we were away from the hotel room. We locked our closets and marked them so it was possible to see if the closets had been opened. When we got back in the evening, we could fast see that our closets had been opened, while we were marking the hotel safe box had been broken. There was no doubt their had been thieves at our hotel room. We approached the front desk and told about the theft, which promised to control the electric door locks and video surveillance. At the same time the receptionist informed that this had never happened before in the hotel, and that all employees were trusted employee who had been there for many years. Yet I decided to "google" hotel on the internet, and soon I found here on Tripadvisor a similar incident in March 2010 when an American family had been stolen 200USD. I took my computer with me down to reception and asked them to explain why they not informed about this review on Tripadvisor. The receptionist told me that he knew nothing about the incident, and after reading it, shaking his head and laughed. I told the receptionist that I could not see anything funny in being robbed when you were a guest at Hotel Romanico Palace, and that their safety should be taken seriously. Then the receptionist offered me a cup of coffee in the hotel bar, which I refused. Subsequently day on November 18 we went to the police to report the thieves. In addition to notification and a receipt, the police would not do anything in the case, we called the police to visit the Hotel Romanico Palace, but the distance to the hotel at 50m seemed insurmountable for the officer. When we got back to the hotel we asked the front desk how it went with the investigation. The receptionist who was the same I had spoken with the evening before, could tell that there was nothing to see on video surveillance as well as on the electronic door lock. So no one had been in our room besides cleaning staff. And it was not possible to open the hotel safe box without the pin code which I had used. Hotel Romanico Palace had no boss (manager) key for the hotel safe box and therefore had no access to the hotel safe box: told the receptionist. In that case of the American family, where the hotel receptionist had used a manager key for the hotel safe box, could not be true. It was therefore concluded that my wife and I stood there and lied and we could not have been robbed. My augment with evidence that someone from the hotel had acquired departure for the hotel safe box would not fit. Simultaneously, reception's ability to understand english very bad, actually it was no longer possible to communicate understandably with the reception. The next day when we stayed at the hotel, I tried to obtain further information about Hotel Romanico Palace, hotel safe box, I found that on the back of the safe box was given a service code COD # 20696, as a handheld terminal or a PC via a USB connector on the underside of the keypad on the safe box, could provided access to the SETUP menu on the safe box, and thereby provided access to the information entered. The "Italian" reception at the hotel could tell that this was only used by the company that had service on the hotel safe box, and that they had no sense of anything like that. And this was it indeed be true when they say so. After I came back from Rome, I found this on Youtube, it proves that at 50 Laptop Safe box, only need a paper clip, a 9 volt battery, and 2 min, then the box emptied of value. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Q3aDy-BUc Apart from all hassles with Hotel Romanico Palace, had my wife and I a wonderful trip to Rome, a few pleasant days in each other's company with beautiful weather and fun. It remains only to ask yourselves: Why do guests on Hotel Romanico Palace get their money stolen. ? Why have Hotel Romanico Palace none trust to the complaints ? Why should hotel Romanico Palace lie of past events. ? Why was it not possible to see the video surveillance at the hotel. ? Why was it not possible to see the printout from the electronic door lock at the hotel. ? Why do we repeatedly see the receptionist speak in walkie-talkie outside the hotel. ? Why do thieves not only take 20EU 50EU and it will probably never be discover, or maybe that is the reason why there have been so few complaints. ? I must commend the cleaning, it was good, you can say too good. I really can not recommend visiting Hotel Romanico Palace, we welcome all our holidays with our wife, family, children and friends. A nightmare with theft from a hotel safe, a hotel and police are neglecting your review. That movie can we see Saturday night on the television. The holiday must be peaceful and romantic. "Travelling is living" Quote: Hans Christian Andersen (H.C Andersen anno 1855) Martin (Denmark)The worst though was the taste.I was just in New York for a 2 day interview so I wanted to stay someplace inexpensive yet not too far away from the office I had to go to (near Grand Central). My mother and I looked online and saw that Hotel Pennsylvania had a reasonable rate and was in a good location. I arrived at the hotel late Monday night and stepped out of the cab into a rather motley mix of people, some not so appealing looking. But I chalked that up to the area probably being a hangout for teenagers and whatnot. I walked into the lobby and it was the same thing. I wasn't worried, however. Sure there were more random people walking around the hotel than I was used to, but it was near a station after all. Most hotels would ask non-patrons and loiterers to leave... but I shrugged it off. In the midst of my check in, a man came up to the front desk yelling about some problem that was supposed to have been resolved already. He had an unfamiliar accent so I couldn't make out just what the issue was. I did notice, however, that the front desk girl conducted herself rather unprofessionally. But I figured it was late so she was probably tired and frustrated by now. I wrote it off. I headed for the elevators where I had to show my room key before I could even enter the elevator area. This was the point where I actually first braced myself. While this sounds like a comforting security measure, I've been to hundreds of hotels all around the world and have never seen such a practice. I found myself a little wary wondering why they would need such a precaution. Maybe the area wasn't as safe as Time Square where I usually stay. When I stepped off the elevator and onto the 4th floor, I knew with a sinking feeling that my time there would not be pleasant. I was hit with a rush of stale cigarette smoke. Apparently my non-smoking room was on a smoking floor which rather negated its efficacy. The hall carpet looked as though its original color was buried underneath quite a few layers of dirt and grime. Stains large and small were everywhere. I was a little frightened of seeing so many stains considering that the lighting was inordinately dim and further hampered by a mist of smoke. If that's what I could see, how much was I missing? Many of the directional signs to the rooms where hand drawn as quite a few of the signs had fallen off probably long ago. What was even more fun for me, there were no signs to my room at all. I had to roam the dark, dank hallway aimlessly. Fortunately I found it just before I was about to go downstairs to complain. Many of the doors to the rooms were covered with some sort of green, plastic decoration. It's hard to describe, but they were obviously old and tattered. Quite a few of the doors were missing them and the ones that were still hanging often had holes. I arrived in my room only to find that my carpet was filthier than the carpet in the hallways. So filthy was it that I never took off my shoes. There was a double bed with an obviously worn bedspread, an armchair about 30 years old that looked as though it had never been cleaned in all that time, and a desk that looked only a few years old but that had a chair whose cushion was already covered in stains. As I walked in I immediately smelled the musky odor of mold, and soon I found ONE of its sources. There was a little mini-fridge of the floor with black mold visible on the outside of it. I was horrified. I timidly entered the bathroom hoping for a bright spot but afraid of something worse. The towels and washclothes were folded on what looked like the type of bathroom shelving you'd find in a high school locker room. The problem was that the holes that were part of the shelving design, probably meant to prevent water buildup, were full of rust and dirt. Apparently noone at this hotel had ever heard of LYSOL (fortunately I had and came armed with a bottle). I read one review where someone walked into a room there and it reeked of bleach, they were appalled. Me, I only wish I'd had the smell of bleach in my room. I gingerly pulled back the shower curtain to spray the area with Lysol, only to find that no amount of Lysol would convince me to bathe myself in such a place. There was no plug for the drain so I could clearly see the corroded, rusted, and dirt encrusted area around and inside it. The enamel on the tub was cracked and peeling in many places, creating partially opened crevices where it was impossible to clean. Maybe if the whole thing had been soaked in pure bleach..... From what I saw, either the tub wasn't cleaned after the last guest (or few guests) or whoever cleaned it didn't know how to do their job. To be fair, maybe they were just as grossed out as I was a preferred to avoid it. All I wanted to do was survive till morning when I could find other accommodations. I went to the window to close the curtains (my room looked into another room) and I happened to glance down at the ancient fan/heater attached to the wall. To my horror and nausea even now, the vent was filled with mold, grime, dirt and only the Lord knows what else. It was black with layer upon layer of filth. Absolutely disgusting and I'm sure a health hazard and code violation of some sort. It's just as well the window was stuck and didn't close because I felt I would rather freeze all night than even let my pinky touch the dial on that contraption. And I did. I spent a restless night hearing people come down the fire escape through my hopelessly ajar window. I'll try to cut this longwinded story short on only mention in passing things like the stains on the inside of the bedspread, the filthy ironing board, the lack of a bolt lock on the door, and the fleas. Needless to say I hightailed it out of there early in the morning. I checked out a couple of housekeeping carts on my way out and noticed that there were no cleaning products whatsoever. There were only refills of toilet paper and changes of linen. Actually, this place was such that you had to put a sign on your door saying that you wanted them to clean the room to get service at all. They have a $50 early check out fee that got waived for me, which is just as well for them as I was appalled enough to make my complaints known which is something I'm usually loathe to do. I ended up staying at the Comfort Inn on 46th St. which turned out to be $10 cheaper a night, almost on the corner of Times Square, closer to my interview, and CLEAN. Granted, I had just left hell so anything else felt like heaven. I know others have mentioned that their in the midst of renovating and that some of the rooms are ok. But as for me, I wouldn't take the risk. Friends don't let friends stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.I don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable.Swissotel this is a waste of MY PRECIOUS time. You have already wasted too much of it and too much of my cash BUT i must warn others of the Swissotel Merchant Court. I do not know what SWISSOTEL stands for but it may be appropriate for the Hotel to be called SWISS LEMON. We spent 3 nights at Swissotel Merchant Court. The first on the 24th was in room 570. The next 2 night we moved to Room 586. Another nightmare. Before i start the Hotel Management wherever they are based do not care about the Customer/Client experience. Your WINDOWS ARE NOT DOUBLE GLAZED. You may as well be on top or next to a Freeway or Disco. The noise is a nightmare. I read a review NOW from other Patrons 1 year ago about the Noise problem. You have done nothing. What has the Hotel done to improve the comfort of the Patron from external noise on the street from their windows? NOTHING. Because the Windows are thin. NOT Double glazed.Its Outrageous. I have looked at 20 websites at the price of this Hotel. It is anywhere from $250-$350 a night. That is a TON of money. The Hotel is skimping on doing this. Saving money Swissotel service out the window. Thanks we had 3 SLEEPLESS nights. The noise was HORRIFIC until 5-6am and then forced ourselves to get up. Shame on Swissotel. Our first night we arrived late and as soon as we turned the Water on under the sink the Water pipe was leaking BADLY. In know time the water made its way to our feet and accross the other side of the Bathroom. A HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE. The Hotel staff at reception said it was the first they heard of it. Really? It was as if someone drilled a hole in the bottom of the pipe with a drill and all the water ended up on the floor. But wait there is more. A absolutely stupid Design issue. Water water everywhere again. The water pressure is not great anyway but in room 570 we showere at a trickle because the water would not flow down to the Tub and in to the sink. A lot of the water would flow around the top of the Bath Tub all the way around and flow on to the floor. So the floor was drenched and one big puddle. Also when you flushed the Water of the Toilet the Button of the flush itself which was on the wall squirted water out also. Crazy. The Hotel Slippers are really nice soaking wet. I rand the operator to speak to the Duty Mnager. The Duty Manager was not interested. I was told the DM would call back but the operator called back. You put our health and safety at risk. I explained the situation at reception because i had to go to the Lobby to tell them. The duty Manager was standing their and after i told the Hotel reception girl because duty Manager wasn't available for me i could see the Duty Manager with a long angry face shoo her off and get rid of me was the message. We changed the room the following day and used the Bathtub Water instead of using the sink because of the problem. The following day we moved to room 586. What a nightmare. The noise was Horrific. Actually the room was a smaller room also. THe Hotel reception told me a Bulldust story about the room having a better view. Are you serious. I was looking in to Buildings close by. You have NO EXCUSE SWISSOTEL not to have double glazed windows. The outside of the Hotel, that is whatever your facing from your room is extremely noisy. This is a very busy Hotel. I have never seen so much activity. The Hotel is making BIG BUCKS but a thin pane of glass separating your room from the street. I would not have given $10 for this room when you are POUNDED By noise and other problems. Also the Breakfast at the Hotels main Buffet breakfast room is SO SO BUSY. The Design is outrageous. But this is Swissotel. Actions speak louder than words. "Bums on Seats" "Bums on Beds" is really the swissotel logo. Quality 00000000000. The Food area of the restaurant is tightly packed and yes you have to wait in lines for many things because of the stupid designs. You can see everything is crammed together to get more Sheep, OOPS i mean Patrons in. The people working the tables are good at their job in the restaurant but i cannot blame them they cannot even crack a smile. After observing them working their backside off, with obviously not enough staff i don't blame them. The variety in the Restaurant Buffet is small and the similar for the 3 days. CONCIERGE. The night Concierge forget it. I asked politely about transport. The concierge had LOOOOOONG angry faces and they were trying to push some kind of private Car/Limousine. Commision Boys? Just the Boys working during the day, particular the young boy sorry i forget your name i remember him from checking in was very nice. On check in and check out. I wrote an appreciation card for him. I was praying to run in to the General Manager. I had asked for him but ofcourse you are too busy.The vacation from Hell Look, I don't want to seem like all we did was complain to these people, but that was just about the only thing my child, my wife and me could do about his hotels behavoir. We strongly do not recomend this hotel to anyone! We arrived around 6 p.m. at the hotel and arrived at our room at 6:30 p.m. to find people still there, not fully packed, and the room was a mess. The hotel was making extra money by allowing guests to stay later for a price, even though we were due in at about 4:30- 5:00. We called to the front desk for a maid three times, before one came. We were upset because we were tired, hot, and hungry and it looked like we couldnt relax or have a clean room for awhile.We went to the front desk and told them that one woman wouldnt be able to clean, since it was so filthy and asked if they had another room available. The assistant manager said I was arguing with him, when there was no argument, just a complaint about service. Another worker behind the desk offered us another room. We said we will eat first and then look at the room, and leave our luggage in the first room. The asst. manager said he understood and would do that. The restaurant and front desk are 25 feet away from each other. When we came back our luggage was at the front desk. The asst. manager said, Oh, so you are going to another hotel? He was being arrogant. I reminded him of our conversation. He laughed. We went to see the other room. There in the bathtub we found a huge dead roach. I told the bell boy to get the roach. I left the bathroom, he went in. My daughter went to see the roach and saw him put it in his pocket. He came out and said there was no roach. We were so tired we stayed in that room with the musty smell and noisey air conditioner ``` at this supposedly five star hotel. We had something stolen from our room, filled out a security report and nothing was evr done about it. In fact they said that we lost our belongings, not that it was stolen out of the room. We spent the whole vacation defending ohe asst. manager said- Why do you expect us to pay for something that you lost. My wife jumped out of her chair and approached the desk. She said our items were in the locked room and where taken. They treated us like we were lying. He said, laughing, If the items were stolen why didnt you call the police. Go ahead call the police. He knew we were leaving shortly. He said why didnt you go to the manager. I said because you told me to fill out a report with security and wait. Also, I was waiting for an important fax to come in, I notified the front desk of the fact, I gave them my name as it appears on the fax and my artistic name. The fax was sitting there for two days. I missed the appointment, and the opportunity.Also, every single day they charged us for the mini bar, we never took anything from the bar, just used it to keep our water cold which was free bottled water from the outside bars . We even told them to lock it, we didnt want it. One worker behind the desk said they do it to everyone just ignore it, they see childrens clothes and shoes they charge candy . They finally wrote off everything but one bottle of Evian. It was stressful to constantly go through one problem after the other and being called a liar. The asst. manager acted like he was doing us a favor by taking off the mini bar bill. They had such a terrible attitude.The transportation from the main house to the rooms, restaurants, shops in the large complex, that looked like golf carts, burned diesel fuel, or at least smelled like it, made us sick every day. Not like in Puerto Rico where they run on electric. They said that all water sports were included but didnt mention they only had 5 boogie boards and you could only have it for an hour and if you didnt return it in time a charge would be billed to your room, also the catamaran had to be back in half an hour. Beer bottles were allowed in the main pool where we swam and we constantly were watching to see if anybody broke any bottles in the pool. . Also there were some people who wereol the mans girlfriend put her breast in his mouth and said he needed to be breast fed not bottle fed. So we reminded them that they were in public, we had an 11 year old daughter there, and there were other children there, and could they go back to the room and continue. All in all it was a terrible experience and we got the feeling they did not like Americans. We have traveled in many countries and have never been treated like this.P.S.: We have read everyone elses comments about this hotel and we don't think that some people should be talking about other people's ordeals like that. These comments are just trying to tell others about their horrible or excellent experience at Barvado Princess.God Bless AllWe recently stayed at this hotel (8/12/06 Room 712) in a king TCB suite and had a terrible experience. 2 adults and 1 6yr old boy. After reading some mixed reviews of this hotel, I called ahead to express some of my concerns regarding bedding, etc. Debbie, who took my call and greeted me when we arrived later that evening, was absolutely wonderful. I explained to her that I had serious problems with my spine and absolutely had to have a good mattress (no springs, good padding, etc). She told me the manager would be checking on the mattress and there would be sheets, blanket and pillows for the sofa as I requested. We checked in after 7pm. At first glance, the room was wonderful for the price we paid ($62 a night AAA Discount). We were actually considering making this a regular place to stay. The first thing we checked was that the sheets were there for the sofabed. They were not. There also was about a 1/4 roll of toilet paper and no extra pillows. My boyfriend headed down to the front desk and requested the sheets, extra pillows and a roll of tp (Once again, Debbie was great). We then headed out to Universal to catch the last night of the 360 Cinesphere, dinner and a movie (we're passholders). It was my boyfriends birthday. When we returned and settled into our room, the bad experience began. First, the room smelled musty but better than the hallway. We made the sofa bed for my 6 yr old son. It was so uncomfortable, he begged to sleep with us. So we tried puting the mattress on the floor for him. At that point we realized it wasn't the bars on the sofabed it was the mattress itself. Upon turning the sheets down on the king bed, I realized that I could feel all the springs with my hand on the edge of the mattress. When I got into the bed, there was a spring poking me in my ribs and upon looking up there was a huge water stain on the ceiling (hence the musty smell) between the bed and work area. We all slept in some strange positions that night. The toilet ran all night long, but with the door closed and the ac running you could barely hear it. This was kind of ironic considering, the water pressure wouldn't even flush a piece of toilet paper without flushing 3 times. Needless to say we were not very well rested in the morning. I called the front desk in the a.m. for a late 2 pm check out as a Hyatt Gold member. We had intended on spending the day enjoying the pool (we never did use the pool, but it looked clean and the people in it said it was nice ). The person who was at the front desk that morning could use a good lesson in customer service. She told me, "You can have the room until 1 pm, but if we need it, you'll have to clear out." I couldn't believe my ears. What kind of answer is that? We decided to get ourselves together and check out. There were 2 towels for 3 people and eventhough there was a housekeeping cart on our floor, the housekeeper was nowhere to be found for at least 2 hours. So showers for everyone were out of the question. My boyfriend and son got to shower. I called and requested a towel that never came. Then came the straw that broke the camels back so to speak. My boyfriend went in to use the bathroom and the toilet overflowed. I called the front desk immediately to inform them maintenance was needed desperately as the toilet was overflowing and I had to go to the bathroom. The front desk clerk asked me if it was overlfowing onto the floor and I replied no because I had shut off the water to the tank but it was right up to the top of the bowl and I had to go badly and didn't want to leave maintenance a "present" if you get my drift. I was assured someone would be up immediately. Fourty five minutes later, no maintenance, no towel, no shower, no toilet and I was humiliated to have to go the bathroom (poop) in a toilet that what up to the rim with waste water splashing on me but could not hold it not another second. We did see the housekeeper on the way out. He was getting a plunger from a utility room right next to ours and knocking on the wrong door. I could not have been more embarrassed or wanted to leave this hotel faster. When I got to the front desk, I was asked if everything on my bill was correct. I explained that we did not use the safe and the other issues we had with the room. The clerks response was "Sorry." That's it, just sorry. I informed her that I was very upset that I had to go home without a shower and had to poop in an overlfowing toilet. I was absolutely mortified!! Again she repeated "Sorry." I told her at that point that we won't be staying here again and I'll e-mail management about my problems since she didn't seem to give a hoot. She basically looked at me blankly and said nothing. We never got to check out the free breakfast or the pool. At this point, I just wanted to get home and take care of my hygene. Other minor things are, there was only one waste basket in the room, one in the bathroom and no liners. Keep in mind this room has a small kitchenette, seperate living, sleeping and work areas. The curtains are cut short so the ac blows behind the curtains instead of into the room and daylight floods the room at the crack of dawn. We used the deskpad from the work area on top of the ac and leaned it into the window on top of the curtains so air would blow into the room instead of between the window and the curtain. The carpet had several large white stains at the foot of the bed. We never did figure out what it was, we just side stepped that area. The refrigerator didn't keep anything cold, but the room temperature bottled water in your room was a nice touch. When we first got there I couldn't understand what all the bad reviews were about. I felt like we had found a hidden gem right across from Universal and decently priced for the area. After an overnight stay, I get what the bad reviews are about. I would not recommend this hotel.Yes it's true, New York City's hotel rooms are at times on the small side. It's also true to say that at times, even the best hotels can disappoint a jet lagged, tired guest. And yes, it's also fair to say that at times, hype can get the best of us. The Mercer was full so I tried my luck at the Soho Grand. My first and last stay at the Soho Grand combined a tiny cookie-cutter room with completely hopeless customer service and a feeling that the hype brings many first timers and few repeat customers - but as they say, "fools and money...." Location: Great for Soho, not as good as the Mercer, but most of the commercial fun in Soho and surrounds is within walking distance and travel to the hotel from the aiport is easy. The Checkin: Lets face it, the price of top-line hotel rooms has skyrocketed all over the world in the last four years. In some cases spending the money is a joy and in others you feel completely abused. After negotiating my way through the six porters and doorman all of whom were doing nothing but their hair, I entered through the dim, urban lobby and signed my life away on a room rate of a purely insulting $780 per night - good thing I have two kidneys, one is now for sale... This was only after "Sascha" (yes, how typical) had finished her flirtatious interlude with an elderly gentlemen while keeping five guests waiting in line. Conclusion: Checkin is a glamor job fielded by 'trendy', slightly clueless & unprofessional staff who are a touch on the rude side. In short, these guys are glorified cashiers ringing the till and gelling their hair. You get none of the 'chop-chop' and impressive attention to detail from more professional outfits here. The staff want to spot a celebrity so that they're 'with it' everyone else is chopped liver. So having established that the first impression was basically a joke and having my expectation for the room 'managed down' well, we headed upstairs... The Room: Fortuntely there was an area near the ceiling where a piece of rope would have supported my body weight - such was the disappointment. This room looked like somewhere depressed single dudes come to die, or where hookers come to do trade. Cheap, Best Western setup. $780 for a Deluxe King room bought us a (truly) miniscule bathroom, a dirty carpeted floor, a few cheap lamps and bedside tables, a flat screen TV that didn't work, scuffed walls and a very mean little bed. My heart sank as I surveyed the room as I was truly hoping for something special given the great location and price. Strangely, about one quarter of the floor area was taken up a closet like installation which stuck out from the wall, this enroached on the already small room and increased the sense of tight containment - alas I felt like a Soho cockroach in a glass jar. I called down to reception to see if we were given the right room category. After the phone was left on the desk for 3 minutes while the attendant checked (god knows what in that amount of time) I was informed that I had actually been upgraded. Too tired to bother with sarcasm, I hit the shower. Bathroom: Worth a special mention here as a fantastic bathroom can easily make a room and a stay that much more special. In this case, small, cheap & nasty says it all. After 5 seconds in the bathroom I had visions of a mean little hotel baron dressed as the little man with a top hat from Monopoly screaming at his managers 'cut all costs and maximize profits!'. There were no toileteries other than three little bottles of super new age "we hurt no monkeys making this product" body gel and shampoo. The toilet seat was off its hinges. No shower cap, no cotton buds, no bath slippers, only 1 little robe, no cotton wool, no comb, none of the regular things you rarely use, but find comfort in being there and make you feel just a litte bit special. On the plus side, the shower over bath had good water pressure - little problem though, if you have a high pressure shower, make sure you have drainage that can cope with it. Sure enough, after 30 seconds, the bathtub was 3/4 full and I was pretending to be a vietnamese farmer wading through monsoonal rice paddies - "Diddy Mao!" I called this one down to housekeeping and they informed me that in fact the drainage was fine, it wasn't broken and that it was normal - clearly American Idol was mesmerizing that evening as it seemed no one wanted to work for the guests (If only my Doctor could give me an over the phone checkup like this...) Oh by the way and yes you guessed it, the plastic shower curtain (yes plastic) did cling to my body and ofcourse, there was mould around the edges of it. Rather unfortunately, the power outlets DID have safety switches so dropping the hair dryer into my rice paddy bath did not kill me. Truly a shame by this point. The food: Did not trust the kitchen after seeing dirty knives and forks, very wilted lettuce and tired looking food. In short, unimaginative and awful scrapings from Soho gutters. Enough said. Concierge: A really simple job here. Concierge (yes with the by-now-customary five person queue at his/her desk) points towards the shops "over yonder". Anything else forget it. These guys just don't care and don't have a clue compared to switched on concierge desks like The Peninsula in mid town and The Mercer in Soho. Once again for this place, the emphasis on hiring young (and cheap), trendy looking staff comes wayyy ahead of hiring competent people. Conclusion: Checkout said it all to me. Once again a queue of 5 people and a 10 minute wait standing in the lobby. No "we'll be just a minute" or "thanks for waiting, how can I help you". Far from it. They just took the money and offered very little in return. This place is basically a honey trap; first timers and the curious will go and rarely return. Suckers with no appreciation for what service and quality actually is will surely come back. Value for money was non-existant, staff totally hopeless and too few of them, almost no efficiency, dirty scuffed walls and cheap looking rooms supposedly covered up by an expensive fit out downstairs and trendy kids playing "hotelier" for a few years before moving into the media or arts world. Burn this dump to the ground, collect the insurance check and build something that gives guests a feeling of excitment, value and slick prestige. The tradition of Soho has given alot of its sould away to commercialism over the years, the least such commercialism can do then is to honor such a special part of the world by attempting to enchant its guests, not pillage them. Management clearly has alot of work to do here. Oh yes, getting a cab to the airport took 45 minutes despite the six doormen/porters/concierges milling around the outside. Prognosis: Marginally preferable over a park bench and newspapers...I would get more joy smoking bad weed with the $100 bills I used to pay for this place... Where instead: Book the Mercer. Great food, Great location, relliable, big rooms, great bathrooms, smart concierge, smooth checkin/out. Can't go wrong. If The Mercer is full, try Soho House. If no joy there, try a new one called The Bowery.I booked the Park Central New York after looking at several hotels in midtown Manhattan that were close to Carnegie Hall. I booked a concierge room with a king size bed from Wednesday, June 11, 2008 - Monday, June 16, 2008. From the pictures on the website, the hotel looked comfortable and clean. When I arrived at the hotel, it seemed hot in the lobby but I figured that it was just me because I had been walking with all of my luggage. When I got to the room, I realized that it wasn't me. The air conditioning was out in the room. The fan was on in the air conditioning unit, but it was blowing out air that was room temperature (which was easily 90 degrees). I spoke with the lady at the front desk about the lack of air conditioning in my room and I asked her if I could be moved. She stated that the air conditioning was out in the entire hotel so it would do no good to be moved. I asked her when the air would be fixed and she said that she had no idea. She went on to say that the air had been out for over a week and they are just taking it day-to-day at this point. The temperature in the hotel was the topic of conversation for every guest that I encountered in the elevators and the lobby. People were checking out of this hotel as quickly as they could. Although I was uncomfortable, I tried to make the best of it and see if I could sleep in the room. Due to the high temperature and the fact that there was absolutely no air circulation, I was not able to fall asleep for hours. I lay in bed most of the night sticking to the sheets, tossing and turning in vain to find a cooler spot. By the next morning, I realized that I was not going to be able to stay in this hotel for 4 more days. So, I checked on the Wellington Hotel across the street. They had air conditioning that worked and the rooms were clean and comfortable and they were over $100 less per night than the rooms at the Park Central New York. So, I checked in at the Wellington on Thursday, June 12, 2008 and checked out from the Park Central New York on the same afternoon. When I told the gentleman at the front desk of the Park Central New York that I was checking out due to the air conditioning, he said that he understood. Then, he told me that the hotel would be charging me for my entire reservation with the exception of Sunday night. My original reservation was for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I was checking out on Thursday afternoon and the gentleman at the front desk actually said the hotel was going to charge me for 4 nights that I was not sleeping in the hotel. I couldn't believe it. I demanded to speak to the hotel manager and stated that I wasn't going to be paying. The gentleman at the front desk went back to speak with his manager and then came back to tell me that the hotel would not charge me for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. However, they were still going to charge me for Wednesday and Thursday night. I still couldn't believe that they were going to charge me for a night that I had not stayed. Then, I saw the rate that they intended to charge me. They were charging me $400/night. When I had booked the room on the website, I had booked a concierge room. The website has a promotion where you get 20% if you stay for 5 or more nights. The total reservation came to $1,700 for 5 nights. I could not understand how the hotel was now charging me $853 for just 2 nights. I told the gentleman at the front desk that I was not even given a concierge room with a king size bed as I had requested in my reservation because one was not available when I checked in at 7:30 PM on Wednesday night. He went back to speak with his manager about my rate and stated that they would take $100 off of my charge for Thursday night. So, my final bill for staying in this hotel for 1 night in a room that was not air conditioned and did not have a king size bed as reserved and was not a concierge room as reserved was $753. This is complete and total highway robbery. I would also like to mention that the wireless Internet in the room I stayed in was not working and neither were 3 out of the 5 lamps in the room. I would also like to mention that the linens on the beds were stained with what looked like dried blood. There was no bellhop to assist us with our luggage when we checked in either. The elevators were extremely slow, but the hotel has signs up that say that they are renovating the elevators. From the dust on those signs, I would say that they have been up for months. After having such a bad experience with the Park Central New York, I contacted my parents and my sister and her husband who were planning to check into the Park Central New York the next day. I told them to cancel their reservations immediately because the hotel had no air conditioning and because of the horrible service. They cancelled their reservations 24 hours before they arrived, but the Park Central New York still charged them for their entire 2-day reservations. My family is now going through the chargeback process with their banks to have these charges reversed. I would like to mention that I checked into the Wellington Hotel across the street from the Park Central New York hotel on Thursday afternoon. The room there was extremely clean and comfortable, my room was larger, had an Italian marble bathroom, a walk-in closet, an incredible view of Times Square and my total bill for a 4 night stay was only $1,052. It is hard to believe that the Park Central New York would act like they did and charge what they did when there is a better hotel that costs less money directly across the street. Frankly, I'm surprised that the Park Central New York hotel is even still in business. My advice to anyone who is planning on staying at the Park Central New York hotel is to stay at the Hotel Wellington. You'll be much more comfortable there and pay less money for your stay and there is absolutely no difference in the geographic location since the hotels are across the street from each other. Please avoid the Park Central New York hotel at all costs.Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at ALL COST!Stayed at Harrah's Feb 15-16th with my sister. Check-in seemed to go fine, we parked our car in their garage, hauled all our luggage up to our room and... the key card wouldn't work! Very annoyed we kept trying but had no luck. I walked down the hall towards the elevator and was getting ready to call the front desk when a bell boy came down the hall. I told him we had just checked in and our card wasn't working. He said 'aw man, I hope it's not the battery' checked our paperwork that showed the room we were in, used his card to let us in and told us to just let the front desk know our cards weren't working, they must not of been activated properly. So we proceded to get ourselves all settled in, unpacked some of our toiletries, used the restroom, and hung out for awhile looking at brochures and relaxing. We were in there probably 30 mins and decided it was time to 'hit the strip'. But first we need to stop by the desk and get our cards activated, no big deal right? WRONG!!! We told the man at the desk the situation and that our key wouldn't work and he asked to see my paperwork and ID which I gave to him, and he asked if the room was in my name and I said yes. He then took out this little purple strip of paper that was in the folder with the room key and asked if we knew the womans name that was on it. We said no and we had no idea what that paper was even for and I thought the womans name on it was the lady that checked me in. He explained that no it should of been my name on it and it was very strange but somehow when I checked in I was handed the wrong paper. That was why our key wouldn't work is because we were going to the wrong room. We explained that we went to the room we were told to go to and how were we to know any different! After asking us if we had been in the room long and if we had touched much and we said yes we had laid on the beds and used the restroom, he still made us move to a different room! He said he was sorry but the room we went to was registered to the lady who's name was on the paperwork and we were supposed to be in room xxx so we were going to have to move! Not only that but because it was a 'security issue' security would have to open the room for us and we had to identify our luggage before we could get it. So he called security and told them to meet us up there, gave us corrct paperwork, apologized again, etc. We hurried back up to our original room assuming security would already be there, but no one was in sight. By now our patience was extremely thin and I found it inexcuseable to have to wait for security, I picked up the house phone in the hall and angrily explained the situation and was put on hold, then security finally decided to saunter on up so I hung up. Security proceeded to watch our every move while we gathered our belongings making us feel practically like criminals. The one guy thought it was very weird we had to move to another room and told us to talk to the manager cause it wasn't right how we were treated. We agreed so we did stop by the managers desk where he apologized and comped our first night's stay. Now all that would of been good and fine if the rest of our stay had gone well, the one night free did go a long way towards making up for all our aggravation although it still stunk to start our night off with such a bad start. However we continued to have a bad experience at this hotel! The first morning there we had just got up and my sister was taking a shower when suddenly this very loud, obnoxious alarm goes off. I called the front desk and told them there was this hideous alarm going off and she asked if we were smoking and I said no and she said she'd look into it. Then we opened the door and there was a maid in the room across from us and she said everything is fine it's nothing to worry about. Ok well that's good to know, however it still took them a good 10 minutes to turn the blasted thing off, it was horrible! Later that day we came back to our room in the afternoon to relax for a little while and I went to get some ice to drink ice water and their ice machine was broken! It may seem like a minor thing but it was just one more irritation. Then to top it all off you would expect after such a bad stay to at least get good cutoomer service while checking out, but oh no not at Harrah's! I was all prepared to compain about everything that went wrong but when the woman checking us out asked how our stay was and I replied 'not very good' she just said 'oh, not very good huh'. I couldn't believe it! A normal response would of been oh I'm so sorry what was the problem? not 'oh not very good'! Then when I got my receipt I couldn't tell what had been charged to my card so I said 'can I get a total on here' and she snapped at me 'it's right there plain as day!' Well no, it was not! It had a charge with a minus sign, a room charge, the buffet we ate at Rio and then another charge with a minus sign. At the bottom where it said total it said zero. There was no total on the bill! I wanted to make darn sure the bill was correct and our one night had been comped so I went over to the manager again but he was busy with another customer. So finally another guy asked if he could help us and he explained our bill but when I said the lady checking us out had been rude he didn't respond so we just got the heck out of there! I honestly have never had such a bad experience at a hotel in my life and even if I was offered a free stay there I would hesitate to return!I have used this hotel for several years, only because it has a good location (just a ten-minute walk on main streets to the Gloucester Road tube station on the Piccadilly Line) and because it was, for some time, THE cheapest hotel you could find in London. However, for the past few years my flights have taken me to Stansted Airport rather than Heathrow, so I used a very nice guesthouse in Golders' Green. Recently I was planning a week-long trip to London for theatre and just pleasure travel. As I was flying into Heathrow this time, I thought I'd check out the options, and naturally took a look at the Cromwell Crown website. I was very pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful, very attractive site that showed pictures of rooms that were nothing like the VERY BASIC, cheap hotel (more like a 1-star hostel, really) that I had stayed at so many times before. The price had gone up (from £30-35 per night a couple of year ago to £59 per night now, for a basic single ensuite room), but given the renovations and upgrades that the website alluded to, I figured this was worth the extra money. Alas, it was not to be. When I arrived, nothing much had changed. The lobby still has the same old, tired, torn furniture it always had, with the same Pakistani family running it that I remembered from previous years. Another thing that had NOT changed, either, was the fact that, when the desk staff were checking me in, all they cared about was getting my full week's "rent" paid up front. Interestingly, they had no difficulty taking care of that! However, as it turned out, that was about the most efficient they were all week. I couldn't wait to see the renovations, but as soon as I went to the elevator, it was obvious that the Cromwell Crown really hadn't changed much except a few bits of new carpeting and higher prices. The elevator is very small (maybe two people with luggage), very slow, and very erratic. It might come, it might not. About 3 times out of 5, it eventually came, but other times, it was as if it was broken. When you asked the front desk about it, they'd just shrug and pretend they didn't understand you. My room was just like they always were: VERY basic, and small. If you're lucky, you'll get a room at the back, because if you get one at the front (facing Cromwell Road), you won't sleep without earplugs. I should also point out that there is NO airconditioning and (from what I could see) NO HEATERS in the rooms either! So don't go in August, unless sweating is something you enjoy. The web site indicates that ensuite rooms are "spacious", which is true if you consider 12 inches between the bed and the wall to be spacious. There is, as the web site promised, a "work desk" (which is really a dresser for clothes.) There was no night-stand, so I used the "desk chair" for my alarm clock. The bathroom featured a very strong smell of mold and mildew, which was not surprising given the cracks and holes in there. It was a most unpleasant smell. The "colour television" is, in fact, a TV that gets BBC 1, BBC2, ITV1, and Channel Five. Reception is spotty: some channels don't come in at all. It is definitely NOT satellite reception. The TVs are suspended from the ceiling, and there are NO remote controls in any of the rooms. I've played this game with the front desk before, but it worked the same way this time: when I asked for a remote control the first night, I was told that they would check with housekeeping the next day. When I asked again the next day, I was told that housekeeping hadn't responded to the inquiry. When I asked the third day, I was told, sorry, there aren't any remotes. There never have been: at some point I was also told that "previous guests have stolen them!" (In EVERY ROOM?) I was curious to see what the "renovated" rooms looked like, so I asked the front desk staff if I could look at one. They gave me a key, and I went to see it. First of all, I don't know where they got those photos on their web site, but they certainly are NOT rooms found in this hotel! The "renovated" rooms are slightly larger, with new laminate wood flooring, but the work quality in these rooms is really pretty shoddy, and they don't have AC or heat either! (Oh, and no remotes in them either: I checked!) The beds have the same worn, threadbare blankets, sheets and pillows as in my "normal" room, and there really aren't very many "extras in these rooms. Those "new" rooms cost from £75 per night for a single, and really are hugely overpriced for what you get. The web site is highly deceptive at best, and in many countries could be construed as false advertising. Another example of this is the claim about free WiFi throughout the hotel. This was particularly funny: I took my netbook to the "renovated room" as well as to my regular room and tried to connect: no luck at all. So I asked at the front desk: "what about the free wifi in the rooms?" I got the usual shrug. When I persisted with my question, the clerk simply said, "there isn't wifi in any of the rooms: just here in the lobby." Oh, and to use that wifi (which is very slow, similar to dial-up speed), you have to get the clerk to give you a password. It may or may not work: what you end up doing is using the hotel's private network, so be very careful about that! I skipped breakfast, but don't be fooled by that picture of the dining room either. It doesn't look like that. In conclusion, avoid this place, unless you're on a very tight budget, you're only staying one night, and you don't mind loud, tiny rooms. I had also booked the Cromwell Crown for another trip in October, but I cancelled that booking after this fiasco. Just a few yards from the hotel is the Kensington Rooms Hotel, which has VERY nice rooms for £83 pounds a night! There are a LOT of inexpensive options within ten minutes' walk of this place: do yourself a favor and stay in one of those!Our trip to Key West this weekend (Memorial Day) was planned to celebrate my mother-in-law 62nd birthday. We arrived on Saturday 05/29 before 12pm and we were quite well taken care of at check-in, except that we booked online so the check in time that was printed in our confirmation reflected 03pm and the check out at 12pm (we have the vouchers to confirm this information). We got to the "Chelsea House" a little before 12pm and the rooms we not ready. Sylvia, my mother-in-law, got mixed up thinking that the check in was at 12pm and check out at 03pm. The reception desk assistant/clerk/officer/operator Kathy (I want to make sure I don't offend anyone) was gladly outspoken to make my mother-in-law feel bad and understand that she was "really" mistaken. Sylvia asked Kathy is she spoke Spanish by any chance as she had a strong accent, maybe British? Kathy responded no, just English. You can imagine, Sylvia is native from Guatemala and her English is just about fair. It was really a silly mistake but even at that moment we WERE NOT advised that the check out time was changed from 12pm to 11am. Kathy was not very happy with the misunderstanding and was not happy with us. We signed the credit card slips and got the keys. Only after we left the hotel on Monday 05/31 that we've noticed in small letters in the bottom of the page, the check out time change. When we signed the credit card slips, the 11am time was never mentioned. We (the 3 of us) were all under the impression that the check out time was at 12pm. We even planned out the last day 05/31 around that time. Kathy got my cell phone number and in fact she called at 02:30pm and left a message on my cell phone advising that the rooms were ready. We came back to the Chelsea House around 4pm and we then brought our luggage upstairs, lots of stairs. Our room was very small. The dark blue carpet in front of our bathroom was wet, not sure if from previous guests or a water leak. We never complained. Days went by and on Monday 05/31 (check out day) we got prepared to leave the Hotel at 12pm. We never received a check out call or reminder. In fact my husband visited the front desk that morning and spoke to Bill requesting a late check out, which was denied. Again the 11am time was not mentioned. At and around 11:40am the housekeeper entered my room WITHOUT knocking which was not the proper way of entering a guest's room. You can check any Hotel operating policy. She got very scared and my small dog barked at her (yes, itâ€™s a pet's friendly hotel, few rooms only). I was in the bathroom and didn't even have the chance to apologize. She closed the door and left. Right after that, she entered my mother-in-law's room WITHOUT knocking once again. Sylvia (mother-in-law) was in fact naked in the bathroom. What kind of privacy this hotel offers? The nightmare starts now: after 15 minutes of this incident, "Chuck" the manager, was standing outside Sylvia's room knocking again, minding you that the hotel had the "vacancy" red sign hanging outside. I walk right behind him and informed that we were taking the luggage down (lots of stairs, no elevator) to complete the check out (still under the impression that was at 12pm). When we finally go to the reception, some other guests were doing the check out so we sat outside at the balcony not to disturb. "Chuck" came around and said with a weird attitude that we could go in "right after" the other guests were done with their check out. We felt that our presence there was really bothering him. So, the other guests left and we walked in. "Chuck" directed us to speak to Bill, so we though he was out of the picture. He in fact sat on his chair and watched us. When I was returning my key, Sylvia went to speak to him to inform/complain about the housekeeper entering her room without calling or knocking. Unfortunately my mother-in-law used the term "maid" instead of "housekeeper" which by no means had a derogatory meaning and is a common word used in Central America for cleaning ladies. Again, she is not fluent in English. "Chuck" overreacted and started screaming at us, with a level "10" arrogance. He stated that "he was glad to be in America where you can speak your opinions". To the Hotel guests ???? I don't think so. What kind of behavior is that ? We were insulted, mistreated and felt very bad. That ruined our trip all together and my poor mother-in-law felt terrible at her own birthday weekend. She didnâ€™t mean to offend anyone. She just wanted to make a suggestion/complaint and to inform that the shower head was blocked and the water was not running through it very well. "Chuck" advised us to get a room at the HYATT for 400.00 a night instead of staying with them again. Also that they didn't need guest "like us". What an insult. To top it of, I mentioned to Bill that we were not leaving Key West till down and that we would be back with the second key we got at check in. Again, "Chuck" shouted out loud that I would have to pay $20.00 for the missing key. Did he think I was lying? That I wanted to keep an extra key of a room that I would never visit again? Not in this life time anyway. So we did, we came back around 04:30pm, we dropped off the extra key and we finalized arrangements for the bicycles pick-up next morning which worked well with the bicycle staff, but of course, we had to swallow "Chuck" unfortunate comment that they were not on the bicycle business and that they would not do us any favors. WHAT A NIGHTMARE! ! ! So, if you want to be mistreated by "Chuck" (the manager) come and stay at THE CHELSEA HOUSE, I feel bad for the guest, staff members and the owner of this place who probably is unaware of the manager he has in place. The Sanchez family.Let me just start by saying this trip was supposed to be one to celebrate my husbands birthday (last year he was serving in Iraq for his birthday), a getaway to make up for the honeymoon we never got and a time to meet up with my extended family (including my brother who left to deploy the day after we got back). We were very much looking forward to this trip. We were staying in a two bedroom with a pullout couch with a total of three couples arriving at three different times. Arrangements had been made by my cousin (the timeshare holder) for this resort to be in my name so we could check in a day earlier than she and her spouse. Upon arrival, the hotel could not find our reservation. It took them 30 mins and lots of us and them calling around to find it. Once they finally did we were let into our room. After running around and finally getting settled in my husband and I decided to sit down and have a nice quiet night and watch a movie. We first noticed buttons were missing off the actual tv but didn't think much of it. But then when I went to pick up the remote, the batteries flew across the room because there was no back on it! I decided it wasn't that big of a deal and went on. We then proceeded to try to watch a movie only to find the dvd player was broken and making a huge loud popping noise. We called the front desk and they sent someone up. It took him running back and forth to find a new dvd player and an hour to hook it up. The next morning my husband opened the dresser to put our clothes away only to have our dresser fall apart! We again called front desk and they sent maint again. After trying for a while to fix it then leaving and coming back he decided he couldn't fix it and had to find another one. The first morning after my cousin arrived, she woke to roll over and find a pair of mens underwear that did not belong to anyone in our party! We immediately called the housekeeping to notify of her findings only to have them tell her they must belong to her husband! She then hung up and called the front desk to complain of all the issues building up and also to let them know of the panels that are coming off the wall near the balcony of our wonderful view of the parking lot. They said it being memorial day weekend they could only move us to another room and have no other sister hotels to send us to or rooms to upgrade us to. We had to then pack up all of our belongings and groceries we had bought for a week and move everything to a completely different building. The hotel did not even offer to help! They only thing they could do to make up for it was a dinner off site (we refused to eat at their horrible restaurant). Which when it came time for us to get our vouchers and go to dinner they were not at the front desk. So they had to track down the GM to get them. All the while we missed the shuttle and had to pay for a taxi! We also had her comp us a few drinks at the pool but she was not happy about having to do both. Our room had two bathrooms, so one bathroom was shared by four people. Knowing this, housekeeping still only gave us enough towels for two people. The bedrooms do not have any fans and the air barely worked in our room so my husband and I sweat it out every night. We had the ac on the lowest it would go but still nothing! After sleeping in our new bed my husband and I both noticed we were itchy. We didn't think much of it until after the next night when we were both bright red and covered in hives. We had welts all over our bodies that itched like crazy! I called to the front desk and they said we must just be allergic to their detergant and that it wouldn't help to get new sheets. It did not seem very likely to us that we were both allergic to the same detergant and that we were fine in the first room but not his one! I told her to send the sheets anyways. When we got home we noticed they brought new sheets but rather than put them on they just left them on the table near the door! After we put the new sheets on the day we left we finally started to get better. The shuttle was nice to have but only runs until midnight. So you do not get a ride home if you plan on going home late. All the drivers had different rules and if there were a lot of people waiting you had to wait for the next time which could be an hour. A taxi back to the hotel is a minimum of $20 but will often run you double that with the traffic. We had to use the taxi more often then planned because they had one shuttle broke down so rather than the 15 min wait time they advertise, you wait more like 30. I will say that they nicest people we came across were two of the shuttle drivers. The restaurant at the pool is awful. They are incredibly overpriced. The chicken wings were very over priced and I must say the worst I've ever had. The frozen margaritas out of the machine were great though. But did cost you $12. The pool is large and has water slides but it got extremely crowded on the weekend. There were not enough chairs for people, but plenty of room where they could have bought them. I guess the hotel was too cheap for that. We had six people in our room but were only allowed to check out one pool float per room! They had a cookout for the weekend that we decided to purchse food from. We went to the food only to find you must go to the restaurant on the other side of the pool area to stand in line to purchase tickets then come back to the food to stand in line to get your food! We did this and when it was our turn to get our food they ran out!! They were not sure if they would get anymore, but finally came up with some 30 minutes later. The only reason we were able to get food was because we happened to walk up and check to see if any was there right before it had once again run out. The organization and planning of this hotel is a disgrace. After staying at this hotel I will NEVER purchase a timeshare. I will NEVER EVER recommend this hotel to ANYONE! This is the worst hotel on the market. I am highly disappointed. Especially after reading so many great reviews. I could go on and on about how much this hotel ruined our trip but I will stop. I think you get the point. It was awful and completely ruined our trip. Oh and my husband and I just finally got our hives, redness and severe itching to go away today...one week after being home! DO NOT stay here!!!!!Please read this review as it is 100% honest and is intended to warn future travelers about the Holiday Inn LAX. The purpose of my trip was for 6 adult business partners and clients - all traveling seperately and with no personal relationships to spend a week in Los Angeles to attend and work at a major music event. I made the reservation through Priceline and was guaranteed accommodation for 6 adults, with 3 hotel rooms. Upon arrival in 3 cars, we were stopped at the front gate - which is approx. 1/4 of a mile away from the hotel entrance - by a barrier which required us to push a button to validate each car and would charge us $16 per car, per night for parking. Quickly doing some math at the gate I figured that 3 cars for 7 days at $16 per car was going to cost me an extra $336 + 9.5% tax!! This by itself was a huge shock to me as it was a drastic expense for which I had neither planned, budgeted or been told about. They literally wait until you are at the front gate! Obviously, having just got off a red eye flight, we all just wanted to get to bed. At the desk I spoke to the manager on duty, Rodolfo Guitierez, about the parking. His immediate reaction took all of us by surprise...he stated that we should go and park elsewhere if we're not happy. He then started laughing and joking in Spanish to his staff which made me afraid for my safety as I was in a city I had never visited before. He would even start to address me in Spanish and then convert back to English mid-sentence. Is this the type of point-of-contact customer service that Holiday Inn is training their employees, especially managers? It was very clear that this man was tired, angry and had a very short temper. Any kind of bargaining or simple question was shot down in flames with a very stern "will that be all senor?". I am Sir not Senor. At this point, whilst realizing that I'm going to have to fork out for the parking, I just wanted some sleep. This next part just blows my mind. All 6 of us went to our respective 3 reserved rooms and looked on in horror as we discovered that each room only had 1 bed. This is the first time in my entire traveling life that I have booked a room for 2 people where they only give you 1 bed. I immediately thought that there was a mistake, so I went to the front desk again, to speak to the same manager, again. I told him that there are 6 of us so we need 6 beds. He very aggressively told me that each room now only has 1 bed and for a second bed there is a surcharge of $22 per night. Again, calculating 3 extra beds at $22 per night per bed for 7 days, I was looking at an additional $462 + 9.5% tax. This made the situation very distressing, as I had chosen this run down hotel at a cheaper rate with priceline and now realized that for the same price I could have stayed in a 5 star hotel in Hollywood. I tried to reason with the manager and explain my situation but he was clearly in no mood to talk to guests. He has obviously dealt with this same subject with many, many previous guests as he was almost expecting my questions and was basically ignoring them. He told me to call Priceline and move aside to allow other guests to check in. I called Priceline and had quite possibly the longest, most pointless conversation with a middle eastern girl who would not answer any questions. I asked for a supervisor and was told that there are no supervisors. I hung up. I then called Holiday Inn corporate office and spoke to a man who was very nice and told me he would contact the hotel manager to resolve the problem. I then received a call to my room from the same manager as before, Rodolfo, who yelled at me that if I wanted extra beds, I should just pay for them or just share a bed. Unfortunately, the hotel and Priceline won the battle by just shutting off communication and refusing to remedy the problems. After much screaming, tearing hair out and long phone calls, we were forced to remain at the hotel and share beds, as well as paying hundreds of dollars just to park our cars. I am truly disgusted. My whole company are disgusted and please be assured that none of us will ever stay at a Holiday Inn or use Priceline again. Ever. An awful experience which ruined the entire trip. Is this what travel has come down to? Desperate hotels and booking companies letting morals fly out the window and adding charge after charge for meaningless nonsense such as a parking spot or an additional bed? One thing is clear - you are no longer a guest at a hotel, you are a cash cow, in every sense of the word. All in all I was quite pleased with the cleanliness and location, but from the bottom of my heart and speaking from alot of traveling experience, this was the worst and rudest staff and management my business partners and I have ever, ever encountered. BEWARE.My family and i have recently returned from my daughter's destination wedding along with 50+ guests at this hotel resort. I was one of the few lucky ones that did get the room that i wanted.. beautiful room on the top floor with an ocean view..accomdations? great. guest services? non-existent. When I say "guest services", I will tell you that I am talking about everyone from the hotel operators, front desk clerks, managers, housekeeping, outside bartenders, one of the sales people, reservations, etc. the wedding planner and wedding planners assistant i will have to write on another review because they were not part of hilton staff but were completely utterly useless. Lets see, where do i begin, so much to say. this will not be in order but here goes: at check in, which is 4:00..late to begin with, a lot of guests' rooms were not ready. many of our guests were arriving on friday (wedding was saturday). some guests did not get into their rooms until 6:00pm. the groom, who instead of relaxing the day before his wedding, had to be in the lobby with the person who was in charge of the room bookings, directing her as each guest came. it turns out that a lot of the guest werent given the room they wanted/needed (king bed versus double beds or vice versa) so the groom spent a considerable amount of time directing and helping to coordinate the guest rooms with the sales manager (what a joke title). my sister in laws ceiling had a leak. one guest sat at the edge of her bed and the upper end went flying.., housekeeping NEVER came to clean our room.. i checked in Friday, saturday it was never cleaned. the morning of the wedding, my daughter was in the honeymoon suite and the ac was not working. temp was 90 outside with humidity high. it took over an hour for someone to come to the room and attempt to fix it. we called again after another hour goes by and room still hadnt cooled. they came back up rather annoyed and told us that because we were using a blow dryer (ONE BLOW DRYER) that must be the reason the air wasnt cooling. (WE WERE IN A 2 STORY SUITE, HOW CAN ONE BLOW DRYER HEAT UP A ROOM AND OUTDO AN AC) My daughter was trying to get ready for her wedding day for christ sake! another request to guest services went unanswered (2 calls within one hour) phone rang off the hook before someone finally answered. i simply asked for 10 champagne glasses to be brought up (the photographer wanted to take pic of bridal party pretending to drink champagne before heading off) the glasses NEVER came). housekeeping did not come to clean room later. they did not come AT ALL. the maid of honor (my 15 yr old and grooms sister snuck away during cocktail hour) to clean the honeymoon suite for them) after all, there were about 10 of us in there that sat morning getting ready. the atm machines in the hotel were not working. at check out time, my bill was totally wrong. we were supposed to get a discount for saturday nite because of the group rate for wedding at $165 per night. the bill said $185. i "calmly" argued with the front desk clerk (who never once looked me in the eye but instead kept his eyes on the computer screen the entire time i was talking to him - Joel was his name) he said, well, do you have the confirmation for that???? hellllllooooooooo we have a CONTRACT. no i dont have it, but the bride does...for gods sake. i told him, well, every single guest's bill is going to be wrong. so out comes Victor who also insisted that was the correct charge. (IT WASNT) but rather than "calmly" continuing to argue i just paid the bill at $185 for both nights. later, i was correct, yes, it was supposed to be $165 as my daughter told me.. its in her CONTRACT. do you think i will see my money? no....why, because i paid cash and they probably just pocketed the extra. when i mentioned that housekeeping never came there was no comment.. nothing, no apology or explanation.. just more looking at the screen.. he was probably playing a video game for all i know. also, i fyou want to sleep late, forget it, they want to kick you out of there as early as possible.. but check you in as late as possible.. and trust me, you will not get a discount if you get checked in late through no fault of your own. forget breakfast. at the hotel..everything is way overpriced,. go out the lobby, take a left and walk right across the way to Subway where you can get breakfast for $4.00 including coffee. you can take the bus to Old San Juan from the bus stop near the Normandie Hotel for .75 cents per person. the taxi in front of the hilton cost you $3.00 per person plus whatever else fee they want to charge.. the reality is, a taxi, even if there are like 5 or 6 of you travelling to Old San Juan, should cost $10 flat. Jose Gonzalez who runs a private taxi and is wonderful will take you his number is 787-909-2236. he picked us up in front of the hilton and he got royally yelled at by the staff. make sure he picks you up across the street! I can honestly say that guest services in this hotel do not exist at all, although i cant speak for the concierge as i did not use their service. as far as the actual SITE.. as in the reception area..was beautiful.. outside by the area to the left of the pool was spectacular and the food was delicious. the photographers and videogrpaher and musicians hired by my daughter and son in law were phenomenal (not referred by the Hilton) but researched on their own. as far as the scenic beauty and the privacy of the beach by the Caribe Hilton, it is truly amazing as is the tropical garden, however, if that is ALL you are looking for and you want to fend for yourself in every other way, then by all means stay, but if you want to get your moneys worth in terms of oh, say, having someone answer the guest service phone when you dial their number.. or... i dont know.. say, you ac in your room is not working and you're getting ready for an important day and your makeup is starting to smear down your face cuz its so hot, and you might want someone to fix it, yes, well, then i say, stay at the Marriott or any of the other just as highly priced but much better service at the Condado strip just a little ways down, the Hilton area is appealing..but what are you willing to give up to stay here? (ps; did i mention my sister in laws room ceiling leaked)Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings.

This hotel was not our first choice to stay during our recent pre-Christmas trip to New York - it wasn't even our tenth choice, due to the poor Tripadvisor ranking this place has received. I'd spent a long time trawling the net for a reasonably priced place to stay in a central location, but every hotel I was interested in was either fully booked, or extortionately priced. So, in the end, with misgivings, I booked the Edison, which still had vacancies in spite of its indisputably brilliant location. We had also noticed that every bad Tripadvisor review was followed by a flurry of excellent ones, posted by "new reviewers", who hadn't posted before, or since. If nothing else, the Edison has a well-developed "damage limitation department". I wish they devoted their energy to improving the hotel instead. Now, before you think I'm being a drama queen, please take a look at the pictures I took in the bathroom of room 1645. Eeeeeuwwww! If you like your reviews short, stop reading now, and just DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF! If you like your reviews detailed, here goes: We booked a double room for three nights, at a cost of $1,085.71 incl. of taxes. We flew in from Munich on a flight that took longer than usual, due to high winds over the Atlantic, and were pretty tired. It took over an hour to get through immigration. We took a cab from JFK to the Edison, where a fed up looking doorman dumped our cases on the busy pavement, and told us to wait. We decided to wheel our own instead, and made our way to reception. The first impression that greeted us was a strong smell of rancid frying fat. We identified the likely source of the reek as the Cafe Edison, which has an entrance just off the lobby as you walk in the door. We made our way to the reception desk, where two receptionists were busy in a private conversation, and ignored us completely for what seemed an age. Finally, in possession of our key cards, we headed for the lift. The public areas were festive and pleasant enough, if somewhat tired, with scuffed furnishings, and large rolls of new carpet being stored on the way to the entrance of the Italian Restaurant towards the back of the building. This was Friday - when we left on Monday the rolls of carpet were still there. Is there really no storage at all away from public view? It's not just about esthetics - why narrow the way to the back door, a potential escape in case of fire? Once we stepped out of the lift on our floor, our hearts sank. Scruffy corridor, patched up paint work, battered radiator covers, hideous institutional pinky-beige paint work, bad lighting, and the room was so vile we headed straight back down to reception. A young woman issued us with a new room key, and even managed to crack a smile when tipped. The second room was the same size and location, but on a higher floor, and the carpet was marginally less revolting. Had we been less exhausted, we'd have gone back down, hopefully "third time lucky", but frankly, we just wanted to get some sleep. Thus committed, we felt a bit, well, screwed, for the rest of our stay. We should have looked for somewhere else, but that's not how you want to spend precious holiday time, and we already knew the town was pretty booked. The room contained a standard double bed, with polyester sheets, lumpy foam pillows, and a very pronounced dip in the center of the mattress, that suggested a) this is usually allocated as a single room, b) the mattress is cheap and old. Gross! How many generations of tourists have sweated into this thing? Space was so limited that only one side of the bed had a bedside table. The rest of the furniture was old and scuffed - the sort of stuff that people abandon on the pavement when they move house. On the plus side, it was a dual aspect room with a window on each side, one overlooking the distant Hudson, which was nice. Also, the heater was powerful, and we were toasty in spite of the seasonal drop in temperature. The bathroom doesn't have a proper extractor, but a sort of "ventilation hole" with an ill-fitting grille. There was a shower curtain instead of a screen, which must lead to endless flooding and water penetration problems. I have documented the mould and mildew problem in the attached photographs. We had one breakfast in the Cafe Edison, pancakes and bacon, and French toast with bacon. The bacon was pre-cooked, cold and hard, the OJ cheap and synthetic tasting. Cheap white bread, one tiny plastic portion of milk per coffee - thankfully there's a Starbucks down on the next corner. We had one dinner in the Italian Restaurant downstairs. Split-level layout - we were seated at a tiny downstairs table by a totally fed-up greeter, in spite of the place being almost empty. This left us nose-level with the stinky carpet of the upper level. Two waiters kept whining within earshot about the shortcomings of the guy who brings the bread and water. The coat check lady was charming and smiley, other than that our impression was of serious staff dissatisfaction throughout the hotel. If the guest rooms are that depressing, what must the areas be like that are out of public view? I'd hate to work there, seriously. Apart from the hotel, we had a really super time in this gorgeous, exciting city, and enjoyed the sightseeing, wonderful helicopter flight with liberty helicopters, a fun Southern soul food dinner with yummy draught beer at "Delta", with super friendly staff and good music, which is in walking distance on 9th, good steak and wine at Capital Grille (also easily walkable), fantastic Christmas decorations everywhere, super views from the Rockefeller Center, amazing architecture, and the not-to-be-missed Grand Central Station. The Woolworth Building, omg, so stunning! The only other disappointment was the tatty sprawl that is Macy's. Please don't stay here, and ignore the "1 review" brigade that posts rave reviews. The only plus in this place is the location, if you need to be close to Times Square.We were booked into the London Apollo Hotel at Bayswater, which is ideally situated between Queensway & Bayswater stations, and a stones throw from Kensington Gardens â€“ location wise you couldnâ€™t ask for more. At the time of booking the hotel, I believed it was a three star & hence in our price range, unbeknown to ourselves, it is now rated on their website as a two star hotel, but when you in walk in thru their front doors all the stars have been taped over. We would have arrived at the hotel at around 6:30pm on the evening of the 1st June, 2008, which I thought was great as I would have time to check in, dump the luggage & get to White Chappell for a Jack the Ripper tour â€“ no such luck. On going to the first room, we discovered that rubbish had been left on a bed in the room, what looked like a huge mould patch in the top right hand corner of the room, and the phone didnâ€™t work. We had text a girlfriend of mine to say that we had arrived at the hotel & the hotel room we would be in, we text her while we were in reception before we went up to the room â€“ she phoned the hotel from a land line from where she was staying in London & there was no answer in our room, the chap on reception told her we must have gone out, we had just arrived, & just the way the chap spoke to my girlfriend, she did ask me if he was on this planet, he was un co-operative & not willing to do anything. Hence she text us wanting to know where we were as she had tried to phone, that is when we discovered the phone didnâ€™t work as we where in the room when she text us, so we phoned her on her mobile, I didnâ€™t have her land line number, from our mobile, we went thru international roaming to get to her on her mobile thru international roaming, Iâ€™m still waiting to see what the phone bill is going to be, all because the chap at reception was to lazy to get off his bum. I went downstairs to - one â€“ complain about the rubbish in the room & - two â€“ the phone not working. He apologized in a non-apologetic way & gave us a key to another room. I went back up to the fourth floor to gather up one husband & the luggage to move down to the second floor â€“ it was during the time of trying to go down in the lift the first time I realized the lift didnâ€™t work on the forth floor for the down button, you had to press the up button & hope for the best. Anyway down to the second floor & into the next room. It was smaller but looked cleaner, but was a little chilly, so we decided to close the window only to find the window was broken in the hinge hence we were unable to close the window. So I went downstairs & asked the chap if he could come up & close the window for us, to which he replied that he couldnâ€™t, he then gave me a key for another room. I went back up to get my husband, but left our luggage in the second room, we went off to the third room, which was at the base of some very narrow stairs, we walked into a very small room with a very large double bed, it was really a single room, you couldnâ€™t move in it let alone get the luggage in. The sheets looked gray & the room was dusty & a little musty. So I went back up to reception & told the chap that there was no way I was staying in that room & I wanted to talk to the manager/owner, of which he replied that he was, so I told him that I couldnâ€™t swing a cat in it, let alone get our luggage in there â€“ he wanted to know what I meant, so I told him that room was too small & it was not what I had paid for, he told me that there where no more rooms available, so I asked him to find me another hotel, miraculously another key for another room was presented, to which we went off to inspect. Room number four was on the ground floor, it had two double beds & two single beds & I could close the window. The lino on the floor looked new, where as the other rooms had carpet which was a bit worse for wear, but the lino looked like it had been a DIY lay, very rough. We werenâ€™t game enough to drink out of the cups & glasses provided. The chest of drawers had knobs broken off, but the phone did work. The wardrobe had part of the back missing & it looked like whoever swept in there swept the rubbish from the floor under the chest of drawers, I donâ€™t think anyone had swept from under the beds since the lino was laid. The bed boards above the beds had graffiti carved into them. All I could think of was that it was for only two nights. We had trouble trying to find the light switch for the light & fan for the bathroom, the chap from reception finally got off him bum to show us where the switch was, it was floor level behind a chair. The show curtain in the bathroom hadnâ€™t be hung correctly, so we showered with the curtain open for the first bathing session of which there was some water on the floor â€“ we had four large towels in the room, but no foot mat for the bathroom, hence we used a towel each, one as a foot mat & one to mop up, we were replaced with two very small towels, more the size of hand towels, the towel didnâ€™t go around me length wise & Iâ€™m a size 10 to 12, so I wonâ€™t say that I was a large person. Hence to say after getting our room sorted, it was too late to do the Jack the Ripper tour, & the tour that I wanted to do is only on a Sunday & Wednesday evenings, we arrived on the Sunday & flew home on the Tuesday evening, hence no Jack the Ripper tour - there were two things I really wanted to do in London â€“ a Jack the Ripper tour & Baker Street â€“ Baker Street I did, but no Ripper tour, so that has left a very sour taste & put on a damper on the only time we have ever been to London. This hotel is in a wonderful position, but it needs a lot of repairs & maintenance & the attitude problem of the chap we struck on reception needs to be addressed, there was a night receptionist chap who was quite pleasant, & another lass who was accommodating, but the first chap we struck, who also told me he was the manager/owner has absolutely no idea of what is expected by his guests, even Basil Fawlty could run rings around him. We stayed in a hostel in Edinburgh, it was wonderful & again it left the Apollo at Bayswater for dead. We wouldn't want anyone else to go through what we went through, time is precious especially when it is limited like ours was & to be mucked around like we were & to have your time wasted unnecessarily due to poor management is just not acceptable, and you wouldnâ€™t wish it upon anyone.

This was the most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed. I read over the internet that hotels classification is overly generous in Mexico but to call this a 5star hotel is a fraud. First I didn’t chose to stay here I bought a last minute. The reviews I read on the internet about this place were 1/3 good and I decided to ignore the other 2/3 of the reviews which were describing couple of issues. Big mistake! First thing when you come here don’t expect the welcoming cocktail and other fancy stuff from the brochure. You are lucky if someone helps you with your luggage. It was 12:30 when I arrived and at the reception desk I was told I can only check-in at 3 o’clock (!!). After travelling 12 hours to get there I was suppose to just wait another 2.5 hours in the lobby because they just couldn’t give me a room earlier that 3 o’clock. I tried to use this time booking for restaurants. Make no mistakes, this was an all inclusive package, but you can not just show up to eat, you need a booking. Even if my stay was of 7 nights I could only book 4 restaurants. I was wondering what was I suppose to eat the rest of the days, bear with me that’s soon to come. Apparently they have 5 restaurants but not all of them open and not all of them available (the most common answer was “already all booked, sir”). The most readily available were the Mexican and Mediterranean, and I was able to try the Oriental as well. The Oriental was the worst oriental food I ever ate. The miso soup was done only with tofu (!) and it had that awful Mexican spice (oregano?) and it was uneatable. The service was so slow and despite the fact I had a half of glass of sake in my front they were keep coming to ask refill it with wine. At some point I gave up and let them do whatever. The sushi rolls were mediocre and the sashimi was gross (some chunks of fish and red meat partially cocked on the exterior with an over all taste of altered food and palatal feeling of eating some kind of a squishy mash). In all of the restaurants there was this atmosphere of outdated and overused decorations and utilities (the printed menus were so used at the corners, some of the glasses and plates were chipped, a lot dust on the decorative plastic plants). I wouldn’t give these restaurants 5stars not even if I count 1 star for each. Once you finish all your allotted bookings you are expected to eat in the buffet. Here the atmosphere was truly disgusting. It really felt I was eating at my work place cafeteria. The food was in good quantity but lacked in quality. Generous deserts but nothing edible. Fruits? Just bananas, melons, sometimes grapes, grapefruits. Drinks? All you can drink but drink what? Sangria, only one type of red and white wine and plenty of cocktails that were badly done. You can forget about coffee, it tastes like pee no matter what you put in it and if you are on a diet this is not the plase (no sweeteners like splenda, aspartame or anything else but sugar). All beverages were sweet or very sweet and taste like children medicine. I could not get used with them till the end. The famous room was ready not at 3pm but 4pm. When I entered the room I had a shock! It smelled so bad like it was never clean and it was infested with moulds. I returned to the reception desk to ask for a room change. The second one offered had the same smell but moulds only in the bathroom so I got it that they have mould infestation everywhere. No carpets in the room, just tiles, and very rudimentary furnished (a small table, a TV, an alarm clock on the side table) nothing from the somptuosity of a 5 star hotel room, no lustre, nothing. One day I woke up and found the toilet regurged. Disgusting! I called house keeping and they clean and said they fixed it. When I used the toilet again it didn’t flush. For the last 3 days of my stay I couldn’t use my own bathroom otherwise I would have had to stay with my own [--] in the house, can you imagine that? They always said they fixed and that is not a reason to change the room. Toiletries were bad quality Mexican Wal-Mart type. The towels were old and used and some of them had stains. The only good part was that there were no mosquitoes in my room, just some mouths flies (that the mate could not just remove it), a lizard, and some spiders (tells something about how clean the place is, doesn’t it?). Anyway no insect to bite me or eat my blood and that was one of the only good things. The premise is at least kept clean but there is nothing to do inside. They have some desperate animals (some dears, some flamingo, apparently some monkeys I haven’t seen, and couple of parrots). There are couple of pools one being the animation area. That is the worse part of the resort, always noisy, the animator only spoke Spanish and all was played was Mexican music). The beach is non existent! Look at the pictures of the hotel on the internet. You get what you see, a 10 meters long beach were you can’t do anything. If you want sun and palm trees you should be ok, but if you expect to swim in the ocean in a so-called beach resort you are doom to be disappointed…again. The service is slow and nobody speaks English, French or mostly any other language than Spanish. At the check out they charged my visa without my authorisation! They charged me for something I didn’t order and there was no way out but to pay them. They threatened me with the police!MY date and I both ordered the Branzini and both felt the fish was very average.Would not recommend anyone to go.The Worst Vacation I Ever Had The only positive thing I can say about this facility is that the grounds are well maintained...and now for the bad news: 1.Arrival and check-in took 45 minutes. No one seemed to know how to use the computer or who was responsible for what.2.Room upgrades that we booked were ignored and the # of beds requested were incorrect3. We finally got to room and it took another hour for the bags to arrive.4.Dinner Reservations were totally frustrating. We were told we had no reservation (even though we called prior and were told we didn鈥檛 need to do that until we arrived) and were sent to the Marketplace for dinner. The food in this factory style buffet was the qualityof a public school cafeteria. You couldn't eat healthy if you wanted to. 5.Were told by , a guest relation worker, to confirm flight the following day at 10:30. This was a scam to run us into the vacation club presentation.6. We woke up on our first full day to no running water. We called and were told it would be fixed. We called again after 40 minutes when no one arrived.7.We went to see another rep at 10:30 to confirm our flight. He was not there and we waited 30 minutes for him to show up and then ask us to wait another 15 minutes. When he finally sat down, he told us he couldn鈥檛 confirm out flight until the day before our departure and proceeded to try to sell us on excursions. We were very clear that we were not interested in buying anything further and the sales pitch continued. When asked if we had any questions we expressed that our lack of water was still and issue and he advised up to call the 3000 number which we told him we called twice already. He made no other effort to assist us and we were then ushered out by guest relation workerand put on a golf cart.8.We were then taken to a Vacation Club meeting and were told by guest relation workerthat we need to sit for 20 minutes even though the paper said 90 so he could get his points and we would get 50.00 to spend. We told him we weren鈥檛 interested in the club but at that point thought we could get someone鈥檚 attention about the water if we went in. The guest relation worker said that if we sat with the rep. he would call a manager about the water. So we did sit there and then told the female rep about the problem. Without hesitation she went on with the sales pitch. Another male rep was sent over and we told him we were not interested in buying a club membership. He apologized about our bad experiences thus far and inquired how much we paid for our vacation. He then proceeded to walk us over to a gallery of pictures. ( the founder and all the other Melia resorts around the world) He the asked, 鈥淗ow would like to spend less on our vacation next time?鈥?To which I responded, 鈥淲ill my room have water?鈥?I then told him outright how aggravated I was that the beginning of my first vacation day was taken up by these sales antics. He then summoned two managers who we told how disappointed we were in our first day鈥檚 stay. We alerted them about the water and then and only then after going through the 3000 number twice,guest relation worker , the rep from hotel beds, the female rep, the male rep did they offer to call to see to the problem. We were in the midst of other vacationers receiving the sales pitch and I believe their interest was in shutting us up as to not allow the others to see our dissatisfaction. 9.We left and walked back to our room (no one offered to escort us and they had TO the sales promotion) and miraculously the problem had been rectified. By this time it was almost 2pm.10.Specialty restaurants the food was terrible. The menus did not make sense. Why in an Italian restraint would you not have Parmesan cheese on the tables? Since when is Brie cheese an Italian appetizer? The seafood that was offered seemed frozen. The desserts were definitely frozen and thawed, sometimes not even all the way. In the French restaurant I ordered a spinach role and was served a soggy plate of green slop swimming in cream. Presentation and especially taste were appalling. 11.The bars were under-stocked and under manned. At the pool bar the soda fountains on the upper level did not work. Every time you ordered a soda they would have to go down to the bottom pool level to retrieve it. 鈥hey did not stock basic things like cranberry or orange juices.鈥hey only offered Presidente beer. 鈥artenders would ignore you unless you put tip money on the bar BEFORE service.鈥?Bartenders did not know how to make basic drinks. I received a Cosmopolitan at the bar by the Mexican restaurant in a glass with salt around the rim as if I had ordered a Margherita. I thought it was a mistake so I reordered the drink to get another the same way.12.The only way to get service was to show the tips and no one would make change. I was told by the front desk, guest services, the store and the bartenders they could not make change for a 20 dollar bill. 13.The only way to get change was at the casino and for that you had to get chips. In order to get ANY SERVICE you had to put a tip out which should not be the case. Any decent percent would tip for good service rendered. THIS resort seemed to work in reverse. 14.No one answered a question directly and we were sent to person after person.15.To make a dinner reservation was extremely frustrating. In order to get one you had to call no later than 11 am and the staff would rush you off the phone mid question. I was hung up on twice in mid sentence.16. My husband and I were celebrating our 13 wedding anniversary adn were profoundly disappointed in this trip. It was frustrating and I had a stress headache for the 9 days we were there. MY advice is go to the BAHAMAS where people are glad to see you, friendly, hand you a drink upon arrival and tell you to RELAX because you're on vacation.On April 24th, I made an online reservation for Thousand Hills. They had a special if you booked a condo for 7 days you received a 35% discount off the room rate. I reserved a 1 bedroom condo and the reservation went through no problem. I was happy with the room and the rate. Later that afternoon, I received a phone call from Thousand Hills stating that they did not have any 1 BR condo available for the entire week I would be in Branson. At the time the TH representative said he would upgrade me to a 2 bedroom at the same price. Later that day I received an e-mail confirmation with the price I was quoted plus the room type as 2 BR Condo. I was very happy that I would have more room, I allowed my son to invite a friend along for the trip. All was set. 4 days before heading to TH, I called to make sure that my request for being close to a pool was noted on my reservation. At that time ( 4 days before my arrival and 3 months after my reservation ) I was informed that I was back to a 1 BR condo at the original price. I at no time was notified by Thousand Hills of the down grade. I had added more people to the reservation so a 1 BR would no longer work for us. I asked to speak with a manager. I was given to a mgr ( I believe her name was CiCi ) and explained the situation. She claimed that policy was if my original reservation opened up, they downgrade anyone that had been upgraded and since they now had a large group coming in, They needed the larger condo for them. I was not happy, since I had NO communication with TH between April and July other than them trying to sell me show tickets. No where in the fine print of the reservation confirmation does it say anything about possible downgrade after and upgrade. It speaks of cancellation only. Many times while on the phone with CiCi, I was rudely reminded that I had what I originally reserved, and I explained to her that once I received my upgrade information, we invited more kids along. I was not happy with her tone, so I asked to speak with her manager. I was then given to Ginger. I Explained once again what had happened. She told me that I should have been told about the downgrade if they need the units. But since I was not, give her a few moments to see what she could find. One of the groups only needed a 1 bedroom now, she had just received their final list so I was lucky and she could give me the 2 BR. I was very happy at that point and was looking forward to checking in on Monday. I have stayed at TH before on 2 occasions with groups so I know how nice the condos can be. When I checked in I had asked to be in a certain area that is close to a pool, basketball courts and other kid activities, there is also grass that the kids could run around and throw a ball. The condo I was given, was nothing like that. It was way around in the wooded area with no grass area, very small pool (because of the heat had algae in it) and I believe the oldest buildings that TH has. When we arrived at the room there was caution tape up on cones for some cement work that was going on. When we walked into the condo, the first odor that came and hit us in the face was Smoke. I am not a smoker and have allergies as well as my kids. I knew this would not work so I picked up the phone and called the lobby. The first person I speak to is CiCi ( again with a rude tone ) telling me there is nothing else. It was only 2pm in the afternoon, you can not tell me that everyone had checked in. I asked for her supervisor and was given to Ginger again. She also told me they had nothing because they had to keep groups together and if they moved me then someone else would be unhappy! They could bring an ionizer machine over to help with the smell. Nothing I said was going to change my location. I tried to find a new hotel in the area, but since there was a softball tournament in town plus dance groups too, I was not able to locate anything within the price range I had to keep. I let them bring the machine and it sounded like a large, loud tornado fan. So we sat the first night with the machine on and tv blasting. It did not help with the smoke smell at all. I asked the next day to move but of course was told no. I went to the outlets and purchased some air fresheners to help with the smell. It did not get rid of it but it covered it a little bit. I had to double up on the allergy medicine to not be all stuffy. The "golf" view from our condo was completely covered in overgrown trees. The furniture and decor is very outdated compared to other units I have stayed in. The bed in the master bedroom was not attached to the head board correctly so when I rolled over or moved it made loud noises. The toilet seat was broken, The second toilet ran water all the time. Because I was staying for a week, I was to have a mid week cleaning and sheet change. That never happened. When I checked out, I mentioned the cleaning to them and they told me I should have called. I had ruined the 1st night of my trip being frustrated with the unit, I was not going to make any more phone calls and ruin the rest of my trip. We decided to leave a day early since at that point all of our allergies were terrible from the smoke smell. When I checked out, I was informed that since I was leaving a day early that I would no longer have the 35% discount it would be down to 30%. Just one more little thing to rub in my face. I should have given them the $20 receipt for the air fresheners, but at that point I already knew I would never stay there again or recommend them to friends. It was all about the money and I was only 1 guest, not a large group. To top it off, on Thursday of our week stay, we had what I would have thought were elephants move in above us. They were loud from 7 am to midnight every day. On 2 mornings at 8 am, I received phone calls that would wake us up wanting to speak to the owner! By the 2nd day I got smart and unplugged the phones. There are plenty of hotels in Branson so I suggest you look around for some better deals. I would have paid a little bit more to not have a stressful week, but it was too late once we got there.The $72 Delmonico steak had to be sent back because it was not cooked to order.During Spring Break, my mother and I were taking a trip down the coast of Florida in order to visit a college I had been accepted into, Stetson University. We had booked a Holiday Inn Express near the university (which is a bit inland) for the weekend in case we could not find a suitable hotel along the coast. We decided midway through our drive that we wanted to spend a night on a beachside hotel, so we called the Hilton 1-800 number and booked two nights in this hotel. We agreed that although we had not seen the hotel, we knew we could depend upon the Hilton name and quality. We could not have been more wrong. When we arrived at the hotel, the entrance to the hotel was crammed with cars and people. It took about 3 minutes to be noticed by the valet because there were so many people trying to leave the tightly packed driveway. When we were able to speak to someone from the valet, they informed us that we were at the wrong tower to check in and that we had to travel further down the road to the other tower. An understandable request, although the entrance was hardly noticeable when traveling down the busy road that was filled with cars and pedestrians that would jaywalk whenever they pleased. After finally getting to the correct tower, we went to the check-in counter and were given our keys and told that we had to go back to the other tower. When we asked about parking, we were told that we could either park across the highway or we could use their valet for a fee. We decided that valet was the safer choice, even though the valet driveways were a confusing disaster. When we reached our room, my mother and I were disgusted, to say the least. The room looked dirty and very worn. The bathroom looked dirty, the windows were covered with fingerprints, and our blankets had gum all over them. When you opened the door to the "balcony" (which is really just a concrete step with railing), there were cigarette ashes covering the rails. The room looked as though it had not been truly cleaned in a decade. My mother and I decided that we were not going to feel clean sleeping in the rooms, so we called the lobby and complained that the room was just not up to par with Hilton's standards. The lady who answered asked us if our view was bad, and we replied that the view was fine (Oceanfront, 11th floor). She told us that she would move us to another room on 7th floor. When we asked her if the room was better than the one we were in, she replied that the hallways were better. She said she would send someone up to trade keys for our new room. When the lady arrived with our new keys she said with a laugh "Here are your keys for your new room. I guess the room's view is more...southerly." We were not sure what she meant, but the sarcasm in her voice was very noticeable and we gave her a nervous laugh and traded our keys. When we got to the new room, it was almost exactly the same. The only difference was that there were no ashes on the balcony, no gum on the bed, and hairs littered throughout the bathroom. The hairs (which were definitely not from anyone's head) were stuck on the toilet and in the soap holder, and my mother and I decided that we would not be taking our shoes off when walking in the hotel. In the middle of our inspection of the new room, a maid, without knocking, entered the room and quickly apologized that she didn't think anyone was in there. We explained that we had just been switched here, so it was no problem. She asked if there was anything that we needed and we explained that we didn't have a room service menu. She said that she would be back with one right away. While my mother and I waited, we decided we would stay in the hotel for the night, but cancel the next day's stay there. We called the front desk and cancelled, and also requested that someone bring up a room service menu. The person who answered did not seem to believe that we had not been supplied a menu and kept asking if we were SURE there was not one there. We had searched the entire room by this point, and had discovered previous guests' trash in the drawers, but had found no menu. The lady said she would ask the Room Service Department to send someone up right away. After 40 minutes from when we had asked the maid to bring a menu, and about 30 minutes from when we had called the front desk, we decided to directly call Room Service for a menu. Perhaps the best service of the entire hotel, we got the menu in 10 minutes. We decided that we would not risk the room service, as it was obvious that the hotel was not exactly clean and the choices were not what we had wanted. We decided that we would try the hotel's restaurant, Hyde Park. This was the worst dining experience I have ever had. Usually I am a very good tipper and I do not require very much attention when I dine out. But NEVER I have been completely ignored before. Our waiter would only talk to my mother. He would never look at me, nor did he ever talk to me unless I asked him something directly. For example, when my mother ordered a glass of wine, I had to stop him from leaving in order to order my drink. Not only was the service terrible, but also my food was not edible. One of my favorite things to eat is seafood, so I ordered a dish that had scallops and shrimp served in a lemon sauce. When I received my food, the scallops were so overcooked that they were rubbery and inedible. The shrimp were also overcooked, but the sauce saved them and I ate them. The mashed potatoes that I ordered as a side were delicious and the only thing that I would recommend to anyone. All in all, my experiences at the Hilton at Daytona Beach and the Hyde Park restaurant were HORRIBLE. I would recommend the Hilton to Spring Breakers had the prices not been so insanely high. This hotel is dirty and the service is horrible.The slogan of this hotel is maximum vegas - I beg to differ. While this resort has excellent an location on the strip and some very nice hotel amenities (the pool) the rooms and staff are in need of upgrading - desperately. We selected the MGM this time for my 30th birthday and have been to Vegas 7 times previously, this was the 4th time to this resort and it is safe to say we will not be back. I realize that the MGM empire is large in Vegas; however, I would suggest that the mindset of this conglomerate switches from quantity to quality. ROOMS We were extremely disappointed with the room. The first issue that we had with the room was the lack of a fridge. That is totally ridiculous. What resort, especially one claiming to be 'maximum vegas' does not come with a fridge? Nothing like warm bottle of water or beer after walking the strip! I was equally unimpressed to find that the TV's in the room was an 18" Phillips tube televisions. The last time I saw a TV like that was in my Grandma's den, 10 years go! Today, you would be hard pressed to find that TV anywhere other than good will (and the MGM of course). The carpet in the room was absolutely disgusting, filled with I would say 20 years of Vegas funk. I thought the carpets were gross 8 years ago; but, they have yet to be changed (or cleaned for that matter). The HVAC system in our room was so loud it shook the metal casing off of wall in the middle of the night. Scared the crap out of us. It took three calls to MGM's "customer service" and over 12 hours before they were able to organize anyone to attend the room to fix it. The "customer service" at front desk would sooner transfer you to engineering rather than actually assist you with the problem - customer service must simply be a symbolic term for the team at MGM. The various service personnel along with multiple other staff members echoed my sentiments and further indicated that it is becoming embarrassing to work in this hotel as the mandate is to band-aid rather than fix and upgrade (no joke - multiple staff members said this). We also has the delight of black mold in the ceiling of the room. I do not understand how this could have gone unnoticed for that length of time - I would suggest it was notice and not fixed. The picture of the mold is attached for your viewing pleasure. I do have experience with mold in my own employment as a property manager and would hazard to guess that if the surface mold is that prevalent in what should be a dry location in the room, the inner cavity of the walls would be absolutely covered. The hotel staff were notified 3 separate times and they finally wished to urgently relocate us at 7 PM on our last night, 15 minutes prior to our dinner reservations - Brutal service, but typical of our experience with this resort on this trip!! I suggested the the mold may be building up due to the broken bathroom fan. We travelled with others on this trip who had the exact same experience with their rooms - right down to the noisy HVAC, antique appliances and broken bathroom fan. At least the MGM is consistent! We obviously did not spend much time in our room, you rarely do anywhere in Vegas; but, that does not mean that every component within the rooms and the rooms themselves need to be old, dangerous, and under maintained while you enjoy your "Maximum Vegas" experience. The best part - If we were to stay an extra night they were charging $347.00 per night for that room. SLEEP Very little sleep occurred. The amount of noise from other rooms, our HVAC, the hallway and outside was staggering. The sound proofing the MGM is nonexistent. SERVICE Most of my comments pertaining to service are apparent above; however, we had additional instances of horrible service that were not related to the room. The servers and bartenders at Zuri are the rudest group of wait staff that I have encountered - anywhere in the world. It was an unfortunate meeting place for our group due to the proximity to the elevators so we meet there once or twice a day and would usually sit to have one drink together before heading out. We thought it may have been a 1 off but it was again consistent. Rude, arrogant and belittling staff fill that bar - it was nausiating to deal with them. We also had the extreme displeasure of dealing with the most unpleasant host at the David Copperfield Show. This particular gentleman had managed to offend the entire row (almost 20 people) to the point where it took most of us 15 minutes of show time to recover from. He was unbelievable rude and further had no clue how the seats related to the tickets and then proceeded to blame the patrons. I would say that this job is simple. Smile and welcome people, set the mood and guide them to their seats - he failed miserably on all accounts. The show however was great and I do recommend it. POOL The pool was absolutely great. incredible facility, and in my opinion the best I have seen in Vegas. One funny instance though. We spent a portion of two days around the pool. The first day we were drinking beer and we were not carded once although we obviously had id with us. The next day we walked (a great distance) to the bar to order a bottle of water and were made to return to grab ID. The bartender was very aggressive (seems to be a trend at MGM) and indicated its the law; but, that begs the question as to why the resort staff at the MGM are allowed enforce the "law" at their discretion. I thought it was strange, no id needed for alcohol; but, greatly inconvenienced for a bottle of water. Based on the upkeep of their rooms I would guess the pool will eventually have the same fate. OVERALL We will not go back to any MGM property in the near future as their policy on experience has been made abundantly clear to us. The MGM needs to focus on the total package not getting people through the door for special events. They say Vegas is struggling in these hard economic times - I think I might know why! Good Luck in Vegas, it is still lots of fun!This particular location certainly uses substandard meats.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Room - We booked through Westin's 1-800 number, specifying that we wanted an ocean view room and in particular one from which we could stand inside of and see the water. We had read one review noting that their room was sold as having an ocean view, but in fact can only see the water from the balcony. When we checked in, the rooms we were given faced an interior courtyard. When we noted the discrepancy, the receptionist said - with a straight face - that these were in fact ocean view rooms because one end of the courtyard was open towards the water. We were skeptical, but willing to give Westin the benefit of the doubt and at least see the room. Unfortunately (for us), we found that a tree blocked the end of the courtyard towards the ocean. No view of the ocean was possible from the room nor from the balcony - even when (literally) leaning over the side, standing on our tip toes on the balcony, etc. The receptionist and (later) two managers confirmed to us that this was not a mistake. Our assigned room, and many other rooms with no ocean views, are classified as ocean view rooms and sold as such. The rooms that actually have ocean views are called "ocean front" rooms and are solely reserved for time share owners. The receptionist tried to "help" us by sending us to another ocean view room (which did at least have a distant view of the ocean). However, while examining that room, another family arrived who was surprised to find us in the room that they had specifically reserved a few months in an advance.. The receptionist then sent us to another ocean view room from which one can only see trees and car parks, and again, not a sliver of the ocean to be seen. After that, we were told by a manager that we were welcome to move to another hotel if we wanted to see the ocean from our room, since the Westin Vila Resort had no rooms for non-owner guests from which the ocean could be seen. We called a few hotels (Sheraton, Hyatt, Ritz, Four Seasons) but all were fully booked if we wanted two adjoining rooms with ocean view. We then understood why the manager could not care less about us - we didn't have a lot of choices. We finally found rooms in another hotel that would become available after a couple of days and told the manager that we would be happy to move. It was at that point that the manager said they would try their best and then found us a room with a view of the ocean (which apparently was an "ocean front" room). Bear in mind that even the "ocean front" rooms partially face other blocks of rooms due to the angular way in which the Westin Villas have been constructed. We have stayed in other resorts which had fully ocean facing rooms, but the Westin Villa's structure trades this benefit for maximizing the number of rooms which (theoretically) allow a glimpse of the ocean from at least some angle of the room or balcony. The manager promised to charge us (lower) "island view" rates for the first two nights that we were stuck with no ocean view. We asked to review the bill a couple of days early to make sure he had done what he agreed. Not only was the credit not given to us, but Westin had added so many debits and credits that the bill was incomprehensible. Of course, the total came up to be higher than what it should have been. The billing was the last straw. I had a fit because we lost so much time walking around the compound looking at different rooms, liaising with the staff about the rooms, looking for another hotel to move, and then trying to sort out the billing. In the end, Westin took off the room charge for the first 2 nights. Service - quality of service varies greatly from person to person. We have never seen such great variation at a hotel. I believe this comes down to poor management and poor staff training, and as a result quality of service comes down to your luck and the individual. The first manager snubbed us (his attitude was more or less "too bad, so sad" until we found another hotel which could accommodate us after the first 3 nights) whereas the second manager tried to help. Customer reps on their in house "service express" line can be very friendly or very rude. As an example, housekeeping forgot to clean our room one day. I called to ask for someone to come in 2 hours but was told to call back when I was ready. I said I will be ready in 2 hours. The customer rep repeated that I should call back then and hung up the phone on me. Housekeeping staff always seem unhappy. Cleanliness - poor. The housekeeping forgot to clean our rooms twice. When they did come, they only did the most noticeable parts, such as the bedding and the towels. They didn't always vacuum and never cleaned the countertops in the kitchen (unless they deliberately kept the mess on the floor and the countertop). Pots I pulled out of the dishwasher were not clean, when they did not just leave the used pots on the stove. They have even forgotten (giving them the benefit of the doubt) to clean the sink so it was filled with debris. Places such as the back of the make-up mirror were covered with dust. I normally would not have noticed that had our baby son not tried to play with every thing. Rooms - Of the ones we've seen, some are tired (two of the rooms we saw had sofas with threadbare cushions) and lack maintenance whereas others are new and reasonably nice. Ground - well manicured and pretty. It also has a nice pond with beautiful fish. Restaurants - only three, not many choices on their menus either. Food in all three is fine. Not spectacular but not bad either. Pools - a bit small for such a large compound. Beaches - good snorkeling, nice sandy beach with reasonably calm water.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.My very first impression of this hotel was via email, when I made arrangements with a nice hotel staffer to be picked up at the airport by the hotel's shuttle. When I landed, I followed the hotel's instructions and located the area where I was supposed to be met by the shuttle driver. No one was there. I found the hotel's airport hospitality booth and walked in to discuss my dilemma. Well, I learned that despite having provided all my flight details to the hotel to arrange my pick-up, the hotel policy is not to actually send the driver until you check in at the hospitality counter at the airport. This is utterly ridiculous and adds at least another half hour (waiting time) to your trip! For someone who had traveled over 18 hrs already, and given it was already after 9:30pm, this was a huge inconvenience and it also made me angry! Why ask for flight details if you're not going to have your driver be there at the airport to greet your guests? Nonetheless, I was stuck. The hospitality counter worker told me the driver would arrive in 15 min, but that 15 min turned into 25 min and I was still at the airport. I'd finally had enough and told the clerk to try to contact the driver again for an update. Well, turns out he had arrived but was waiting curbside for me and just never bothered to call the clerk to advise her. The clerk at the counter, rightly recognizing my frustration, ended up helping me tote all my bags through the airport, out the exit and across the street where the driver was chatting on his cell phone. Wow. And no apology, nothing, for being late. Later, when we arrived at the hotel, I tried checking in and was told the hotel wanted to bill my credit card up front for my entire stay. What? At that point, I was so exhausted I didn't care but I made it known that this was not normal practice and that it felt insulting to be asked to do this. I went up to my room on the 9th floor and was disappointed. The color scheme was orange and a garish marigold yellow. The bathroom sink, countertop and shower were not very clean. The countertop still had water stains from where someone else's glass had left a mark. The shower had hair in it. When I finally went to bed, thinking at this point that nothing more could go wrong, I was shocked to discover the bed mattress (if you can call it that) must have been made of steel. It was the hardest, most unforgiving, most uncomfortable bed I have ever "slept" in. I say "slept" because I was unable to get comfortable, tossed and turned all night and woke up sore. By the way, my "view" from this executive club room was atrocious...nothing but old, worn buildings as far as I could see. Trying to give the hotel another chance the next morning, I got up and went to the "club" floor to have breakfast. It was deserted. The waiter working there noted it would be better to go to the main dining area to eat because there was a better selection there (the club level had only cold cereal and juice available because...no one usually ate there...gee, wonder why!). He then offered for me to stay in the club area and that he could go down to the lobby area restaurant to make a plate for me. Not knowing what was offered for breakfast plus finding the request nice but weird, I grudgingly went to the main area to eat. This area was nice but not nearly as quiet or private as I would have liked (and as the club area was). Nonetheless, breakfast was decent and the staff there was nice. In addition to above and the generally, overall unpleasantness of the hotel, I also encountered problems with the level of noise at night on my floor as well as with the hotel's internet service. First of all, the noise...I stayed 4 nights here. On 3 nights, after 10:30pm, inexplicably, the hotel maintenance crew would work on my floor. Between their loud conversations and banging noises (coupled with the already totally unsleepable bed noted above), I was unable to fall asleep. Each night I probably called the front desk 2-3 times to beg them to help and to have their workers do their work at more reasonable hours. The staff always said they would take care of it but the noise lasted at least an hour each night. Completely unacceptable! Second...internet service..for USD 20 per day, you would expect fast and consistent service. Um, no. The hotel's server or network kept going down for hours at a time. This happened on two days. I asked why this wasn't fixed/addressed as guests were being charged a lot of money each day for a service which, essentially, the hotel was not providing. I got no response to this. Overall, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. There are hundreds of hotels in Dubai. Stay elsewhere. Oh, and to say this is a 5-star hotel is completely laughable. I'd rate it a 2 star. It was terrible.Extremely Dissapointing Punta Cana should really be renamed to PUNTA KAKA!! I was extremely dissapointed with my stay there and will never ever return to this country again. My husband and I took our daughter there july 20th thru the 30th, and needless to say we felt very unwelcomed. There were so many RUDE people that work there I really dont see how this hotel gets a 5 star rating. Let see where I could begin. .....We arrived at the airoport and were treated like we just invaded the dominicans. They make you form a line and snap their fingers for you to approach and take a picture with 2 girls. Next you pay $10 tourist card fee ( never heard of that before) and 3 sec later anther guy at a booth takes that card, scans it, and says NEXT....so in our case $30 are gone. I still dont know why. When we got to the hotel check in was pretty quick and easy and by the way if you need a safe( which most of us do) you pay abt $45 for the week. The rooms were pretty ok the beds were bad but we didnt excpect serta mattresses either. That night we ate a the buffet , which was ok, but the service sucked. We were left sitting at our table for abt 10min before a waiter came to greet us and offer us water. It usually took abt 3 requests to 3 different people for you to get a cup of water, and we didnt speak spanish either so that was a strike against us. I have never seen so many spanish tourist from Spain, so many French tourists in my entire life. THIS COUNTRY CATERS TO EUROPEANS...if you are looking for a nice time and to be treated how you should.THIS IS NOT THE PLACE. We have been to Mex. 3 times and LOVE IT....I will never go back to Punta Kaka!.....There were a few supervisers that were awsome...Juan Carlos at the buffet always was there to help us, Ilma Nunez was a lobby bar superviser, Maribel also a superviser...AWSOME...the bartenders Rafael , Rudy , German and Agustin AWSOME...Milquea excellent waitress...all the pool bartenders were great also. The grounds are beautiful ....BUT too big of a hotel...we never saw the entertainment team....there were a few managers that would walk by you and didnt even acknowledge you , not even a HI....Chino and Tony were lobby mangers I believe and I would never give them that position..there were others that deserved to be a manager. Oh and also when we went to book our a la carte dinners ( we got 5 since we were staying 10days) it was a nightmare. We were in line for an hour. People were just scattered around the room there not waiting their turns as soon as one couple would be finished with their reservations, others would jump up in front of people that actually were in line. We told the girl there they should ask that people to form a line and not just scatter around, and she just kind of shrugged her shoulders and dissmissed it. The a la carte dinners were good, buffet had different stuff everyday. We came to the conclusion that this wasnt a place for americans. Europeans did not understand the concept of sanding in line for anything!!!!! They would cut in front of you, didnt say excuse me or sorry if they bumped into you or anything at all. There are soooooooooooo many things I can go on and on and on, and I know it's already a long review, but I cant believe we spend so much money and we didnt have an excellent time. It's a shame such a beautiful hotel to have such poor service. This is the last incident I want to share....On our 6th night our usual waitress came to us almost in tears and said she couldnt serve my husband his drink any more. All he drinks is beer with a bit of lime juice and salt. THATS IT! It wasnt a mixture of different alcohols. She told us manger yelled and screamed at her for bringing him a drink that wasnt on the menu. Mexico had no problem offering this drink!!!! then my husband was told if he wanted that drink , he had to go to the bar and get it himself. So he did. Well after 2-3 times the bar all of a sudden couldn't serve him the drink. They filled up a glass of beer cut up some limes and gave my husband a salt shaker. Basically they told him he had the ingridients so he can make his own drink. We were furious!!! This drink has been served for 6 days and all of a sudden it became a problem? WHY? we asked to speak to the person who put a stop to the drink and of course they sent some other manager who tried to explain that the drink is not on the menu therefore it was a big problem to serve it......After about an hour of back and fourth arguing he said let me talk to my team and see what I can do. UNBELIVABLE !!! The next morning he shook my husbands hand and said he can have his drink until we check out and also they moved our waitress from the lobby to the swim bar because he said they have to punish her somehow for serving us that drink. HMMMMMM I thought customer service and satisfaction is # 1 priority ....but I guess not in punta cana!!! You probably think we are exagerating....but I promise you all....we were not the only people that felt this way....We couldnt wait to get home!! A lot of people we met felt the same...so if you want to take a chance and waste about $4000 .....good luck!!!! We definitly won't go back there, MEXICO caters to america and we will stick to Mexico... Never had any problems there WHATSOEVER....And what pisses us off more, we tipped everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Think twice about visiting this resort ...It was our first and last time there...Stayed here on May 14th with my husband. Disaster from the start. Completely disgusted and would never stay here again nor would I recommend it to friends unless they had a demolition licence. Check-in is stated as 2pm. We actually arrived early and called in to see where the hotel was, and was told to return at 2pm which we did. After checking in we were asked to wait, our rooms were ready at 3pm. Our room was situated on the 1st floor, and we were directed to use the back stairs to get to it. Carpets and walls were stained throughout the tiny narrow corridors, and walking past the kitchen there was a rather unpleasant smell. Traversing the corridor is made all the more fun by the obstacle course of abandoned hoovers, piles of laundry, and black refuse sacks left in random corners. All doors squeaked, creaked or banged (including the one situated right outside our room) . The room... Tiny room. This would have been easily overlooked given the age of the hotel, were it not for the disgusting condition of the room. Walls, carpet, curtains and base of bed stained repeatedly throughout (bed appeared to have water damage). Damaged, mis-matched furniture, broken and stained. Very sharp broken edge on the desk. Open screw-holes in the wall where a headboard had obviously been removed, and many other holes in the wall where pictures, fixtures, etc had obviously been removed. Stained, mis-matched bedding, very old, blanket pilled and tatty, and the bedspread appeared to be a single attempting to cover a double bed. Dirty spare blanket in the wardrobe (strange smell in there too), but no spare pillows. Two flat, stained pillows on the bed. Window latch falling off, window impossible to close without balancing precariously on the edge of the bed. TV very old and dirty, had four poor-reception terrestrial channels, no sound on any of them no matter how high the volume was turned, and no remote. There were NO fire regulations/directions anywhere in the room at all (every drawer and wardrobe was checked). I was under the impression that this was illegal/against regulations? No air-conditioning, and building work made spending any time in the room with the window open unbearable. We tried to grab some sleep that afternoon which we found impossible due to the building work. VERY noisy, building work and cleaning staff (believe it or not given the state of the rooms they actually have a cleaner, we saw her) during the day, guests crashing around and noise from the street at night. No instructions for phone, ie how to contact reception/other rooms. Back of radiator clogged with dust and dirt, and smelled bad. No lock on bathroom door, door handle didn't work properly. Broken/cracked tiles and very dirty grouting, particularly in corners. Floor very uneven. Toilet seat broken and wobbly. Pedal bin not working. On closer inspection realised this was because the lid was completely detatched and balanced on in position to make it look as if it was still attached. Toilet took at least three button-pushes to complete a proper flush. Larger persons squashed up (ie, actually touching both sides) of wall and shower cubicle when using the toilet. Water pressure passable. Taps on sink very stiff to turn, especially cold. Towels were clean, with a nice fresh smell of detergent, however the bath towels were minute. As I was taking all of this in in my husband found the crowning glory to our stay...A Rentokil Rodenticide trap behind the bedside cabinet. *shudder* Husband and I both slept fully dressed on top of the bed covers to avoid having to actually touch the horrible bedding. On check-in the receptionist was very helpful, and the lobby appears much better than in previous reviews, now being finished in white marble with leather furniture for guests and smart reception/concierge desks. Initial appearances give no indication of the horrors within. Concierge was surly and with (it seemed) very poor English. I skipped breakfast at the hotel ("mouse traps in the rooms, what's going on in the kitchen?!" mentality), however my husband's review: Had to wait 20 minutes for a table. No bacon in cooked breakfast. Poor toaster, had to put bread through twice to achieve a decent colour! Only one person clearing tables. No recognisable brands on display. Yoghurts not cold. During our stay my husband stopped in at reception to purchase two bottles of water from a fridge beside reception (water or cans of Coke, no prices on display). Member of staff behind reception charged him Â£3 cash, didn't ask for a name or room number. When it came time to check out, two bottles of water had been charged to room service on our friend's room next door. On trying to explain that we had already paid cash, we were met with a grilling on time of purchase, who did we pay, what did they look like, how much did we pay, suspicion and assurances that "If the takings do not show Â£3 up, your booking card will be charged." Our complaints about the room and specifically the mouse trap were literally glossed over, our comments were not even acknowledged the receptionist continued the conversation with "Thank you for staying, enjoy the rest of your day." Also the hotel attempted to take payment four days before we were due to check in from the card left supposedly just to hold the room until we paid on check-in. After putting the money "On hold" on the card (takes five days to get it lifted), staff then attempted to charge us again and deny that they could simply use the money that they had put on hold, despite us having an e-mail from the hotel confirming that this was possible. Badly maintained and badly run. Overall I was completely disgusted with the hotel, there is no way in hell this is a three-star hotel. Had we had another option we would have checked out immediately after seeing the room, unfortunately we were stuck.I wanted to plan a trip for my Boyfriend and his Twin Brother for their 26th Birthday. We are originally for Orange County, CA so it was going to be quiet an expensive trip to gather a group our closest friends to travel out to Vegas with us. Having monthly comps at the Palazzo we decided to go outside the box and try a hotel stay at Encore at the Wynn. We were extremely excited after viewing how elegant and nice the hotel is on their website. We decided to plan the entire stay at the Wynn. Club Tryst on Friday night and Club XS on Saturday night. This is so we would never have to leave the hotel. I had arranged the whole weekend the week in advance to ensure that everything was set in stone with our stay at the Encore. At check in, the lobby area felt extremely clutter due to the fact that they do no host an employee to direct any one person to a check in station. Upon check in, each guest is supposed to wait in any given line we unfortunately stood in a line with a guest who took 25 minuets to check out. When my party got to the front I told the check in host that I wanted to check in for 3 rooms on my reservation but leave the key cards up front so when my friends came they could pick up their room keys without checking in. The host had me write down each person’s name myself so she can have a key card ready. I had originally booked my stay at the Wynn’s website so I was surprise to know that my reservation rate was changed upon check in. I had to wait around 25 to 35 minuets for the host to fully check me in since she had to rebook my stay and get manager approval at the rate I booked on Wynn’s Website. This was very annoying. You walk into this hotel come to find out that you are already starting to have problems. All 3 rooms were booked on the same floor. Unfortunately my room was booked next to a room that had a barking door, THAT NEVER STOPPED BARKING. I don’t even believe dogs are allowed in the hotel. I am not certain. The room is small compared to The Palazzo. Nothing too special about the room except that it is modern and updated. The restrooms have no vents so when taking a hot shower it steams up the whole room. There is only one TV for the room and one for the bathroom. Which in other hotels I receive 2 flat screens and 1 in the bathrooms. So that night we went to Tryst. We were placed at a outside deck table, when we specifically asked to be inside. The table host stated that unless we tipped him or bought 2 additional bottles we would not be able to be sat inside. Due to the fact that we were going to have bottle service at XS the next night we wanted to keep simple for the first night so we decided not to tip the table host $200.00 and keep our table. To be so blunt about a bribe I was very shocked. I received a call around 11:00pm while at Tryst from a friend that was staying in one of the 3 rooms. He stated that he was unable to check in and I would have to leave Tryst to check in for him. I couldn’t believe that the original check in host did not do her job, but now I was being asked to leave the Tryst night club so I could check my party in. I asked my friend to hand over the phone but the check in host stated that I would have to come to the front or call in. I called in and my friend was able to check in. Come to find out when he checked in, the host upstairs gave my friend the key to my hotel room, not theirs. How would you feel as a guest barely checking in to your hotel room to find that the room was being used by someone else. The immediately got on the phone with guest services stating the room was already used and to bring a key to their suite immediately. It took them 25 minuets. WHAT HORRIBLE CHECK IN STAFF THE HAVE. The next night we went to XS at 9pm to get our table. The table host blew us off and made us wait in line foe 3 hours. Then around 11:30 they stated that all the tables were given away and that all they could do was free entry. WTF right? We had a table reservation, we waited in line and they treated us like crap. I was furious by that time. The next night I check out of the Encore totally sadden by the customer service. I called into the hotel asking for a credit with Hotel Correspondence. They stated that I would hear back within 5 to 6 business days. I did not hear back in 6 Business days so I called back again. They still did not have an answer. Then I called back a 3rd time and still no results. All in all the service at the Wynn, Encore, Tryst, and XS are horrible. I will never stay their again due to the help that they hire to run there table service and check in. I cant believe my boyrfirends trip was ruined due to Table Host who would not treat a hotel guest GOOD unless they were tipped under the table.This hotel began its life managed by Mandarin Oriental in the mid 1980s--the Mandarin fan logo remains engraved in the front windows on the first floor--was a Delta hotel for many years after that, and most recently became The Metropolitan. The location is great, just five blocks from the harbour, and a block away from both the Vancouver Art Gallery as well as the new Canada Line directly to the airport. If you are a fan of Mandarin Oriental, that this hotel was up to their standards at one point might surprise you. Then again, over two decades have passed, and when it opened, The Mandarin in Hong Kong had small rooms as well (though recently thoroughly renovated and enlarged). Everything about this Vancouver hotel--other than your bill, potentially--is small. The lobby is likely no larger than your living room at home, and the guest rooms (mine was dubbed "Luxury" and was an upgrade from "Deluxe) are compact to the point of verging on the claustrophobic. Think somewhere between a luxury cruise ship cabin and a dollhouse. It is a credit to the designers that the room works despite the lack of space. Nearly everything is built-in. . .the closet, the drawers, even the nightstands. While the room is large enough to accommodate a king sized bed, the television might be the smallest flat screen I've ever seen in a hotel room (possibly larger than one you would mount in your kitchen, but just), and the balcony is barely large enough for one person to walk onto. The bed looks more comfortable than it is--great duvet, but some might find the mattress overly firm. Nice carpet, good upkeep, umbrella and bathrobe are nice touches. A hotel of this calibre should have wireless internet, and The Metropolitan does not--but the broadband works well. Construction on a 50 floor residential tower next door means the noise starts at 7:30a most mornings--light sleepers might look elsewhere if rest is important--and the progress on the tower (just beginning) means that the noise will continue for at least another year. The 14th floor room had a view over gardens and pool at the Four Seasons across the street, but not much else--nearby towers are too high to afford the rooms at The Metropolitan views of mountains or harbour. The bathroom is floor to ceiling marble tile, and has a separate tub and shower--but it may be the smallest four fixture bathroom anywhere--in part to a barely usable tub, and a tiny shower enclosure with a head that might not be much higher than 6 feet off the ground. The decor was elegant 25 years ago, but the mirrors and smoked glass around the shower are beginning to date. There is a phone in the bath. If you like your luxury paired with spaciousness, this is not your hotel. I've stayed at the Renaissance, the Pan Pacific, the Sutton Place, and all three Fairmonts in Vancouver, and this is noticeably the smallest room of the bunch. I could overlook small rooms all the same--but can't overlook small minded hospitality, This is where The Metropolitan fails. My rate included parking as a promotion. With my plans changing slightly, I contacted the hotel as I'd not be using a car during my stay--and therefore parking was not something I needed. Parking, by the way, is $28 nightly, so four nights of parking is worth $112--not inconsequential. I sent a note to reservations via e-mail, and waited nearly a week without a reply. Finally, I sent a second note to follow up. A reservations agent then sent a note, rejecting my request for coming up with something of equivalent value--I initially suggested breakfast instead. Since this was worth over $100, I then followed up with the GM of the hotel, the once controller now acting as GM, Ms. Ahmadi. She had one of her associates call me back to yet again tell me that my rate was too low, and they had no interest in providing any substituted value. As it was now the day before my stay, I kept my reservation, and the hotel never did provide anything to substitute the parking. And the GM never deigned to communicate with me. Still hasn't. This small minded hospitality disappoints me. What sets a small hotel apart from the rest is the individualized service provided. it is not unreasonable that when a guest calls the GM, that this individual returns the call him/herself. And if the room package included, for example, a fruit basket and a bottle of wine--and I were not a wine drinker--it is perfectly reasonable, perfectly in keeping with a true luxury hotel, that I might request a bottle of sparkling water instead. A real luxury hotel, where hospitality came as commonplace, would make such a replacement immediately, without thinking--of course, it would reply. Failing to honor such a small request reflects the hospitality of bean counting--making sure that nothing is provided, and every extra is charged for. If the beans balance, things must be fine. Of course, this is a false economy when the guest experience is compromised. Which brings me to the next item that reflects the sad slippage of a hotel that had a Mobil Travel Guide Four Star rating but lost it over the past two years. The hotel charges guests a $9 "facility fee" per night. What, you might ask, does this include? I'm not quite sure, as the fee was never disclosed or explained on check-in. Believe there was some mention of internet (again the broadband, plug-in rather than wifi) or the health club--but the front desk agent was kind enough to remove it when questioned at check out. If it does include the health club, such a charge is even more offensive--as the "club" is the size of a standard hotel room, and includes a few aged exercise machines, some barbells and dumbells, and an exercise ball. The room is so small that a few more machines have been scattered around the south end of the indoor swimming pool. It will not surprise that the indoor pool is, well, small. Small rooms, small facilities, and a shrinking sense of hospitality. Stay elsewhere.Worst Place I've Ever Been! I recently returned from a week at the Blau Natura Park Eco Resort and Spa and was very disappointed to say the least. I live in Vancouver and booked my trip through Flight Centre. I booked this as a single person. I found when I got off the plane I was the only person going to the Blau Natura Park, which was interesting. It seemed that other people knew something I didn't. A lone bus came and picked me up. The guy driving didn't speak English. We went over a bumpy road to get to the hotel and when we arrived it was difficult to get any attention since I was a lone female without a male with me. I quickly found out their society is very male-dominated and I really had to try that much harder to get things like my air-conditioning fixed or get the electricity working in my room, etc. Anyway, I got a ground-level room even though I booked a top floor room because I was told the Sunquest guests only get the ground floor rooms. They don't tell you that in the brochure. Do not ask for anything at this hotel, because you won't get it. I made several requests throughout the week, ie. a bottle of cold water, towels, a doctor to come see me for a visit, etc. and none of my requests were ever fulfilled. You are on your own at this place. You just have to fend for yourself and learn to be self-sufficient and not ask for anything.FOODFirst, the food was repetitive. There were similar selections of cabbage around the buffets, or potatoes or something else. I didn't find too much variation. I have been on other trips to Puerto Vallarta with wonderful food at half the cost. They just don't put their energy into making great food here. Most everything was either shredded or cubed. You have to find your own cutlery, glasses and napkins, too if you arrive after someone's used the table before you. I got quite used to just coming in and assembling the table myself first before going and getting any food. I lost weight during this vacation.HOTEL ROOMThe hotel rooms are quite hard to find at first because everything is hidden behind palm trees and there are dark, low-lit pathways between them. My electricity went out one night and I called the front desk to get someone to come and turn it on but nobody came. I had to call 3 more times and it took about an hour before anybody arrived. I left a tip for room service every day, but found the room very inconsistent. Sometimes I had towels, sometimes I did not. Sometimes the bed was made, sometimes it was not. They also hassled me about leaving my bag in my room the day of check-out. They wanted me to pay to have it sitting in there for 4 hours, even though they could have certainly made up the room anyway. They said I was told to be out by 12 on arrival, but I am certain they did not tell me that. The Sunquest tour rep Brigitte was not there the entire week.SERVICEBe prepared, nobody speaks English here. If you go alone, you will definitely feel lonely. The tourists are 90% German or French. You hear them talking, but don't hear anybody speaking English. I finally found somebody from Newfoundland to take my picture. It was interesting because she had friends who came from Atlantic Canada, too. They all paid less than half the price I paid. I figured that was why nobody comes from B.C. but any Canadians you find there are all from Atlantic Canada and they keep to themselves. The service personnel will not answer you unless you talk to them in their language. I learned a few words in Mexico which I used here. The service staff did not seem happy. Also, they seemed kind of overworked because I saw the same people doing many different jobs around the property. Be careful not to accept glasses at the beach bars, they are not cleaned and I got food poisoning the first day I was there because of this. The man who told me changed hotels immediately, as did another two friends that he told. I stayed, however, but kept away from the water and the glasses while I was there. I tried tipping, but this didn't make any difference to the service you got while at the bars or restaurants. BEACHI liked the beach, but since I couldn't talk to anyone I found it to be quite lonely. I really envied people who could speak to their friends or mates, but I wasn't French, German or Spanish so I just read my book. Make sure you get a spot early by putting down your towel on the chair. Sometimes this doesn't work, though as I had my chair and towel used by someone once, even though it was a different colour than the hotel towels and I brought it from home. There are games during the day or dancing classes. If you want to book the water sports you have to go straight to the counter at the beach and book days in advance. Snorkelling was not good anywhere at this site. I paid the deposit of $20 cash and went out two different times, but didn't see anything substantial. I am a snorkeller and wouldn't recommend this site for snorkelling to anyone, so if you're after snorkelling, please don't waste your time.OVERALL IMPRESSIONMy overall impression was great disappointment. They call this place an eco-resort and even advertised a wellness buffet on the list of perks but I found it difficult to see how this fit the description of an eco-friendly resort. The food was not governed by wellness principles and it all seems to me a scam just to get people to come. Don't waste your money! The wildlife on the premises was nice, but that was all! The food is gross, the air conditioning is disappointing and good luck getting any towels! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and I've been around the world. Please don't sink your money into this complex! Don't say I didn't warn you!Wyndham Should Be Ashamed I have never written any kind of review of a hotel before, much less a negative one鈥ut this hotel changed that. There鈥檚 no denying that the hotel is in a great location, but the staff made sure that we will never stay in any Wyndham property ever again. During this nightmare experience, we discovered that Wyndham is a franchise and Wyndham, apparently, isn鈥檛 concerned about how absolutely appalling the service here is. You might be even more surprised to hear that they don鈥檛 always have a manager on duty!On arrival, our room wasn鈥檛 ready: 鈥淭here are some people who haven鈥檛 checked out yet and we like to clean them all at one time.鈥?We good-naturedly agreed that we鈥檇 walk around and come back. The Front Desk Clerk, Keania, wouldn鈥檛 take care of our bags; she told us we鈥檇 have to take them back across the lobby to the doorman. When we returned later, we found our bags sitting unattended in the lobby. Keania asked me to sign a form that said we were staying for only one night. I had booked through Wyndham Vacations, for two nights, and had already paid in full. She told me that Wyndham Hotels, the Bourbon Orleans and Wyndham Vacations don鈥檛 talk to each other. (I had similar trouble when I enrolled in Wyndham by Request and tried to add my preferences to my existing reservation. They told me this was only for stays booked through Wyndham, even though I booked through Wyndham Vacations, from their website. It took 3 e-mails to straighten that out, but the Bourbon Orleans doesn鈥檛 talk to them either 鈥?none of my 鈥渞equests鈥?happened.) She said I would be charged and they would have to amend my reservation for a second night. When I asked for the number of Wyndham Customer Care, she didn鈥檛 have one: they don鈥檛 talk to Wyndham. I asked for a manager and was surprised when she said it wasn鈥檛 their policy to have a manager on duty; one would be there at 9 am. Then, she then gave me the card of 鈥淣ight Manager鈥?Kevin Granier. We got to our room and found a maid still vacuuming. She left and, unfortunately, also left bits and chunks of Styrofoam all over the floor. There stuff from a previous guest in the bathroom. The countertop, etc. and mirror had not been wiped down. I don鈥檛 want to think about the likelihood of the sheets having been changed. At this point, I unpacked my itinerary and went back to the front desk. Keania said it was meaningless. 鈥淭hey have nothing to do with us.鈥?Since there was no manager on duty, I asked to speak with her supervisor. Her supervisor, Doniella, was standing next to her and had been there the whole time. Doniella said to Keania, 鈥淭ell him that we have no way of knowing if he paid.鈥?Since she was directly in front of me, I asked her to speak to me directly. She raised her voice: 鈥淚 just told you鈥︹€?which, of course she hadn鈥檛; she told Keania to tell me. She couldn鈥檛 be bothered to speak with a guest of the hotel. She said she would need to see a copy of my credit card statement. I, naturally, didn鈥檛 bring financial recorsds on my vacation.While Keania and Doniella were busy not giving a damn, my roommate was changing in the room and an employee came in without knocking or announcing herself. This invasion of privacy was very upsetting. She said she was there 鈥渢o see if the room had been cleaned.鈥?Back at the front desk, Keania suddenly announced that, despite not knowing we were staying two nights, they had tried to charge my card repeatedly and it had been declined. I assured her the charge had gone through in February. I said I apparently needed to talk to corporate headquarters. This time, Keania was mysteriously able to find a number for Customer Care. Doniella had long since disappeared.While navigating Wyndham鈥檚 automated system, I found my printed receipt. While I was on the phone, my roommate took this down to try his luck. After more rudeness from Keania, he actually got an apology from someone with housekeeping. She told him the hotel had no way of knowing if a room had been cleaned. After the front desk rudely told him that I didn鈥檛 have this receipt with me earlier, they promised to reduce the charge for Saturday night and send up breakfast vouchers for Sunday morning. How a receipt from Wyndham Vacations was more valid than an itinerary from Wyhdham Vacations is a just another part of the mystery. The vouchers were eventually sent up but, naturally, no credit for a reduced rate has appeared on my credit card.Meanwhile, customer care told me they had talked to the hotel and told them my bill had been paid: no one would speak to me again about any charges. Great! Time to calm down and enjoy this fabulous city. As we settled in, we discovered no minibar key, no ashtrays. When we finally got the key sent up, there was stuff missing. Another call to Keania鈥攄on鈥檛 charge me for stuff I didn鈥檛 use. She said, 鈥淚鈥檒l tell them鈥?and hung up. As far as I know, the minibar was never restocked. It took two more phone calls and a half-hour to receive a single ashtray: a woman pounded on the door, held it out without so much as looking at me, and walked off. I should note that the hotel did send up a split of red wine and a cheese tray, I suppose as some kind of pathetic apology. That evening, I called housekeeping for extra pillows. 鈥淲e don鈥檛 have extra pillows.鈥?Click. The next morning, my roommate went down to use the breakfast voucher. I was pretty much done with this hotel. When he got to the restaurant area, he waited at the 鈥渨ait here to be seated鈥?sign. The maitre d鈥?eventually looked at him and shrugged, like 鈥渨hat the hell do you want me to do?鈥?When he said he was waiting to be seated, the man just walked toward a table, pointed, and walked away. When I checked out, Keania asked me if I wanted to keep all the charges on my credit card. It was clear she had absolutely no recollection of the entire episode. Apparently, abysmal service and upset guests are so commonplace they鈥檙e easy to forget. I told her I鈥檇 been through all this with her before; I owed nothing. She eventually told me I was 鈥渇ree to go.鈥?As I鈥檓 sure you can imagine, this 鈥減ermission鈥?to leave didn鈥檛 improve my mood.I wrote to Wyndham and the general manager of the Bourbon Orleans a month ago. The only response I鈥檝e gotten was an e-mail from 鈥渃ustomer care, 鈥?with a brief, inaccurate summary of my issues attached, that said the general manager would be contacting me. Bottom line? The Bourbon Orleans is staffed by the rudest, most obstinate people I have ever encountered in the service industry and Wyndham couldn鈥檛 care less about the quality of hotels with their name attached.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

It's garbage.The sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone.For the price you pay for the food here, you'd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants.I was just in New York for a 2 day interview so I wanted to stay someplace inexpensive yet not too far away from the office I had to go to (near Grand Central). My mother and I looked online and saw that Hotel Pennsylvania had a reasonable rate and was in a good location. I arrived at the hotel late Monday night and stepped out of the cab into a rather motley mix of people, some not so appealing looking. But I chalked that up to the area probably being a hangout for teenagers and whatnot. I walked into the lobby and it was the same thing. I wasn't worried, however. Sure there were more random people walking around the hotel than I was used to, but it was near a station after all. Most hotels would ask non-patrons and loiterers to leave... but I shrugged it off. In the midst of my check in, a man came up to the front desk yelling about some problem that was supposed to have been resolved already. He had an unfamiliar accent so I couldn't make out just what the issue was. I did notice, however, that the front desk girl conducted herself rather unprofessionally. But I figured it was late so she was probably tired and frustrated by now. I wrote it off. I headed for the elevators where I had to show my room key before I could even enter the elevator area. This was the point where I actually first braced myself. While this sounds like a comforting security measure, I've been to hundreds of hotels all around the world and have never seen such a practice. I found myself a little wary wondering why they would need such a precaution. Maybe the area wasn't as safe as Time Square where I usually stay. When I stepped off the elevator and onto the 4th floor, I knew with a sinking feeling that my time there would not be pleasant. I was hit with a rush of stale cigarette smoke. Apparently my non-smoking room was on a smoking floor which rather negated its efficacy. The hall carpet looked as though its original color was buried underneath quite a few layers of dirt and grime. Stains large and small were everywhere. I was a little frightened of seeing so many stains considering that the lighting was inordinately dim and further hampered by a mist of smoke. If that's what I could see, how much was I missing? Many of the directional signs to the rooms where hand drawn as quite a few of the signs had fallen off probably long ago. What was even more fun for me, there were no signs to my room at all. I had to roam the dark, dank hallway aimlessly. Fortunately I found it just before I was about to go downstairs to complain. Many of the doors to the rooms were covered with some sort of green, plastic decoration. It's hard to describe, but they were obviously old and tattered. Quite a few of the doors were missing them and the ones that were still hanging often had holes. I arrived in my room only to find that my carpet was filthier than the carpet in the hallways. So filthy was it that I never took off my shoes. There was a double bed with an obviously worn bedspread, an armchair about 30 years old that looked as though it had never been cleaned in all that time, and a desk that looked only a few years old but that had a chair whose cushion was already covered in stains. As I walked in I immediately smelled the musky odor of mold, and soon I found ONE of its sources. There was a little mini-fridge of the floor with black mold visible on the outside of it. I was horrified. I timidly entered the bathroom hoping for a bright spot but afraid of something worse. The towels and washclothes were folded on what looked like the type of bathroom shelving you'd find in a high school locker room. The problem was that the holes that were part of the shelving design, probably meant to prevent water buildup, were full of rust and dirt. Apparently noone at this hotel had ever heard of LYSOL (fortunately I had and came armed with a bottle). I read one review where someone walked into a room there and it reeked of bleach, they were appalled. Me, I only wish I'd had the smell of bleach in my room. I gingerly pulled back the shower curtain to spray the area with Lysol, only to find that no amount of Lysol would convince me to bathe myself in such a place. There was no plug for the drain so I could clearly see the corroded, rusted, and dirt encrusted area around and inside it. The enamel on the tub was cracked and peeling in many places, creating partially opened crevices where it was impossible to clean. Maybe if the whole thing had been soaked in pure bleach..... From what I saw, either the tub wasn't cleaned after the last guest (or few guests) or whoever cleaned it didn't know how to do their job. To be fair, maybe they were just as grossed out as I was a preferred to avoid it. All I wanted to do was survive till morning when I could find other accommodations. I went to the window to close the curtains (my room looked into another room) and I happened to glance down at the ancient fan/heater attached to the wall. To my horror and nausea even now, the vent was filled with mold, grime, dirt and only the Lord knows what else. It was black with layer upon layer of filth. Absolutely disgusting and I'm sure a health hazard and code violation of some sort. It's just as well the window was stuck and didn't close because I felt I would rather freeze all night than even let my pinky touch the dial on that contraption. And I did. I spent a restless night hearing people come down the fire escape through my hopelessly ajar window. I'll try to cut this longwinded story short on only mention in passing things like the stains on the inside of the bedspread, the filthy ironing board, the lack of a bolt lock on the door, and the fleas. Needless to say I hightailed it out of there early in the morning. I checked out a couple of housekeeping carts on my way out and noticed that there were no cleaning products whatsoever. There were only refills of toilet paper and changes of linen. Actually, this place was such that you had to put a sign on your door saying that you wanted them to clean the room to get service at all. They have a $50 early check out fee that got waived for me, which is just as well for them as I was appalled enough to make my complaints known which is something I'm usually loathe to do. I ended up staying at the Comfort Inn on 46th St. which turned out to be $10 cheaper a night, almost on the corner of Times Square, closer to my interview, and CLEAN. Granted, I had just left hell so anything else felt like heaven. I know others have mentioned that their in the midst of renovating and that some of the rooms are ok. But as for me, I wouldn't take the risk. Friends don't let friends stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania.Staff and management attitude here is very bad overall. Leadership is abysmal, and is reflected in the outrageous treatment given to the guests by the employees. First, let me say this is a beautiful hotel and there are a few very good employees (especially the people who clean the rooms). However, for the most part, the employees reflect the worst attitudes possible in the service industry. 1. ATTITUDE. NO ONE SMILES. In fact, there appears to be a significant effort on the part of employees behind the reception counter, and in the restaurant, to avoid smiling, even when charming customers from various countries are smiling at them. 2. ATTITUDE. EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT ARE RUDE. Employees behind the reception counter act as if it is a great inconvenience to them to have to listen to a customer. They interrupt before they know what the issue is, and they treat customers rudely. Again, not all employees, but most. 3. ATTITUDE. CUSTOMERS ARE THE PROBLEM. There is no effort to fix problems, but, rather, to make excuses for why they can't be fixed, especially at the management level. The bell hop dropped my computer monitor. I reported it to security and they took a report. I heard nothing more about the incident. The next morning, I walked by a bell hop I believed to be the one who mishandled my monitor. He said something like "two, two, two." I didnâ€™t know if that was a curse, or if he was saying something to the man next to him who was on the phone. It sounded more like a spit than words. 4. VALUE. YOU GET HALF OF WHAT YOU PAY FOR. There are two kinds of hotels. One provides a bed, the other provides a wonderful experience that makes guests want to come back, and to tell their friends. This hotel provides a bed (plus a bad experience). I can't recommend it to anyone. 5. GRATUITIES (TIPS). GRATUITIES ARE MANDATORY, NO EXCEPTION. Gratuities are automatically added to every check, at the bar, and in the restaurant, even for one person. There was no clear answer about the percentage rate of the tip, only that it was â€œminimal,â€� whatever that means. This allowed the employees to take a "could care less" attitude, and most did. The occasional employee with excellent social skills gets screwed out of a good tip. 7. RESTAURANT. RESTAURANT SERVICE IS RUDE. Waiters walk away while the customer is ordering, the music playing is most inappropriate, and is set to produce the familiar echo of over-amplified third-world radio stations. When I asked one waiter if the tip was included, he quickly said it was included, grabbed the bill and my credit card and disappeared. The two numbers at the bottom of the check that looked like they could have been tax and tip weren't labeled, and seemed way out of proportion. He didn't bother to show me the tip, or tell me how it was calculated. The only thing that came back with my credit card was the receipt for my signature. I was in a hurry, so I didn't question him on it. It made me feel like he stole from me, even if he didn't. 8. BAR. THE BAR IS BORING AND FRUSTRATING (BECAUSE OF THE STAFF, NOT THE GUESTS). I was at the bar for about an hour one night. There appeared to be two bartenders. One was constantly away getting food for the bar, while the other sat in a chair at the bar doing paperwork. The two employees appeared to be at each other throats. The bar was full, and people were upset that they couldnâ€™t get service. But why should the bartenders provide service when their tips are automatically included in the bill? The bar environment would drive any employee crazy (and the customers hated it too). There was disco music playing from the PA system and a loud TV playing in the lounge area of the bar. It was the most pathetic bar experience I have ever had. 9. COMPUTER ACCESS. SOMETIMES THE WIRELESS NETWORK PROVIDES PLUG AND PLAY ACCESS. I was given a wireless network bridge to attach to my computer so I could use the wireless network in the hotel. This is a free service to customers with computers. For 8 hours I worked with the people providing bridge service via a 1-800 number. Most of the time was spent waiting on them to get back to me. Finally, they had me change out the equipment at the desk, and that solved the problem. They guy behind the desk said "you should have just brought it back right away." That wasn't helpful or fair, since one of the people at the desk told me to make the calls to the support company. 10. VENDING. THERE ISNâ€™T ANY VENDING. I went to floors 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 18. Those are the floors with soft drink machines. Not one of the machines worked (see pics). This was reported to management on the first day I was there, and it was that way when I left. On the last day, I bumped into one of the bell hops in the elevator, and even he knew there were no soft drinks to be had from the vending machines. The hotel manager whined that he could only advise the restaurant that the machines needed to be filled. But why should the restaurant fill the machines that charge $1.25 for a soft drink, when they sell the same soft drink from a refrigerator in the restaurant for $2.00, plus never having to work to keep the machines filled? The boutique/store in the hotel is forbidden to sell soft drinks. 11. HOUSEKEEPING. HOUSEKEEPING IS GREAT. The housekeeping staff did a marvelous job. They were very friendly and courteous and the room always looked great. Out of 5 stars (5 being the highest), this one gets a 1. The housekeeping staff kept it from getting a zero. It could have been amazing, but it wasnâ€™t even mediocre.Pros: Good shower, low price, good dresser space. Cons: Lousy service, lousy functionality of room features (tvs, phone, etc.), freeway noise, inept management, lousy housekeeping, overwhelming odors, dirty lobby entrance, garage a questionable hang-out spot. Now here’s my story: From the website and the price offering this seemed like a great idea for my ongoing visits to LA to spend time with my son. How wrong I was. Here is how it all went down: Upon arrival, seemingly odd bit of sustained "hanging out" of folks in the parking lot (ground floor below hotel), something you'd expect more in a 7-Eleven parking lot, not in a place billing itself as a hotel and spa. I'll add that this continued throughout the visit. Also the cigarette butts stubbed out in the parking lot were numerous as was evidence of fast-food garbage and spent cans of beer, here's an idea, if that many people are smoking and hanging in your parking lot maybe a trash can and ash tray might be in order. The check in process was mildly encouraging, seemingly nice front desk. The room itself was at-a-glance on par with what you might for a newly appointed hotel. Nice bathroom with a clever sink and newer bed and linens but the floors are not really wood, some kind of plastic vinyl situation and this kind of is a common thread throughout, the room, faux, it kind of looks good but isn't really. The room was also a bit dark, but there was a patio. But a patio with a spilled Starbucks plastic cup and a big chocolaty coffee stain, which was not cleaned or removed during the whole visit. Room faces freeway on ramp. I get settled and unpacked and head out with son for a day together. Back in evening, flip on TV as is my habit pre bed in hotels. Blue screen, no signal. Try other TV. Nothing. Two remotes one not working. Since I am now in my night clothes, think best to call down to the desk and explain the problem. Hotel phone not working. Give up, go to sleep. Next AM. Try TVs. Nothing. Phone still dead. Get dressed, head down the hall with heavy scent of what smelled like about a kilo of fresh cut marijuana, seriously. I'm not one to just toss that out there, but it was pungent and breaking through the overload of air freshener they use in the halls. For what it's worth, the next day I didn't smell the dopey smell again, only the air freshener and that was noxious. Anyway back to the second day after a night and morning of no TV, no phone. Go to front desk and gently explain I have some problems. Desk says this will be fixed today. Can’t fix it now because only the maid knows how to fix it (?) and she’s not here yet. I give her my son's cell and ask she call and let us know when all is fixed, so I can be reassured because my confidence is a little off kilter. Son and I head out for the day. Hotel calls, says all is fixed except the phone, phone can't be fixed. Something about needing multiple vacant rooms in order to fix the phone in this room, and by golly, they’ve been full since they opened. Do I have a cell phone or should they move me to another room? I say, “oh no need to move, I have my cell”. It's fine, I can deal with this. Back at hotel after dinner. Son and I have doubts so he comes in to check the room with me. In lobby, manager is there, seems nice. Make some small talk about the NBA Finals and then head up to the room. Try TVs. Neither works. Phone still dead. Son and I head down to see the manager. Manager says it’s a new property and that’s why he took the time to come in on the weekend. He says he knocked on the door earlier to address the problem, but we weren't there so he couldn't fix it. We try and explain we addressed it earlier and Hotel called and said they fixed it. He kept cutting us off as we tried to explain the situation. He says he’ll come up to the room and fix it. Explains on the way that people sometimes misuse the TVs and that’s why they’re hard to use. Comes into room, adjusts something on back of one TV (voila, it works!), then tries the same trick on the other. No go. Tells us that remote control for second TV has no battery, that's the problems there. Would we be ok just using the one, ok sure. And that he is sorry but these things happen, we are all human after all. And would we like for him to buy us a drink. No thanks. How about some champagne he offers. No thank you. After he leaves I prep for next morning and find the coffee pot hasn't been cleaned. Ugh, so I clean it. Son leaves and asks to speak with manager, front desk staff say he is upstairs helping a guest. Son waits, and sees manager walk in from sidewalk outside hotel. Upstairs huh? Son meets him outside and explains coffee situation and asks if that is normal for this hotel? Manager explains that no, he is sorry and happy son isn't cursing at him, and that we are nice people, and that, “maid must have lost her mind” and offers to clean the room personally. And again offers champagne and drinks. No thanks. Son asks that his mom’s room and stay be without incident forthwith, could he see to that? Yes he says, he could do that. Next two days are without much incident. We say hello and goodbye and are polite but the earlier snafus are never mentioned by staff. Never see the manager again, although he is on premises. In the comings and goings the staff just seems sheepish, incompetent, and basically clueless. Last day there, back after an evening with son. Close to bedtime for a nice 65 year old lady. Knock on door. Manager wants to give me a bottle of some kind of champagne. I respond I don’t drink champagne (I honestly don’t). Guy at door tries to get me to take it, but I tell him no till he finally leaves. Checked out the following morning. Once again, the parking lot seems to be a hangout for folks who may or may not stay at this hotel. Me, never going back. And I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to hotel stays but in this case, fellow travelers need to be warned about this place. PS: At one point the manager offered a reduction in room rate. Haven’t heard from him on that one since I left. ________________________________________ No virus found in this message.Horrible honeymoon expirence My new wife and I stayed at this hotel for the last 3 days of our honeymoon.Check in was fine, but when we got to our room it reeked of cigarette smoke. We went down to see if they could do anything, and after telling us the whole hotel was non-smoking, and this was very strange, they offered us 2 solutions:-Someone could spray the room (basically with a can of Glade)-They could set up an air sanitizer, but we'd have to leave the room for 3 hours.We picked the air sanitizer solution and walked around for a while (it was 3PM) and then went out to dinner. When we got back to our room after 10, there was a little device that looked like a dust buster pumping chlorine gas into our room. My wife made me read the bottom and it said to evacuate the room of people, animals, and plants when you use it, and to thoroughly air out the room when finished. Had she not been there, or had we not spoke English (a majority of the hotel clientele was Japanese), they might have been sending for a body bag the next day.We took the device to the front desk and told them the room was uninhabitable (It smelled like an over chlorinated pool and the air was making us light headed). They said there wasn't anything they could do, so they'd send someone up from housekeeping to help us.The guy they sent was told he was to pick up the air sanitizer and nothing else. He spoke very little English but I got the idea that he wasn't able to help me get a new room, and I needed to talk to a manager.We went back down (it's getting close to 11 now, so we've been unable to use our room for 8 hours) and told them, again, that the room was uninhabitable. I was left to sit and wait 10 minutes as the lady helping me talked to her manager. They offered us free breakfast and an ocean view room. I'm not really one to argue a lot, so that sounded ok. In retrospect, it hardly seems compensation for almost killing us. The lady assured us that the room was non-smoking (yes, I know, we were told earlier the whole hotel was non-smoking... by the SAME LADY) and had an ocean view. By a little after 11 we were in our new room.Our room with a parking lot view, on the opposite side of the building from the ocean.So I went back down to ask them where our promised ocean view was. The lady pretended she didn't know where the room pointed, and looked it up slowly on a chart of the hotel. She then talks to her manager again for 10 minutes and come back and said they were all booked and we could get upgraded the next day.I'm to tired to fight, so I go upstairs to go to sleep. At least this room didn't smell like cigarettes or chlorine.The next day we ask for our new room and the lady helping us added an extra word to our promised 'ocean view'. That word was 'partial'. I was told 'ocean view', and I was given 'partial ocean view', which translates to 'if you lean out over your balcony, you can see a glimpse of the ocean'.I was so sick of that front desk I couldn't take it any more. We gave up and stayed 2 nights in our 'partial ocean view'.When we went to leave, another surprise came up. We had used our laptop's modem to connect to the internet at the promised '$1 connection fee for local calls'. I left it connected so we wouldn't have to pay each time. The extra charge was $100 for using the phone, because somewhere in small print on the back of the card that told us '$1 connection fee for local calls' was a disclaimer saying there is a $0.10 a minute charge over 1 hour.The whole experience was a nightmare and ruined our honeymoon.But the fun didn't end there. I am forgetful at times, and I accidentally left my glasses in one of our many rooms (admittedly my fault). I called back a week or so later and got a very rude person in housekeeping. She was very curt with me and wasn't any help at all. She said the glasses weren't there.I called again a couple weeks later and spoke to someone much nicer and more helpful, but still no glasses.Then, just recently, my wife called to ask one last time about my glasses before we blow another $200 on a new pair. The lady was extremely rude and short with her, and even hung up on her!I understand bad things happen and stuff goes wrong. People forget things and mistakes are made. I understand that, but it is how the staff decides to handle these things that determines how I feel about them. I feel as though this staff didn't even want me to come back to the front desk, let alone the hotel.Never again will we stay at a Sheraton, and everyone we know now knows this story. I am sad that there is no 0 star options for this review because that is what I would give this terrible hotel and it's rude, lying, incompetent staff.Filthy rooms, bedrooms caked in dust as if they hadn't bothered in years to be cleaned await those who check-in to this property. The Suites are horribley small, and are not true suites. Regular Rooms are simply one room with a cheap partion, with an area that has an ottoman chair. We complained and paid 30 bucks to upgrade to a 'premium' Suite, which was still not a standard hotel suite, again a room with a partion that was broken and didn't close all the way, and left two feet gap between the cieling and and again a cheap thin partition. Amazing these guys call themselves a Suites hotel. Maybe they should go and at least look at a hotel like any Embassy Suites (which are far far superior), or for that matter the Pacific Palisades Suites in Vancouver itself. I was amazed that an earlier posting someone wrote that the Fairmont Group owns the Delta chain, what a stain on their reputation for running such a dump as this hotel, two years ago we stayed at there Hotel Vancouver and Empress in Victoria, I wish the could bring the same high standards to their Delta subsidary). We usually stay at the Palisades (part of the superior Kimpton Group) which has huge full suties and a lovely pool area. The Delta's Pool requires a huge hike to get to, where you find a filthy pool and spa, both with thick black growths of mold growthing on them. The Delta seems to think mold is in fashion or something. Our bathroom and tub and bathroom tileing had disgusting growths of black mold. The Delta has a placard in there bathrooms saying that they guarentee clean rooms, or your first night is free. This is a claim they do not honor and is silly for them to have anyways. Why dont they act like there compitiion and just offer a clean room each and everytime as a matter of professionalism and normal cleanlyness in the hospitaltiy industry. As a owner of several apartment complex's in California, the health department here would never let a property open their pool area with the gross mold they have growing everywhere. Avoid the gym as well, or you are likely to leave with a staph infection or catch some other virus. We returned in the evening to our room having found the maid, who again failed to clean the mold and dust in our room had turned the Air Conditioning on FREEZEING, at least she left a a mint by the pillow, a Claritin for alleriges would have been more appropriate for those allerigic to mold and dust. Upon going to bed I turned up the heat since the room was so cold. A couple hours later the room was still freezing so I turned on it top heat. The heater alas was broken and needed serviceing and 3 A.M. in the morning I had to call the hotels maintaince department to fix the heat in our room. After waiting close to an hour the maintaince man finally came, another hour for him to fix it. He told me this happened 'all the time' after the A/C had been on, that since they recylce the air, the heater gets full of water and has to be drained. I had enough, I went to the hotel's "business center' to reserve a Suite at the Palisades (for a cheaper price and superior product). By the way, the 'business center' had three computers, but only one worked. It made me wonder if anything worked in this property. Luckly the Palisades had room for our next three nights we where spending in town. What a relieve to be able to get out of this property . Amazingly upon checking out we found the check-out staff aincredibly unproffessional and rude. It was if the women who checked us out named 'Chi-Chi' was experienceing her first day at work or maybe was sent from a Temp Agency to fill in for the day. Though she had a record of filthy room we got, she knew of the mold in their pool, -as she informed us they share it with the condo complex next door, and the hotel was 'pondering' closing "their" pool as the condo complex regularly leaves in uncleaned with mold and bacteria and who knows what. We informed her that if their own hotel cleaning staff was incapable of cleaning the mold in around the batthtubs in the room, the pool would still be the same. Anyways Chi-Chi, said there was nothing she could do as we had booked our room through Hello-B.C. , which is part of the province's Tourism department, and thus could not honor their policy gurarentee of a clean room or hotel facilities, but she was happy to throw in her totally rude and unprofessional service for free! I have written to Delta's "we listen" customer service department but have recieved no reply so far and it has been over six weeks now since our stay. Lastly, this is hotel is located in Vancouvers worst nieghborhood, Gastown is full of filth and drug addicts. The hotel purposely Locks its front enterance on Hastings St. for security. Thus you must enter the hotel through the garage breezeway to get into the hotel at night. Do yourself a huge favor and stay in a safer neighborhood, like in Yaletown or on or near Robsin Street, i.e. like the Pacific Palisades where your are close to shopping, restarurnats and nightlife, the dodgey neighborhood of the Delta offters none of this come the weeekend when the area is deserted. I could right more on our horrible experience at the Delta and its lack of a response of our letter to their customer service department. Vancouver is a beautiful city as we found out once we moved hotels, don't ruin your vacation by staying in this filthy hotel or its filthy neighborhood.You get what you pay for... Let me start by saying that I have travelled extensively to nearly every Carribean Island. I have taken 7 cruises to the Carribean, as well as stayed at resorts in Aruba, a few islands in Hawaii and Mexico. I have travelled to underdevelopped areas in the Carribean, and was prepared to encounter some unpleasant roads along the way and also aware of the stomach issues that may accompany travelling in a foreign country. When I became interested in travelling to Punta Cana through a recommendation I did as much research as possible regarding the best resort for my stay. After reading all of the reviews on the website and others I thought the vacation was fool proof. Unfortunately, that was not the case. My experience might be an isolated incident but I must warn anyone thinking about going to lower their expectations, and take into account that these things might happen to you. First off, food poisioning. I made sure to not drink the water and only drank bottled water. I stayed away from any type of fish, and rarely drank alcohol. However, on my third day of vacation I ate at the lunch buffet. Out of all the vacations I have ever been on I have never found food to be of such low quality. Time after time I tried to eat the food, but found it was stale. They never changed over the food. They had a bin of french fries and nachos which were completely stale. Within a few hours I was vomitting. I should have used better judgement and not ate anything at all, but the choices for lunch are really limited. Beyond the buffet of stale food, there is only one other restaurant to eat at which is a sit down restaurant.Breakfast was the same story. On my first day I was impressed at the assortment of pastries, and got a whole plate full only to almost break my teeth on stale donuts that were hard as rocks. It was truly disgusting at points.In addition to the food being a MAJOR disapointment, there were quite a few other things that really detracted from this 5 star resort. Cleanliness...not up to par. The room had ants in some places. As I type this, I am scratching bug bites all over my arms and legs (I did wear OFF! spray daily) but apparently there is nothing that can stop them. A day after coming home, I realized that the bug bites have actually gotten worse.Also, the housekeeping staff did not measure up to a 5 star resort level. They never once in our week stay changed the small towels in the room. The bath tub had hair in the drain on the first day we checked in. Every day we would have to ask for beach towels because they were never put in our room. Upon check in, our fridge had the remains of the last guests drinks in it. That had me wondering, if they couldn't even take the time to clean the fridge what else they may have not cleaned or prepared for us. Room service...became yet another pain. On our second day we called for breakfast at 8:00 am. We were told it would take an hour. We called back an hour later to see where the food was, and were told it would take another half an hour. So, if you want breakfast room service, make sure to order it two hours in advance. Also, you really cannot arrive late for anything. On our last day we left our room at 10:55 AM because we were both not feeling well. We wanted to try to just grab a little bit of food for the ride to the airport or for the wait for our transfer. Upon walking into the buffett we saw tons of people sitting and still eating, and others at the buffett taking food. Within a moment a man from the resort came charging up to us insisting we leave because it was closed. We tried to explain that we weren't going to sit down and we just wanted to take a muffin or something to go. I understand that if a restaurant is closed that he has every right to ask us to leave, but the fact that others were clearly still getting food from the buffet showed the true level of service the people at the resort are willing to give. He told us to go to Lobster House...which was not a possibility since we were leaving within the hour.The staff were friendly, many of the bartenders or other staff were extremely nice people and I geniunely enjoyed meeting them. However, I would by no means describe the service they provide as above average. Many times we asked for certain tables in a restaurant (and witnessed the same thing with other people) and were told it was not a possibility. The tables with nice views of either the ocean, or a window seat would be entirely open and set up (in an almost empty restaurant), but some excuse would be given. In my opinion, if I go to a restaurant and would prefer a certain table for whatever reason, it shouldn't be a problem. I saw this happen many times to both myself and others, and it is mind boggling why the staff are so unaccomodating in making people happy in this respect. It almost seemed as if the staff were bothered by requests sometimes, and after a while we just gave up and settled for tables in corners while simply looking at clean, empty tables with gorgeous views in envy.The TV rarely ever had a signal. At night we would be in the middle of watching the news or some other show, and the TV would just stop working. We called once to report the problem, after the 2nd time we just gave up.Bottom line is that the resort is beautiful. It's a rough and rocky trek to get there, but once you do, the resort is beautiful enough to take your mind off of what you've went through to get there. However, the food and the service is not worth the money. There are plenty of other islands in the Carribean that have resorts with edible food, and 10 times better service.By the way, I have noted that any review on this website that isn't positive is usually noted as not helpful. Of course many people may have had a great time and not had the same horrible experience I had, but I think it's best potential travellers get the chance to see both ends of the spectrum of possibilities they risk travelling to Excellence. Many others have given positive reviews on this website and others, but a few others have really not had a positive experience at all. I think it is important to recognize that if something does not go smoothly at this resort they are NOT accomodating and are very uninterested in helping you out.If you're someone who likes to judge a book by it's cover, then Paris will create an amazing first impression. However, once you actually start to look inside the book, some less than favorable things will start to surface by the end of the first chapter. The positives? Paris is one of the few hotels on the strip that really shines when it comes to establishing a theme and carrying it through. The common areas are beautiful and do a great job of making you feel like you've traveled across the pond to France. There is a great amount of attention to detail and the casino common areas and promenade between Paris and Bally's are just lovely. Overall the food is quite good. The 24-hour cafe and selections from room service were very tasty. The Burger Brasserie, situated just outside Bally's, was a great, quick choice with burgers and fries that kept us coming back several times during our stay. And best of all, the Burger Brasserie's prices are a great value for the quality and amount of food you get. Also, the drink service in the casino area was among the best I've ever encountered, you never go thirsty while playing and the cocktail servers are very, very sweet and professional and remember what you like to drink day after day. Mon Ami Gabi is just a magical place to eat. If you can sit outside, it's worth the effort and wait. Dining while the fountains are dancing across the street is unforgettable, and the food and drinks are among the best for the dollar. The business center staff are to be commended. Unbeknownst to myself, two of my credit cards and my social security card fell out of my wallet while I was rummaging through it at the business center. The clerk found them after I left and called by room to let me know. So nice to know honest folks still exist. The negatives? Quite a few I'm afraid. 1. At check-in, you get the feeling you're at a used car lot trying to get a good deal. Make a request for a room upgrade (even when willing to pay extra for it) and you'll find that they're "totally full" and "nothing's available." However, the mere appearance of a $20 bill in your hand subtly placed on the counter causes miraculous things to happen. I'd read about this trick from other's experiences on this board, and sure enough, once I let the front desk person notice the folded bill, we went from having a low floor, bally's roof view to a 28th floor fountain view, recently renovated, corner "p" suite... at no extra cost. I feel bad that I helped promote this practice, but it did work. Ultimately, it's just bad business for mgmt to allow this to happen. First come, first served ought to be rule. 2. The place just can't handle crowds. The shopping/dining promenade between Bally's/Paris simply can't handle the traffic with numerous bottlenecks that make you feel like you're in line for theme park attraction. Want to eat at the buffet? Be prepared for at least a one-hour wait for (at any time of day, even 2-3 pm). Aside from breakfast, it's a buffet experience that's as average as they come. At one point, the line stretched from the entrance of the buffet to just before the Burger Brasserie, which is about 50 feet from the Bally's entrance. According to the signs, that would be at least a 2 hour wait... for a buffet. These lines for the food establishments also exacerbate the crowding of the walkway and trying to navigate the crowd will quickly try your patience. This lack of sufficient dining capacity is a major, major miss for a hotel this popular. 3. Daily upkeep. On our first night (Monday) we ordered room service. Once finished, we placed the tray outside our door as people normally do and rang room service to have it picked up. The next morning, it was still there. And guess what? It was STILL there the next morning. The tray sat there until 11:30 am on Thursday and it was joined by no less than 2 other trays down our hall section (both there for more than a full 24 hours). That's just unacceptable. Not even the maids acted on it. Imagine the pest problem that could lead to. Inside the room, there was an obvious white stain on the red coverlet on the bed. Any maid paying attention to what she was doing would have noticed it and replaced it with a clean one. We called and asked for a replacement and never got it. We removed it from the bed and each day we found it placed back on the bed after the room was cleaned, the stain still as obvious as ever. 4. Prices. For room service, a burger/fries and two soft drinks came to $28... and gratuity was not included (as most hotels do). Complete and utter rip off of the guests, especially when the same meal at the cafe or burger brasserie is less than $16. 20 oz bottled soft drinks? $3 each. 10oz glass bottled soft drinks from the mini-bar? $4. 5. The 31st floor lounge. Huge rip off. $45 a day for two guests gets you whole/sliced fruit, croissants, toast, coffee, juice and some less than edible smoked salmon for breakfast. For evening, you get cold cut finger sandwiches. Glass of wine? nope. That's not included. Save yourself the money. Have a 3rd in your party? It's $10 per extra person per visit. All in all, I just felt totally taken advantage of at Paris and not well cared for or appreciated. I've stayed at most of the larger properties on the strip, and I won't go back to Paris, except maybe to play and to eat at Mon Ami Gabi. It's such a shame. There's a ton of potential and you WANT to like the place. At the same time, you leave feeling like you paid far, far more then the value you received for it.Believe it must mean "terrible, rundown motel that tries to pass itself off as a resort....and bring some ambien if you want to actually sleep". That phrase (though wordy) sums up this place perfectly. Not going to spend a lot of time on things like lobby (who cares) or location (it is really in the middle of nowhere - end of a pathetic 'island'). In sum, this place has no business attempting to pass itself off as a resort. In my opinion, it is misleading and false advertising. From other reviews, it sounds like this place was good in it heyday. Sadly, those days are long gone. At best, this is a fancy Motel, like a step above Motel 6. Let's call it Motel 6.20. If I had to sum up the room in a single word, it would be 'dump'! Old and outdated are the least of its problems. After you drive your car around to the building where your room is allegedly located (yes, think HoJo style here), you enter a semi-enclosed structure. There is no signage or other direction to indicate if you are in the right place. It is simply trial and error to find your assigned roon. After getting on the elevator for the short trip to the second floor, I had to avert my eyes from the filthy carpet in the elevator. Upon entering the room, the stench is the first thing to greet you. After that, it is all downhill. Walk past the tube TV and you encounter a terribly sagging, U-shaped bed, as well as similarly shaped desk chair (and, oh yeah, the chair cushions are stained as a nice bonus). The beds are abysmal. During the night, I was fully expecting a spring to pop up through the mattress and impale me. Also, you better really like the person you are sleeping with because the laws of gravity, along with the terrible beds at this place, will guarantee that you spend the entire night - like it or not - attached to them. There is simply no escaping the valley of the U mattress. For the most part, the rooms appear clean, but do not be fooled! For a clean freak like me, it is notable to point out some very major deviations in this regard. First, the bedspread...yes, you read that correctly - they still use bedspreads. As all of the 20/20 and other investigative interviews have revealed, a hotel bedspread should essentially be burned immediately since they are so nasty. Not at kona koni....instead, there, they take the bedspread and cover the entire bed, pillows included. So....your pillow is tainted with bedspread nastiness from the get go. After you muster up the courage to remove the bedspread, an equally nasty and worn "velvet blanket" is revealed. As anyone born before 1976 can confirm, these are those nasty velvet things that pill and get gross with each washing. I thought they were banished from the face of the earth, but fear not - you can find a full supply at this Motel. At this property, you have an added bonus - they contain the hairs (head as well as hairs from other body parts) of prior guests. This all sets the stage for a great night's sleep. Speaking of sleep, good luck. First, the pillows; or, rather, the "pillows". These are nothing more than pillow cases stuffed with a layer or 2 of miscellaneous stuff. I call them "pancake pillows" That is about how thick they are. Second, no need for an alarm clock if one of your neighbors rises riser earlier than you. When a neighbor showers, it feels like you are in the middle of the pipes where the water is running through. While I did not hear the actual guests talking, I could tell when they showered or washed their hands. The sound is so loud you feel like you're in the middle of a waterfall. Third, the lovely holes in the towels are really nice. Enough said. Fourth, if you are handicapped - or get put in a handicapped room - good luck in the bathroom. Apparently, at the Kona Kai, physically challenged people don't have needs for shelves or cabinets or counter space in a bathroom. I had an accessible room. The only place to put my toiletry bag was on the shower chair that is used for disabled people. Fifth, the heating/AC unit. It is at ankle length and appears to emit only one temperature regardless of its setting. Sixth, outlets. They are original from 70's or 80's - be prepared to get creative in getting your electronic device to stay plugged in. The outlets are so old that they barely hold any charger. Also, as an added bonus, they are all about ankle high and out of the way. This is a business traveler's nightmare. Speaking of business travelers, they claim free internet. Well, you get what you pay for. In the common areas, it works well. In the rooms (where you probably need it the most) it is slow and unreliable. This place advertises a spa. There was a flyer attached to the key jacket that boasted a "neck, shoulder, back, foot and leg massage" for $70, usually $90. This type of massage you can get at major airports for $20 bucks. This is not a real massage or a real spa. In any event, you will need a whole lot more than a half-baked massage after a stay at this Motel (I am even being kind calling it a motel). They should throw in a free week's worth of chiropractic treatments after suffering 1 or more nights at this place. Service at the bar was good....once the bartender showed up. Warning....her martini doesn't taste like it, but it is quite lethal ;) Restaurant....service and food delivery were rushed. However, when you wanted a refill on wine you had to set yourself on fire to be noticed by the waitstaff. Food, at best, was mediocre. Bar and restaurant close at 10 on Friday and Saturday nights....really????!!! Suffice it to say..this place is so bad that I would sooner stay in my car than stay here for the night. It is really that awful.Run from this property like a bat outta hell!! I don't even know where to begin. I usually take all reviews of places I read with a grain of salt. I know sometimes people can be unreasonable in their expectations but am I sooooo sorry that I did not take all the negative reviews on this property into more consideration!Booked two rooms for a four night stay. I knew and I had read before I booked that the property was under renovation. Since I was booking months in advance, I was hoping the renovations would have been finished by the time for my trip and I would be walking into newly renovated and refurbished rooms. Well . . . WRONG!! Got there about a quarter before 3 pm and they guy at the front desk, whom I had seen outside and had taken him to be a maintenance guy, was dressed in the most wrinkled uniform shirt I've seen someone wear - not professional at all. I think it was at this point when I started to worry my worst fears had come true that all the reviews were TRUE about this place. Was told at the front desk that they did not have the list of rooms that were ready to be assigned. I know that check in time for this place is listed as 3 pm but all other hotels I've stayed at have been very accomodating in assigning me a room even a couple of hours before their check-in time. So I decided to wait to be assigned a room and unpack before heading out. Noticed while in the lobby that it was pretty warm. By the time I got back to the front desk, the shifts had changed and there was a different guy there who assured me that the air conditioning was only a problem in the building with the front desk since they were still working on renovations for the restaurant. He told we would have no problems whatsoever once in the rooms. I asked him if the room renovations were complete and he explained that they had decided to wait for the busy summer season to be over before starting on the rooms. I braced myself for the worst at that point. Got the card keys and went into the rooms assigned. With as much objectivity as possible, I have to say that the rooms were very clean. Maybe the carpet was spotted in some places but overall, the rooms and bathrooms were clean and they do have some very nice Bath  Body Works products for the shower. They also have pillow top mattresses which make for very comfy beds and the shower heads are new and good for showering. Then I noticed that the rooms had shear curtains but were missing the heavy sunlight blocking curtains behind. I thought that the side drapes could be moved but those were stationary. How can you assign a room with just shears when at night you can see from the outside into the rooms in the first level and in the morning you can not block the sunlight from coming in? The other room we had been assigned was missing that and the lampshades by the bed side - NO LAMPSHADES!! Besides that, even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room, it truly smelled of smoke in there. Then I noticed that the a/c wasn't kicking in even though I was lowering the thermostat into the 50's. Called the front desk and explained the situation and that I wasn't happy with the rooms I had been assigned. The person at the front desk was quick in re-assigning us to different rooms at which point we had to pack up our bags and go back all the way to the front desk to pick up the new keys. The second rooms were better, they were cooler and the heavy sun-blocking curtain was there. Why these rooms had them and not the others, I don't understand! Headed out to take in some sights and we were back at our rooms by 9:30 pm. The a/c system was not cooling the rooms at that point. I was about to call the front desk when the fire alarm went off. Grabbed the most important items and joined the rest of the guests in exiting the building. A staff person from the front desk was going around asking guests to return to their rooms and that it had been a false fire alarm. I decided to go to the front desk to complain about the malfunctioning a/c. I can only describe the scene as chaos when I got there. There were many guests just screaming and complaining about the whole situation. There was this lady who had mentioned the alarm had gone off two nights before. Another gentleman was demanding to be moved to a different Red Lion. The front desk was getting calls from the rooms complaining about how warm it was and all they were suggesting was for the guests to open the windows to let some of the cool air in. The poor guy at the front desk looked like he was going to lose it any minute and appeared to be on the verge of tears. I finally made my way to the front desk and asked what was going on with the a/c. He said he just did not know. Well, how was he going to handle the situation. He explained that all he could do was call an a/c maintenance guy to look into the situation. I explained I just could not and would not stay at a place without any a/c. He ended up not charging for the rooms for the night and I started to search the internet for another hotel to move to for the rest of my stay. It was a night of tossing and turning because of the warmth. I think at most I got 3 hours of itermittent sleep that night and was just exhausted in the morning. I just could not wait to leave in the morning. Red Lion hotels are supposed to be at least three stars but this one, because of the state that it is in, I can not even classify it as a motel. If you are considering a stay here, do not do so until you confirm that renovations have been completed. Shame on the new owner for not closing the place and completing renovations before opening up for business. I guess the negative reviews will continue on this one throughout the summer season.There might have been some things that I wold have been willing to overlook but the last straw were the problems with the cooling and what seemed might be regular false fire alarms. I can not comment on the breakfast, I did not partake since I just wanted out of there - FAST!!To say this was the worst vacation I have taken is an understatement. I frankly don't know where to begin but if you read no further know this: unless you are looking to show your spouse or significant other how bad of a vacation planner you are, stay far away from this place. Our family is pretty well traveled, prefers a higher end resorts with golf, nice staff, great service, good food, etc. Not much to ask for in general, but this resort had none of these qualities in our opinion. Upon arriving and noticing that we were the only people without tattoos, not from Canada or England, or that chose to wear bathing suits and tank tops to dinner, we knew we were in the wrong place. Nevertheless the weather was nice so we wanted to make the best of it. To suggest that this place actually has "management" is an insult to the management experts of the world. Most of the staff doesn't understand english, stares at you with a "deer in the headlights" look when you ask them anything requiring thinking, and is constantly heading you off to pitch you on upgrading your room to "the better part of the resort" (suggesting we booked the bad room to start"). My wife was constantly harassed by the staff trying to sell her on a 90 minute tour of "The Royal Club" which is nothing more than access to a bad putting green, a tacky room closer to the water where the sea-side terrain is so rough you don't dare take your kids there, and close proximity to what we called the "Fraternity Pool" which was constantly blasting AC/DC and other heavy metal as the lovely guests sat poolside smoking, drinking, and buzzing by the buffet like flies on a rib roast. One particular lady kept coming up to my wife saying "Miss lady, did you change your mind on the tour?" -every, single day. Then her colleague told us "Oh, she is new to the resort, I will take you on the tour". It was absolutely unreal. We literally saw the staff follow newly arrived guests around the pool asking them to sign up for timeshare tours, and the guest were trying to get away as fast as possible to no avail -they were met by additional staff on the other side of the bridge. The highlight was the female "concierge" sitting in the entrance to building 18. First thing she asked us "Ok, what do you want to do while you are here?" We responded "Relax and enjoy the weather". Her exact response "No, I mean what services do you want to pay extra for?". Then she told me that while the resort does not offer tours, she could "call her boyfriend and see what she could do for me to arrange an island tour". Then she said to my daughter "We usually have gifts for the kids but unfortunately we ran out". Then she said "but I do have a t-shirt for your wife to wear around to market for our resort". Oh yeah, she also told us that there is no other way to book a room at the Royal Club other than to take the 90 minute tour. Completely false as I inquired at the front desk just to get us away from all of the noise and blasting music but seems that it was already sold out. The tour desks in the main lobby are not connected to the hotel so there is no oversight for quality, or to protect the guests from buying services they don't need in advance. For example the Xcaret tour desk told us that we "had to buy the tickets for the dolphin swim with them otherwise we could not book it directly in the park". That was an absolute lie as we walked into the park, went to the reservation desk in the park and were swimming with the dolphins an hour later. The convenience store on the property has a cashier in there that is just about as nasty a person you will meet. There was a little guitar hanging on the wall -probably cost about $10.00. He said "Don't touch it because if you touch it and it breaks you will buy it". I could have launched into a nice New York City response but frankly he was not worth it. The food -absolutely horrible. The food in the Xcaret park was so much better...yes, a theme park has better food than the resort! Being a native of New York I ordered the New York Strip one night at the Sonoran Grille. That was just about the worst "steak" I have ever had. Essentially the food is exactly the same at every place on the resort property -simply with different decor from place to place. I didn't get sick luckily but the food is so bad that you really have to leave the resort to get a decent meal. I'm betting that folks who generally enjoy lining up at 6pm for a good buffet won't complain much. Oh yeah, you have to bring your wet towels back on your own every day otherwise the staff will not issue you new towels. I actually was in an argument with a towel woman by the pool who literally told me that I could not have new towels for my family and I had to escalate to three different people over the course of 30 minutes to get new towels! There are no newspapers or books sold at this resort so you better bring something to read, or be willing to pay the $5.00US for 30 minutes of internet time at the business center which runs about the speed of a 9.6 baud modem -when it works. Don't get me wrong, there are a few nice things about the resort. The pools are nice, clean, and well maintained. The bartenders are not a part of the hard sell for the time share tours, and the waiter staff are very prompt. Unfortunately there are so many really bad things that we experienced at this hotel that I would not only never, ever go back, we actually need another vacation now to recover from this horrible experience. The staff constantly asked us "what travel agency did you book your trip through?" and when I said I booked it myself online, I was treated like a second class citizen. Do yourself, your family, and your sanity a favor -don't let the website pictures fool you. Spend a few more dollars and stay at a resort that caters to people who actually want to enjoy their vacation and not feel like they just entered a 24 hour infomercial to sell you an extended horrible experience. But -you do get a nice vinyl Occidental totebag for your trouble to show everyone that you actually like this kind of treatment and poor quality.I arrived @ 10:00 off an overnight train from Venice but was told it was too early for check in, as the room was not ready. I was feeling ok, so I happily left my luggage in the hold room and skipped off to enjoy my first day in Paris as I didnt want to waste it waiting around. In fact I enjoyed it so much, I didnt return until 16:30 after walking all about. I was tired and really ready to settle in for a shower. When I returned the gentleman who I met earlier seemed a bit confused and he told me there was an issue with my room. I begged him to just give me another room and I can swap the next day. He told me if I came earlier there would be no issue as a man came before me. So i asked him if he gave my room away? He told me no, it was an issue with the shower and it is not their policy to allow me to stay. They organised another hotel, the hotels neighbouring (3-4star) were full. I didnt bother to check. I accepted it and pushed my luggage down the 2-3 blocks to Hotel Diana 2star. I was a little annoyed when i realised it was 2 star. At Hotel Diana there was a charming and very fluent english speaking man named Damian who asked me what the problem was. I went on to tell him they had an issue with my shower. He politely smiled and told me that was a lie, but a man called before stressed bc they booked a man last minute into my room. I figured that sounded more like it. I asked the gentleman to call back to Hotel Claude Bernard St germain to confirm in french with the man that I was not to pay for this night @ Hotel Diana NOR pay for the night at all as this was their error. Also that the hotel was to pick up my belongings and check it in the following day where I was leaving early to go to the Louvre for the day. This was confirmed so I knew there was not to be a mix up. I was told to just have breakfast at Hotel Diana and leave for the louvre the next day and on return go back to Hotel Claude St Germain where everything will be organised. The next day I left my luggage in the lobby and was met by a lovely lady at hotel Diana for breakfast. She also asked me what the mix up was. I told her the hotel said it was an issue with the shower. She said NOOOO... they called and said they made a mistake and she thought it was unfair and she didnt want me b/c I was expecting a higher star rating and it was not fair on me to get a 2 star and her only roomleft was her worse room. I told her Hotel Diana was fine and I was happy that even though they made a mistake they are looking after me.. she warned me to ensure I was not paying for the night at all! After my day at the louvre I checked in with the same man from the day before at Hotel Claude B St G. I checked TWICE with him that I was not paying for the night before (not paying the rate of his hotel or the other) and that he was covering my breakfast for the error. He said yes, yes. Dont worry and apologised. He also said he was giving me a better room - which i dont think it was better than what I booked but it was clean and I didnt mind or bother. From that point I didnt mind. I thought: hey they made a mistake, but they are looking after me so fine! The rest of my stay was pleasant. The breakfast was good. THe rooms were clean. It was on check out. Luckily I decided to check out 3 hours early so I could do some last minute trip to the shops and then catch my afternoon train to London. On checkout I realised i was being charged 86euro for the night at Hotel Diana. I was furious bc the manager Paul was called and he said there was "no way I would NOTbe charged for it. It was unheard of!" I was to wait 1 hr when he would come down to speak to me. I went down to Hotel Diana hoping to catch Damian who was the french man who confirmed my no charge for the night. Unfortunately his shift did not begin until 15:00. But i checked the rate of the room was 78euro but breakfast was 8euro and I was getting charged that. (so much for free breakfast) On return for the hotel the manager was still on his way but decided out of "generosity" that they would only charge 50euro... I was livid, but decided to wait for Paul and head out to do what I planned to do for the morning. WHen I eventually met up with Paul there was lots of arguing. They used the excuse of the other man not being fluent in english... I got it confirmed in FRENCH mate!! I may be a small young woman, but I am educated and do not like being bullied by such an arrogant manager as Paul who does not honour what his employees say to their clients and tried to say how his hotel found me a pleasant place and i stayed there and survived, like it was a gift for me! You can see from his "poor review" replies that he is always returning the blame to the client. I laughed at some that I have read just before writing this. His replies always seems to have an air about making the reivewer come across like they are really fussy, real whingers and complainers. FYI-I am pretty cruisey. I was willing to let the first day all go if I was taken care of. There would have been no complaints even though I was shipped off to a 2 star for the night, made to grab my luggage and lug it down the street - something the hotel should have offered to handle! After a lot of raised voice, poor words, I gave in and demanded they just print out the statement so I can pay and leave!! This was wasting my time! I was livid!! Paul some how came to his senses (maybe after i kept threatening to write horrible reviews on trip advisor) and decided that I was leaving on such a bad note and unhappy he didnt like that so took off the charge. But not before ensuring that by taking off the 1st night charge, I would leave "happy" and not write a bad review. Sure thing Paul! So I thank the Hotel ever so much for taking off the 1st nights fee at the pleasant Hotel Diana! It was such a generous touch! I hope the hotel takes this as a learning curve & ensures their staff don't say yes yes when they dont mean it, or if they do the manager says "oh well he shouldnt have agreed to it, but bc he has, I will honour it"... or maybe just DONT give out a pre-booked room to the next guy who will pay a greater rate!?!?!? However, if the whole ka-fuffle didnt happen, I would say the hotel was clean and pleasant. Look forward to hearing Paul's response.I thought the food isn't cheap at all compared to Chinatown.This is going to be a long review because I have a lot to say about the Vardar "Palace" Hotel and Istanbul for tourists. I don't like to complain all that much but usually when you are motivated to take the time to write a review online, it's because a place was great or not so good. This hotel and city gave me more of the latter feeling like it was all just a huge rip off to a tourist. I flew jn from Kuwait (I'm American working there for several years now) on a 3 day weekend short trip, to see the "sites" and experience the nightlife, picking this hotel because it was near Taskim Square and I read a few reviews that this area was loaded with disco's. OK so that was the plan, the airfare was only around 225 USD roundtrip so I figured I could afford it even if just for 2 1/2 days. First bad news was when I arrived, I flew into Sabiha airport (Jazeera air has great sale prices but I've now twice flown into smaller airports that are far away and you end up paying through the nose in taxi fare). The duty free place since I arrived at 22:00 and wanted some liqour (none in Kuwait), was the first rip off. They put the prices in Euro's and then rip you off on the exchange rate, by the time it was converted to US dollars on my credit card, two fifths of whiskey (one Chevas and one Johnny Red) came out to 120.00 USD on my credit card, not a great start. I think liqour stores are available in town so the duty free store was a mistake to do. Taxi ride to Taskim from Sabiha Airport, I read to make sure they use a meter Taxi, which I did. Cost for a 35 minute ride was 78.00 Turk Lira, then the driver said it was 90.00 Lira to pay for tolls, ok, that kind of hurt but what am I to do? Going back to the airport I was charged 58.00 lira for another meter taxi and no charge for the tolls, I tipped the secong guy but not the first feeling pretty ripped off, I never pay that much for taxi's anywhere I've traveled and I have seen a lot of this planet. Checkin into Vardar "Palace", the sign out front said something like your special place FYI, LOL! Anyway they had my reservation at the desk even though they never replyied to my emails to confirm the room like I asked. They questioned if I wanted a single or double room since I was by myself, I asked for a double so I would not get a closet to sleep in, happy I did that. Checked into a room on the second floor in the back, happy I got that as well. The front has no view and the traffic in the street is very very noisy. Room was clean and bed comfortable. I asked the front desk for an adapter plug so I could run my laptop, no luck on that. I figured that if I offered a tip I could get better service on the plug, the guy who worked at night after I said I'd give him 20 lira to find me a plug came up with a plug, imagine that! Now get this, he says its his personal plug for his cell phone and I could only use it for one hour! I asked him what time he got off and I got it extended till 8 am (its midnight when I got the stupid plug, no big freaking deal to find in the town during the day). So you get my drift that these people are kind of heartless and only out for a quick buck. Food inside this "4 star" rip off is another joke and you know how you can tolerate one bad thing (taxi), then two bad thigs (front desk idiot), but upon waking up for the "breakfast" it really set me off. They only served bread and cold cheap cheese and salami. I asked the staff for some cooked eggs (no meat , mind you just eggs as they had hard boiled eggs there) the manager said cooked eggs are only at the 5 star hotels! I loaded up a plate of cold cuts and cheese and left it on the table uneaten in front of all the other tourists there to show my displeasure, and walked out to McDonalds because I was hungry and didn't want any more Turkish surprises.They do serve cooked eggs at the Turkish McDonlads just not at the Vardar "Palace". Room service is available 24 hours 7 days a week, just drinks though no food, no drink list either so don't even go there or your really asking to be raped. I restocked my mini fridge with beers at the many stores in the street. Taskim has a lot of history, it seemed to be very old, the streets very narrow, I walked around a lot arriving on a Saturday night, went into about a dozen bars, usually one drink minimum for 6 to 10 lira cover charge. The typical "club" was a one story place about the size of a studio apartment in NYC and totally wall to wall people, a real death trip if a fire broke out and you had to walk always to the back through trongs of bodies t get to the bar, it reminded me of when I rode on a Tokyo train they were all that packed. I didn't see many torists, 95% Turks. The only Turks that spoke to me were hustlers in the street (At least 6 to 10 during my stay). They approach you talking in Turkish and ask for a light, as a lead to talk (I was smoking), I usually didnt say anything back but when ever I did, they always said, oh your not Turkish in English. This was ment as come on compliment and then it would be lets go have a beer. I blew them all off, I got bored my second night there and talked some more to see where it would go, it was just a come on to get into some rip off, I never went into a place with them. I did see Turkey, and although I spent 1,000.00 USD total with my airfare, hotel and booze and food and of course the high taxi roundtrip to Sabiha airport, for a 2 1/2 day stay it was a good learning experience, it sure beat the many times higher price I would have paid in airfare from America that I may have done later on in life, no I don't plan on a repeat visit to Turkey, lol. I rate the trip above Cyprus (at least I found some good food, unlike there), but the nightlife was nothing to write home about and the prices and people were expensive and looking to totally rip you off. If your working in the Middle East like me my favorite place has been Bahrain, pretty good value there and a much nicer Hotel with a nighclub, room service, pool and cheaper to boot!. If you really want to see Turkey see it for the history only and go in a pre paid tour only, otherwise buyer beware you will get took. I'm not sure the Vardar was bad as far as Turkish standards go but it was bad as far as WORLD standards go. Oh and of course they got me on the exchange rate checking out taking on another 30.00 USD for my stay then what I was quoted in Euro's on Booking.com. Just grin and bear it and move on. Attached are pics of my "view" and also inside the hotel they are using the lobby downstairs as a storage area for mattresses, also a pic of the 4 or 5 POLICE RIOT buses parked at Taskim square, they were getting ready for something!I should have checked out of this hotel as soon as I checked in and found other accommodations. However, due to the weariness of traveling, the late hour that I checked in, trying to get my bearings, getting over a cold, and figuring that all accommodations in Amsterdam were pretty much the same, I stayed. This hotel really soured my experience in Amsterdam, though. Again, my fault for not checking out and finding something else. I just stayed here for 5 nights in late Nov., the first few days of Dec. of this year, ('08.) Another poster said to call this a hostel, and advertize it as such, and I'm afraid they were right. It does not look like the picture on their website. Yes, the stairs are exactly like TA's pictures & like everybody else said. I'm up for adventure, & I realize that most everywhere in Amsterdam has stairs probably similar to this, but it felt like crawling up a ladder, to the point that I felt trapped several stories up & dreaded going down those stairs again. To be fair, the hotel is in a good location, just around the corner from the Red Light District. And around another corner and across the street to tour offices where you can meet their buses & take their tours. It is also a 5-7 minute walk to the main train station. Across from this station is where you catch the canal boat tours, as well. Also, it was not "youth hostel-like" in regards to a shared bathroom. It did have a TV in the corner of wall, near the ceiling; and it had a crisp down comforter/duvet, with down pillows; and they did come to clean, (although it did not feel very clean, except for the bathroom.) The room itself was tiny. Small does not bother me, as a huge part of traveling overseas for me is the charm of everything & the difference of things. But this hotel just rubbed me wrong in every way. Other hotels that I have stayed in, namely in Italy, had tiny rooms. However, they were clean, with amenities, & overall just very nice. This hotel just felt like a rip-off! I try not to take into account the Euro to the USD, but I paid the equivalent of 100 USD for this place that I felt was not worth it. After being fair about the good parts of this hotel, here goes the bad. There were no pictures on the walls of any sort, just a lot of scratches, & what appeared to be dirt or scrapes on the lower part of the walls. The walls themselves looked like someone needed to climb those "ladder stairs" with several cans of paint & put a few layers on the walls to spruce it up. Next, my booking said that there was a wake-up call available. This is usually not a big deal, but there were no amenities whatsoever at this hotel. No alarm clock. No telephone. And, I'm sure the girls at the bar were not going to climb 3 flights of stairs to wake up their guests. (My alarm clock stopped working & I had to search all over Amsterdam for a new one.) There was no end table, just a table in front of a mirror, with 2 stools pushed underneath it. I used one stool for an end table and wiped it with wet tissue paper, which came out black. Yuck! The other stool literally looked like it had a streak of dried vomit on it. Double yuck! There was also what looked like a streak of some kind of dried fluid, drink or some sort that dripped down the inside of the closet. The carpet was brown & just seemed dirty. Although I saw the girl with a vacumm, it just seemed like it needed to be ripped up & hardwood flooring put in. There was a safe in the closet as advertized, which I did not use. And a strange, almost industrial-like garbage can in the corner next to the door, which seemed dirty. It had a donut-type hole where you put your garbage in, which just seemed like it needed a good scrubbing. The shower got water out the door onto the brown carpet. So then it seemed like a dirty, wet carpet. A couple of days into my stay, I finally figured out how to arrange the shower curtain to be lower & hence try not to get the water out of the shower, as much. There were no drinking glasses, no tea/coffee, hot water kettle, no internet services. None of these things do I expect. However, I have stayed at places for a lot less that were wonderful, that you felt like you were on vacation and not "slumming it," and offered such abovementioned things, which just made the stay pleasant and pleasurable. Not at the Frisco Inn. Maybe if I would have paid someting like 35 Euro, it would have seemed tolerable and somewhat worth it. Also, maybe if they would have advertized truthfully, then I would have know what I was getting myself into? I figure that it is just possible that Amsterdam is expensive, like Switzerland, and does not offer value for your $. So be it. At least advertize as such, so that the consumer can make an educated decision. I don't know. I do know that this hotel really soured my experience there and made me really mad. From the get go, they charged my credit card the minute I arrived. Very strange. And not normal. I stayed at 6 other hotels in the timespan of this trip & every single one of them did not charge my card until the end. Only one put a hold on my card for the amount. Other normal hotels also have front desk clerks 24 hours. This hotel seemed like they were "double dipping" with the bar attendents hanging out having no concern for their guests. The day that I checked out & waited for my airport pick-up one of the bar gals asked if I would like something to drink. When I said yes, tea please, I was given a tea bag and hot water for 2 euro! I think the whole thing just made me mad. The bar was empty, with 3 bartenders, two on their off shift, making themselves different drinks, coffee, etc. & they couldn't even offer a guest something. (Again, other hotels that want to provide value & a service to their guests, lo and behold, have even offered breakfast with their rooms!) My feeling about Amsterdam is that most people just go there to party. At least in this section of the town. It seemed like why should the Frisco Inn provide any sort of service, if people staying there are just going to get drunk & high? It's just my opinion. On the bright side, I enjoyed the hop-on, hop-off canal cruises, the Anne Frank House, the Rjkmuseum, the Rembrant House, the Van Gogh museum, and a tour outside of the city. However, there's got to be better accommodations for the price. I would stay away from the Frisco Inn, unless you get a really good deal, and you are aware that it is just a bed & a private bath, & not much else.We selected this hotel because we had an early morning flight on RyanAir. When we arrived, exited the airport and proceeded to the WHITE Taxies. If we would have known that we could have taken a BUS in the direction to the Anagnina Metro (line A) for only 1euro each to the hotel, which is literally about a 2 min bus ride, we would have opted for that, however we were never told about this option until we got to the hotel. You just ask for the bus to the metro station and show the bus driver the address to the hotel and ask him to let you know when its there and to stop. Since we didn’t know, we had to take a taxi. This is where the problems started. We entered a WHITE Taxi. As the driver pulled away we asked how much. BIG MISTAKE. #1 always ask price before getting in taxi #2 ask the driver if he/she will give you a receipt. If they wont give you a receipt, chances are they are pocketing the EXTRA euros they try to swindle out of you. Ok so back to our little adventure. So the driver said, you speak English, we said yes. He pulled out a map showing the center of ROME and said it will be 30 euro. I said NO WAY, we are going 2 min away to the hotel and there is NO WAY we will pay 30 Euros and to stop the car and let us out. He would Not. Then he started to argue and then said ok, ok, ok 25 euros. I then said I will not pay more then 15 euros and demanded him to stop. He would not. well since the hotel is so close to the airport we were there before our argument ended. He then said he deserves 30euros because he lifted our one bag into his trunk of the car. I said I am only paying 15 euros. I handed him a 20 euros, he took it and was going to leave and I said, please give me my 5 euros now, and he said he did not have any. and then I demanded and he pulled out a hand full of coins adding up to about 4 euros and said that is all he had. I took it and then entered the hotel to report the cab number 2024. The hotel tried to call someone to report the driver but could not get anyone. Anyways long story short about a taxi drivers there, they are swindlers and try to milk you dry if you do not know, but hey this might be else ware but I don’t know. Now, for the Hotel. We entered the door through the BAR, since there was no posting we could see for the front door. The staff was nice at the front desk, and sympathetic to our bad experience with the WHITE Taxi. We were given a room in the 600's, BAD MISTAKE. It took us 5 min. to walk to the room. At first as we were walking down the 100s the hallways were air-conditioned and looked as if it was just remodeled and we were please with the look. As we were walking down the hall we said, “wow, very nice.” Ok well here is the kicker, after you exit the 100's and proceed to the rest of the MOTEL its OLD all the other hallways look like an old MENTAL HOSPITAL, with the drab looking walls, very little light and very hot. The floor is made from turquoise/blue tile. When we got to the room it smelled so bad from people smoking in the room, so we immediately closed the door. I asked my friend to wait outside the room with our bag and then I hiked back to the front desk to ask for another room. The staff accommodated us and put us in room 210. As we entered the room, there were 4 single beds in what looked as if it was directly out of a “youth hostel”. Very plain, no art on the drab-yellow walls that had some stain marks. The $9 lamp was from Ikea. The TV was super small and looked as it was from the 90s. The shower was a bit small, and the water seemed as if someone dropped an Alka-Seltzer tablet (you know one of the plop plop phiz phiz oh what a relief it is tablets) in the water or something, and tasted like it had some kind of minerals in it. It felt as if we were taking a shower in a carbonated water, shower fizzing all over us. Brushing our teeth felt equally strange, as this Alka-Seltzer water was making our mouth foam even more, and the taste was awful. No this was not SOFT WATER, it was something else, maybe someone reading this can let us know what it was, since at our other hotel outside of Venice had normal water. No free internet access in the room, however I think in the lobby there were 4 computer that could be used. There was a free continental breakfast, however it started at 7am and well most of the morning flights are at or before 7am so we are not able review that lavish display. Now, when we tried to check out in the morning, the computer system was not working or something (so the guy at the counter said – hmm looked to me the computer was working fine he just did not know how to use it I think). It seemed as if this was the counter guys first day/night on the job. He didn’t know were anything was and spent 20 min. trying to figure it out. Eventually I said “just make a copy of my receipt, showing I paid” and then he let us go to the airport so we not miss our flight. We opted to take the hotel shuttle, that starts at 5am in the morning, for 8-euros provided by the hotel, which we found out this was another option to get to the train station or Airport. All and all, just remember its best to use the public transportation, the bus that goes to the ANAGNINA METRO(Line A) is the best transport to and from the hotel. This is the metro that will take you into the city. Get a day pass from the machine for the Metro to see the sights. I would stay again at the hotel if we had a morning flight, because of how close it is to the airport, but would demand a room in the 100s, for the many reasons mentioned above and also because the barking of the guard dogs that are trained outside the hotel is a bit annoying at night. Once again the plus side to the stay was the friendly staff when we first arrived and the location of how close it is to the airport, in fact you can see the RyanAir jet outside the window if you look hard enough. In America this would be no more then a 2 star. So if your looking for anything better then an motel 6/8, this is not the place for you. If you’re just going to use it as a place to sleep for the night to get an early flight, with very little to no amenities, Alka-Seltzer water for the shower, drab, hot, mental hospital interior, then this is the place for you. ENJOY. PS one tip if your going to see the Coliseum, you will be HOUNDED when you exit the metro to go on a special tour, where you don’t have to wait in the 1 hour + in line to get tickets. Well here is the KEY to not waiting in line for tickets to the Coliseum that they wont tell you because they just want your euros. If you are facing the entrance to the Coliseum, turn around and you will see the ruins, and then you will see a path up to the ruins. Go up the hill where you will find the entrance for the ruins are and you will see a ticket booth left hand side. This ticket gets you in both, it’s the same price and you wont have to wait in line, like everyone else is at the Coliseum. When you go back to the Coliseum entrance make sure you are in the LEFT line, because the Right line is for those that need to purchase tickets.I had a guest visiting Chicago for the 1st time so I recommended the Hotel. The check-in was no problem friendly older man checked us in, room was nice & clean. Gave his CC checked in for 2 nights & was told a receipt would be given upon checkout. He stayed @ the Hotel the 1st night. The following night we stayed out late so he stayed @ my place. He never returned the following morning to return the key and he didn't get any phone calls from the Hotel, so he assumed they would automaticaly charge him for an extra night. When he returned to the hotel that night he wanted to check in with the front desk before he headed up to the room. When he explained everything to the person @ the front desk. The guy was extremly rude and kept cutting him off. Basically he told him that he was going to be charged for the 2 nights and $15 for a new key since he didn't hand it over @ checkout time. When my friend said he was returning the key & would like to check in again, he was told in a terrible tone of voice that, his room was already taken by another guest & that there was no vacancy there for him that he had to go some where else. My friend said he was very upset but didn't want to start any trouble although it seemed that that is what the front desk clerk was trying to start up with him. So he asked if he could get his receipt @ which the F.Desk person (a guy with a strong accent) replied, with even worst temper and physical movement, by basically backing him out of the door telling him he wasn't going to speak to him anymore & he wasn't getting anything from him if he wanted he could call the next day and put in a complaint and finally slammed the door in his face. I wanted to check on my friend to make sure everything went well at the Hotel so I called him an hour afterwards. He told me what had happened and I was truly horrified. He said he didn't want to tell me about it because he didn't want me to feel bad that he had had such a bad experiance happen to him here in Chicago while he was visiting for the first time. He didn't have anywhere to go so he figured he would drive around until the following morning. I immediatly called the Hotel. Now with out exagerating the phone must have rang more that 20 times before it was picked up but I wasn't going to hang up. I was very upset and couldn't believe what had happened. The guy didn't even say the name of the Hotel so I had to ask if this was the Hotel. So I said I had a couple of questions for him in a very pleasant voice. 1st I asked is there any vacancy. @ which he replied yes there are a "FEW ROOMS" available! So I said okay well now I want to ask you another question. @ which he cut me off by saying "why do you have another question I said there are rooms available". I told him that I heard him the 1st time but it would be nice if he didn't cut me off because it was rude and I still wanted to ask him some other stuff. So I went on to tell him everything my friend told me happened and the whole time he kept cutting me off and tried rasing his voice but then I raised mine and said I wasnt my friend & I wasn't going to let him treat me the way he treated him to which he started saying it was a mistake that he misundurstood, that he never said there was no vacancy basically everything the opposite of what my firend had told me. He finally said to send him back that there was only one room available but he would hold it for 1/2 an hr until he got there(even thought he had told me there were a few when I called but again he said I misunderstood, when I brought it up) . I called my friend, insisted he come over and stay @ my place but he felt bad about everything already so he preffered to go back to the Hotel. Once he arrived the guy apologized and tried to convince him that some how there had been a missunderstanding on my friends side. He even added that he had already spoken to the person that would be there in the morning for check out and that he had explained what had happened and that a discount would be offered to him as an apology. The best part yet came when my friend finally came to the checkout and the same guy was downstairs and basically said there is no discount, call if you want to put a complaint and kicked him out all over again. I didn't find out about this until 2 days after he had left so I went to the Hotel and set a complaint to the person @ the front desk who claimed they were an assistant manager. They heard everything with detail and they apologized and said they would leave a note with my name & # so that the person that runs the place supervisor/Manager could call me back. They promised something would def. be done about it. They also told me while I was there that the room my friend was staying @ didn't have a second lock so the guy shouldn't have checked the room out to someone else while my friend still had another key. They also said they wouldn't put the reason why my name & number was being placed on the board for the Supervisor/Manager to see because if "others" working there found out it was a complaint it might dissaper??? Are they serious!! Aparrently it has happened that someone has complained and yet the complaint filled has just dissapered. I got a phone call 2 days later from someone claiming they where calling to investigate a complaint. They said they were calling from the Hotel, the voice sounded very familiar so I asked who was I speeking to @ which they replied "I'm calling form Heart O Chicago". I said I know but who am I speaking to what is your name! The guy finally said it was him who I was complaining about and he wanted to know why I was doing it, basically getting all defensive. I told him I wasn't going to speak to him, that I was told someone specificaly would call me from management and I had nothing to explain to him so I hung up. 3 weeks later nothing from no one..... I guess my # and name misteriously dissapered from the Management board. I stopped in last night to ask about what was going on and the person @ the front desk said he didn't know anything and didn't want to get involved he just gave me a card with the Hotels # on it. Aparently there is no way of contacting anyone else like managment thru email or phone. Just by leaving a stupid note on the board that will end up in the garbage before they decide to stop by to see if things are going well. I promise you though if they think this is over they are very wrong.A con was the slow bar service.Somewhat disappointing wine list (only new vintages.Booking a room at the Griffin House Hotel from my home in Australia, I imagined from the description a small cosy B&B, with some cute but nice rooms, a filling breakfast and free wireless internet. After all, for 70 quid a night, it would be quite reasonable to expect ‘nice’. You don’t get ‘great’ or even ‘good’ in London for less than 120 a night. I’ve stayed in many hotels over the years. Some cost a lot less than the Griffin House and were virtually five-star apartments (The Salisbury Hotel on 57th Street in New York is amazing), others cost a lot less and were hideous (The Globe Hotel, Oswiecim, Poland begs some politically incorrect comparisons with the former death camp across the railway line). But the Griffin House Hotel takes the Golden Turd in the All-Time Overpriced Dump category. When I checked into the Griffin House and was struck by the profound sourness of the staff. Since I decided to give up living in Britain during the Thatcher tyranny, a kind of officious and humourless pseudo-customer-service has emerged, where you the customer are told you’re very important yet treated as an undeserving cretin with the audacity to be giving them money. But the Griffin House staff have entered a new Superleague of crapulence in the arena of customer f***-you-ness. I paid for my two nights on arrival and was given the key to my room “down the stairs and next to the Breakfast Room”. In the basement? Yes, in the basement. The room was so small that the bedside tables were across from the creeky double bed, since there was virtually no room either side. The walls were stained by a tide-mark of damp rising from the floor. The shower was in a cupboard. Yes, a cupboard shower. Its nozzle bracket hung loosely from the wall, and when I took a shower the floor quickly with filled with water around my ankles. The toilet cupboard was fitted with a motion-detector air freshener, that spat Glade at me every time I entered the room, and if I dared move while sitting on the seat. Don’t take too long having a dump – you’ll come out smelling like a disinfectant cake. The signal for the free wireless internet was unserviceably weak. I complained, nicely, and was told I could get a better signal in the Breakfast Room next door. But I was then questioned by other staff about what I was doing loitering there. “What room are you from?! What room are you from?!!!” The view from my window was the window of the kitchen, six inches away, which lit up 6:30am every morning and emanated with the clanging of pots. The first morning I just wanted the hell out of the Hotel, so I avoided the free breakfast in the Breakfast Room and ate at the Pret a Manger near Marble Arch. The second morning, however, I thought, hey, what the hell, it’s paid for, I might as well get something for my 70 quid a night. And, I have to say, this decision it worth every single penny. I was treated to a new and unaired episode of Falty Towers. It was truly hilarious. I took a seat at one of the three four-seater tables (a curious choice of seating, giving that the hotel’s rooms are either singles or doubles). The cook/waitress/entertainment came out of the kitchen to take my order. I had Option 1 or Option 2, the basic difference being eggs or cereal, and the choice of tea, coffee or hot chocolate. Could I order a black coffee? The milk is on your table, of course, the coffee comes out black. And how dare I ask such a ridiculous question. Since the coffee I ordered never showed up, they could have got away with spoiling me so much for choice anyway. I was distracted from my scrambled eggs by a French woman and her two daughters entering the Breakfast Room at 9:40am. The cook/waitress ordered “Sit! Sit...! Come on...! SIT! We stop serving at 10am...! Sit or you won’t get anything!” The party of three was coerced to sit across two different tables, the kids looking quite distressed and intimidated. Their order was taken with the same minus-scale level of respect I had experienced. Then the cook/waitress brought out three glasses of orange juice and slammed them down in front of each diner as though she was closing an auction. I was expecting next a large pot of gruel and Mr Bumble shouting “MORE?!” It would have been hilarious had the kids not have been trembling. I can just imagine what they would say when they get back to Lille or Paris or Lyon and tell their friends and family about the “tres merde” time they’d had in London. Since I’ve stayed at the Salisbury Hotel in New York, I’ve told so many people about it, and I know friends have told their friends, and so that place’s reputation will only grow and it will get more clients. The staff at the Griffin House just do not get this. I mean, who cares if you’ve had a crap time in their dumpy hotel, when there’s still plenty of suckers out there, like I was, who read the misleading description of the hotel, think they might be getting 70 quid of hotel value and are duped into booking. Just after I checked out, I went for a pint at the pub on the corner, the Duke of Kendal. The barmaid asked where I’d been staying and we had a conversation about what a thoroughly crap time I’d had at the Griffin. “Oh! I won’t recommend anyone stays there then...!” she said. And that too is why I’m writing this review. Just generally, if you get a bad vibe about a place when you arrive, ask to see the room *before* you pay anything. But more specifically, please save yourself the feeling of being ripped-off, abused and imprisoned in a basement and avoid the Griffin House Hotel. In short, I have three things to say about the Griffin House: 1. Do not stay at this hotel. 2. Do not stay at this hotel. 3. And do NOT stay at this hotel.Frankly, the chinese food here is something I can make better at home.The service was pretty poor all around, the food was well below average relative to the cost, and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place.However, being foodies, we were utterly disappointed with the food.Well, in my 20 some years of business travel, the stay in downtown Chicago's W Hotel (Adams Street) has to be one of my worst experience! I booked their so called "Sneakaway for a Summer Sleepover at W Hotel" offer at $309 a night for 3 nights (July 13-16). I know that the room will be a bit small (they said ~230 sq ft) but the description said that it includes Breakfast, in-room Movie, wine-cooler sorbet and free access to the health club etc. etc. Although I had booked the Westin River North at $275 a night for a room twice the size (AAA rate), I decided to switch to the W Hotel because (1) their website shows really nice rooms and I thought it would be nice to try a W Hotel which I had never tried before, and (2) the package includes breakfast, which at Starwoods hotels usually would be about $25-30 anyways. Well that turned out to be a hotel from hell for me: 1) The room (#731) is barely a 200 sq ft, and the bathroom is so small that I have to turn sideways in order to access the toilet (and I am a small person). When I sit down, the toilet paper is right in my face (right side) and my left knee is touching the shower curtain. The carpet is dirty, and there are no drawers for cloths except for 3 small drawers in the night table by the bed. 2) When I checked in I was given some coupons for breakfast, drinks and so on. When I took a closer look, I discovered that the "breakfast coupon" is only for "in room dining/breakfast" (there was no mention of that in their website). Also I only got 2 coupons when I was staying for 3 nights. So the next day I went to see the front desk and asked for a third coupon. The staff (and then the manager) told me that I should not have gotten the second coupon in the first place: the package is ONLY for ONE breakfast for the entire stay. I said: if the package says "free hotel parking" does it mean that it is only for 1 night? or free access to the health club is it only for one night? After much exchange he finally gave me a third coupon. At the time I did not have access to look at what the website said and so I thought it merely says "breakfast" - still "breakfast" would mean daily breakfast. If they do mean ONE breakfast for the entire stay they should be up-front and mention that. After I got home I checked into their ad again and viola! it said explicitly "daily breakfast" http://www.welcometowhotels.com/sleepawaycamp/?IM=SOP_top_WH_WCAMP 3)To add insult to injury: the coupon is for "breakfast for 2 people" up to a maximum of $20 - for in-room dining. Their smallest coffee size is a carafe which is $10, pastry is $5, delivery charge $3.75 and service charge $3.56 for a grand total of $24.83. The pastry turned out to be ONE danish. So I wonder how can they even say that it is breakfast for 2 people for $20 - unless they expect 2 people to share one danish pastry. Even though I stayed there by myself, I still had to pay the extra $4.83, the amount over the $20 allowance. How can a hotel advertise "daily breakfast included" when one still has to pay???? 4) When I couldn't access their wireless internet in my room I called their help desk: first they transferred me to the IT help line which put me on hold for 10 mins so I hanged up. Called the help desk again, and they said they would send someone to my room to help me. Well it turned out that this was a hotel maintenance guy who knows nothing about computer. He said he was there to make sure that I had my PC plugged in correctly!! Finally I got through to their help line, and the person who answered told me that their wireless network does not support Linus platform. he could not send someone to my room or work on my PC because he is not in the hotel - that the support is outsourced! So I said fine and stopped using the PC at the hotel. On the day before I cheked out I ran into a fellow in the elevator typing away on his notebook computer. I commented to him that I could not log onto the network. he said that's odd, becasue he IS the IT manager at the hotel and he could check that right away for me. Well I was on my way out to dinner, on the last day, so what good is it for me to use my PC when I only have one more night to stay there??? 5) Staff attitude: well the help line staff and the doormen were very nice and courteous. But some staff at the concierge and the reception desk are not. One case in point: the final bill incuded an item "mini- pak" of ~$34 which I never used. When I checked out I said I had not charged anything called a mini-pak and it souned like some snack in the room bar. I said that if I had used it I would have remembered. The staff replied "well, even a bottle of our water is $10 so $34 is not that much". I held my tongue instead of saying "if a person is silly enough to spend $10 on bottled water, he/she should be reborn in their next life in a third world country!". When I asked a concierge how far is the restaurant that I wanted to try, and whether it is "within walking distance", he said "everything is within walking distance". A more courteous staff would say "it is about xxx minutes walking", or "it may be bettr to take a cab because it may take you about 45 minutes to walk there" Normally I do not like posting negative messages on travel sites. A good customer should always talk to the establishment first and give them the chance to correct their mistakes. In this case I have talked to their manager. Their "survey" is going back to their downtown hotel, rather than to W Hotel headquarter so I believe the so-called survey is useless. If anyone knows how can I get this message to W Hotel - higher up than the managers who hang out at the reception desk, please let me know.Majestic 5 star nightmare J  B Thompson - Booking ref: 0312/39816Told [--] and majestic about this and heard nothing. Gave them 1 week to respond but didnt so here is the review.Other hotels PR feel free to spread the word.Flight delayed by 2 hours going over but it was ok as you expect things like this. We paid an extra 拢130 each (拢260 total) to go premium so we wouldnt have to stand in queues which we didnt going over but coming back to UK we were stood in massive queue for over 1 hour in sweltering dom rep heat. NOT WORTH THE MONEY ! Screaming baby in premium cabin before takeoff and most of the flight, same child coming back screaming again. People had paid premium to get sleep. Most people had to be up for work next day. Shouldnt allow babies in premium cabin !!!!Got to hotel and 1st day wife discovered outside loo's were covered in excrement all the way down the path and all over the toilet pretty much everywhere but in it. ok we thought...not hotels fault, this was obviously someone caught very short probably a child or something. 2nd day noticed that the meat chef was handling cooked chicken with the same tongs as he was handling raw chicken so reported salmonella risk to manager and they then fired wrong person. Spent most of 3rd day getting poor guy his job back  asking them not to fire the actual person responsible but simply retrain them in basic food hygiene or move them to a pasta bar. Met numerous people who had spent approx 1 third of their holiday on the loo with severe diarohhea or in full time in bed with suspected food poisoning. Starting to get worried now. Wife tried to book anniversary surprise through a hotel staff girl called MADELEINE who was pregnant and about to leave soon. Next day i realised why my wife was so upset... Blase Madeleine who troubled me from the moment i met her upon noticing she was the exact double for the actress from ugly betty without the braces hadnt bothered with the room decor arrangement infact we didnt even get an anniversary banner on our door until the last couple of days which we had to keep asking for. Said that they dont do that, but have read that they did. Caught out as a liar as we got a banner eventually (2 days before leaving) Rubbish Lobby bar man called MAXIMO who will completely ignore you despite waiting ages for a drink. A swim up bar where everyone appears to just pee in the water and never leave their stools (no pun intended) for fear of losing their place or the evidentally too long 1 minute walk to the loo's. Hotel needs to get urine reactor dye in pool to discourage this. 1 week into our 2 week holiday and our very 1st anniversary is RUINED !, thought it couldnt get any worse until next day the sliding balcony door fell in on us and smashed which could have killed one of us especially if a child was there. Saw manager and insisted on being treated like royalty for our last week as the hotel had ruined our 1st anniversary together. They tried to flog us off with a free dinner on the beach which we should have had anyway, insisted on a better room which was a start but then after that no more gestures to make our holiday feel remotely special. .Our final and third room was 3407 after 2 inconvenient moves.Every morning my wife and I like to have a coffee before we left the apartment but quite often if the maid had even bothered to replace the powdered milk, it was hard and didnt even melt when put into the hot coffee, so went out as usual to try and find a maid when i heard screaming and shouting on the ground floor. Approximately 5 maids and 3 other hotel staff were holding up one of the cleaners to the sky in what looked like some kind of bizarre voodoo ritual... she said that she has passed out with the heat but she was acting all weird with her eyes rolling around in her head like they do on the TV documentaries when theyre pretending to be possessed. They were then doing the heimlich manouvre on her which kind of summed up their first aid knowledge. It was making me cringe and very angry at the same time however my weird  dark sense of humour at this point could not resist shouting down for some more milk. Hotel management came about 10 minutes later and took her away. She was back to work within minutes. I kind of get the impression the hotel don't mess with the maids from superstitious fear of their ridiculous voodoo claims and haiti origins. If you read this review  still go then you deserve everything that happens to you. It really makes no odds to us. We wanted to do a good thing as we do every year and put some money into a 3rd world country but their idea of 5 star and your idea of 5 star will be greatly different i assure you.If you like waiting ages for your meal  drinks  then have the orders all messed up when they DO finally arrive, this is the hotel for you. I feel i have a civil duty to warn people about the potential death threat looming over this establishment and now thomson are aware of it so when it DOES happen, the victim/s will at least have some legal comaback. This is a shame because there were a lot of really nice staff. The animation/entertainment team were brilliant and the other (not the swim up bar) pool was lovely and warm. The seona trip was expensive but enjoyed doing it, but half of the holiday and the premium upgrade was not. We are now seeking full refund on the premium upgrade and half of the cost for the 2 weeks there. Met a couple who were accused of not paying for a bottle of wine  were embarrassed in front of an entire restaurant, fortunately they had kept the receipt. Also met a couple who had cockroaches in their room and it took the hotel 1 week to move them to a different room which was eventually an adjoining room to a screaming baby, so basically they just swapped the complaining occupants over. I spent most of my time for entertainments sake sat at the bottom of the pool with an empty plastic cup waving to the scuba divers and freaking them out. Really wish our 1st anniversary was spent elsewhere.Dead drowned body of a woman washed up on the beach in broad daylight which upset everyone on the beach including one of our friends who went down to beach to get one last look at it before leaving. I Told management that it would probably be a good idea to have someone patrolling the beach in the early hours as there would probably be more floating across from the cuban hurricane but they didnt. Overall conclusion...WONT be going back EVER and wont ever use THOMSON again either! We really regret not going back to the excellence in cancun mexico which really was a 5 star experience. It was perfect. I have never ever written a review before as have always had good holidays. The Majestic Colonial put an end to all that. Visit it at your own peril ! TOTAL waste of money !A BigShinyNoisy Keurig OfficePRO BRICK!.March 2012 - In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and started searching for a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the "K-Cup" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines, and the on-line Reviews for this model were all 4-Star or better. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' unit ... for offices and heavy-duty use.<br /><br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along-side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances, and took off.<br />When I returned back this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Right now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />Comparison of the Keurig OfficePRO versus the Tassimo Bosch:<br /><br />* Start-up Time: Tassimo Win's, as it starts to Brew immediately after you turn it on! Keurig has a 'Warm-Up Phase, until an Indicator light's up, to let you know that it's ready to brew.<br /><br />* Brewing Time: Tassimo Win's, as it's a bit Faster, regardless of the Size of the T-disc, and because you literally have no "start-up" time.<br />So Logically, this will play a factor in the Brewing Time, as well. In fairness, we are talking about a 2 to 3-minute gap, that this could be interpreted as being a bit too Subjective, but, that's how I roll ...<br /><br />* Brew Strength: Tassimo Win's again! I tested a Medium StarBuck's T-disc Grind, versus a Medium StarBuck's K-Cup. The Keurig's strength was more like MILD, than Medium.<br /><br />* Unit Noise: Tassimo is significantly quieter than the Keurig unit, by a factor of at least 3!<br /><br />* Water Capacity: Tassimo has 67-ounce removable water tank (without water filter) and accepts MAVEA water filters;<br />The Keurig B145 Water reservoir holds up to 48-ounces. Tassimo Win's!<br /><br />About the UIF (User Interface) and other features, worth mentioning:<br /><br />* Tassimo - On the Front Faceplate, it has 1 Large 'Chrome Button Wheel', that handles all Functions + an On/Off switch.

I agree that staff are pleasant enough, but they don't have a handle on what they are doing. We booked two twin rooms last minute, so we (or rather our company) paid through the nose. Â£260 for the four of us. If we'd paid Â£40 I might be less scathing about it, but still wouldn't be giving a good review. Sadly it was London Fashion Week when we had need to be in London, so our options were limited. The car park looks like something left over from the Cold War and the front of the building could be a prison with the barbed wire, high fences and concrete walls. Despite being fully booked, we managed to park easily although they charge you Â£5 per vehicle for 24hrs which seems somewhat outrageous! There is a cafe/bar here, and the stench of stale cooking oil and grease that emanates from it out into the carpark is appalling. Empty beer kegs were stacked up by the wall. On entering, my heart lifted slightly as the entrance was clean and tidy. The bar is reasonably stocked with alcoholic drinks of your choice and there is a wall with a number of vending machines - one for water, one for cans of fizzy pop and two more for snacks and the essentials that you may forget like a toothbrush or toothpaste. Check in was straight forward albeit that the two rooms which were on the same booking were inexplicably split so that one was on the first floor and the other on the fourth. In to the lift (clean enough on first inspection but the floor is actually in serious need of a scrub on hands and knees - not a swab with a mop) and up we went. The door popped open on the first floor to let some people out and the stench of stale, rotting carpet and furniture was atrocious. It smelt to me like there was a hot water leak somewhere (although that may actually have been because the whole place was overheated) which had permeated the carpets throughout the hallways and was now rotting the fixtures and fittings from the inside out. It was appalling. We carried on up to the fourth floor where the door opened to a normal clean-smelling hallway. Phew. The room was typically Travelodge basic, which was perfectly normal and acceptable. The bathroom was reasonably clean, but there was water damage across the ceiling from a recent looking leak. A clean single duvet on each bed and a solitary pillow about as thick as the palm of your hand. A card in the room said to ask at reception if you wanted another pillow. Other than that, it was generally fine. The temperature, however, was awful. The heating was off, but it was so stuffy that it was not bearable. The window only cracks open about two inches - no doubt to stop you throwing yourself out of it - so a breath of fresh air was impossible. The hotel is of course right on the Northern Circular, which essentially means a motorway passing about 20 yards from the windows. We knew about this and had brought earplugs in preparation, but you couldn't leave the window open to sleep. We left the window open as wide as we could (hardly at all!) and went out for the evening. On our return, I asked at reception for a round of four pillows (one each) but was told that the hotel was fully booked so they had none left. I don't really care whether or not they are fully booked - they should have sufficient bedding for each room. I then tried to get a bottle of water from the vending machine - completely empty. The bar do not sell soft drinks except as mixers. My only option for a soft drink was to pay Â£1 for a can of diet coke from another machine, which was lukewarm. My colleague then asked to buy a toothbrush as she'd forgotten hers and was directed to another machine. It was also empty. On asking again at reception, she was met with shrugs. On asking who was responsible for filling the machines, they shrugged again. A staff member then retrieved a packet of peanut M&M's and gave them to her by way of apology for being out of pillows, water and toothbrushes. It was a nice gesture, I'm sure, but I cannot see how it remotely related to the issues we had at that point! On going to the first floor in the morning to collect our colleagues on the way out, I was appalled to see the volume of wanton damage that has not been repaired and lack of care and attention by the hotel management. There were a number of fires that had been set at some point, up against doors and walls, damaging both the doors and the carpets. There were horrific looking stains on the carpets that could have been either vomit or faeces, judging by the colours. The carpets were lifting up and are filthy - I suspect that the water damage you can smell is linked to the carpets moving around like hair in a Timotei advert. The Ace Cafe (of motorbike fame) is a few minutes walk away and well worth a visit in my opinion! Stonebridge Park tube and railway station is about fifteen minutes on foot from the hotel and the Bakerloo Line will take you straight into the city centre in 29 minutes. I will be writing to the hotel management to complain, and more or less C&P'ing my review in the letter. The brand has a reasonably good reputation for good, basic, clean, standardised facilities. I've stayed in Â£6/night B&B's in Sri Lanka with considerably better quality, fewer stinks and better service. This hotel is a disgrace to the chain.I dont normally write reviews--neither when the service is great nor when it is aweful, despite the fact I travel over 50% of the time with my job. I do read Trip Advisor with regularity though, and often follow the advice i find there. Nonetheless, I cannot help but plead with the reader not to reward this type of establishment with your business. First of all, I was headed to Vegas for a trip I make every year for the opening rounds of the NCAA tournament. Everything I had heard (and I am sure you have too), is that the biggest and and best of Vegas was the Wynn/Encore. I booked on Hotwire for 145 night and couldnt have been more excited. Everything was great until we set foot inside. The Service We arrived early and were told that our room wasnt available. Hey, I understood that, it was a high turnover day and they needed some time to get a room clean. Not the best of starts but certainly nothing to complain over. They put my name on a list and assured me then would call my cell when the first room was clean. After watching literally probably a hundred people check out, I inquired again. It was the type of service we would come to know at the Wynn--too busy to help or be bothered. They again sent me away. Rather than leave, we decided to head to the SportsBook, the reason we had come to Vegas in the first place. There, we were told that all the seats in the Sportsbook itself were reserved, and that only seats in an adjacent bar area were available. This was a little disappointing, but again, nothing that bad. So we sat at the adjacent bar area. Now there was literally NO ONE in the Sportsbook yet, but we couldnt sit in any of the seats. We also came to find out that you couldnt get a complimentary drink in the Sportsbook unless you made a $300 bet--and then only one drink coupon!! I do this trip every year and have never ever heard of such a thing!! When I told my other friends also staying at the property about it, they didnt even believe me until they arrived and found the same thing, only when they arrived they couldnt even sit at the adjacent bar area because all those seats had now been reserved!! In case you are curious about how much drinks costs, try about 6 bucks for a beer and about 13 for a mixed drink. We didn't stay long--we went down to the Venetian (where we stayed last year) and they greeted us with open arms. We tried the pool at Wynn, but there were no seats available. We could see from our room that the pool at the Encore had space, but were told that we werent allowed over there, even though the phone representative said we would have access to both properties. Upon checking out, they told us we had over $100 in mini bar charges, even though we hadn't touched a thing. A manager had to come inspect the bar and he told us that its all "weighted" and that if you bump into it, it automatically charges you. He even said that most people don't even check out and don't even realize it until they get home and it is always a big hassle for them (the biggest and best resort in Vegas nickel and diming you--what a joke!) The Rooms. If you look online, you will think a relatively large and rather plush room awaits your arrival. I am going to be honest. I used the word Hampton Inn to describe the rooms to at least 5 other guests and all agreed. That was about the size and quality of the rooms. I will say the bathrooms were oversized and had a separate shower and bath, but that was about it. I didn't even see how the online depictions were even close to what we got when we arrived. We did have an amazing view of the golf course and pool areas, but that was it. Some final thoughts. I understand that they Wynn drops their rack rate to get rid of excess rooms on Howire, so it is very tempting to book there. You think 5 star resort for so cheap, so why not. I am trying to remember everything else bad that happened as I write this, but nothing else is coming to mind. I just cannot say enought bad things about this place. There is no way they will fix it if people continue to come, so I would plead with other readers not to reward this type of service with your business. I had read on Trip Advisor of other readers who stayed here and had similar experiences, but until you experience just how bad it is, you cannot fathom how indeed poor it is. Oh yeah I just thought of another thing. When the Sportsbook opened for betting on one of the busiest betting days of the year, there was only 1 person taking bets--there were more than 10 windows, but only 1 person taking bets. The line was over 200 people deep and STILL they didnt bother to add additional staff. What kind of preparation was that? I will tell you, the type that simply doesnt care. They have enough business, that they dont need the little guys, which I will admittedly say that I am. I dont make huge bets, but I do gamble, just not enough for Mr. Wynn to take notice. Another thing I remembered. I had forgotten my Blackberry charger. Now admittedly I have dont this a million time when traveling, but because the cast number of chargers that are left at hotels, they ALWAYS have a few extra. At the Wynn, however, acquiring one was not so easy. In fact, despite the fact that they said they indeed did have one, they refused to offer it to me because the Concierge desk had not opened yet! When the Concierge desk did open, I was told that they could not let me use a charger that someone had left because they donate them all to CHARITY?!?!?!? I guess the charities in Vegas are in dire need on Blackberry chargers these days. The ones in Houston need food, in Vegas they need Blackberry chargers (at least according to Mr. Wynn). I almost forgot one of the mosty disgusting things, but I called a fellow guest to make sure I didnt leave anything out here. One day, after what the Wynn refers to as Housekeeping cleaned our room, we came back to shower for the evening. There was something that closesly resembled feces and/or mildew on the towels they left hanging on the rack. This was not only on one towel, but on both of the towels they had left hanging for us. THe made who replaced them was like "Oh yeah, that happens all the time, here are some new ones" If it happens all the time then why are you looking for whatever it is and ensuring that your guests arent having to find it for themselves. I kid you not, at first I thought it was some kind of a joke. It was so disgusting. Despite all these issues, we never received a single call from anyone attempting to apologize for anything. So again, I implore you to invoke the most powerful weapon in the traveler's arsenal, the abillity to simply book another hotel. In this economy especially, one would think customer service in a customer based business would be paramount--this is simply not the case at the Wynn/Encore Las Vegas.We are a quite surprised by the reviews on here rating KBC so highly. We purchased an entire week stay with KBC a year ahead of time through Diamond Resort Properties, and we used it for our honeymoon after our wedding. We purchased what was called a "sampler package" through a timeshare presentation we attended through another hotel a year before. We were told when we purchased the 7 day package with KBC and Diamond that we would never have to attend another timeshare presentation again. We could go there on our honeymoon and enjoy ourselves. The week before our wedding, we received a phone call from KBC confirming our arrival and advising us that we must attend a timeshare presentation while there on our honeymoon or else we would be non-compliant and would be charged $3000 on our credit card!! We were shocked and advised them we had already attended a presentation prior. They didn't even want to listen to us. We arrived within a few days after that phone call. The valet was very nice and the lobby was pretty. As we were checking in, the lady at the front desk advised us again that we had to appear and warned us not to be late for the presentation or else they would charge our card. We told her we wanted to speak to someone about the situation, but she kept insisting there was nothing they could do. Apparently, KBC likes to blame Diamond Resort Properties for any miscommunication, and vice versa...they just like blaming each other. We were told we would be given an ocean view room because we had actually purchased through Diamond on a presentation a year before, and therefore, we would be entitled to an ocean view room and be given a bucket of champagne upon arrival and be treated like honeymooners. To our horror, we got to our room and I opened back the curtains and saw multiple dumpsters and construction trailers in what appeared to be an old park. We even saw a homeless person urinating in the park. Then, our shower had the showerhead faucet coming directly out of the ceiling. There was a large hole and it looked like it was going to fall down any minute. You could move it from side to side and there were cobwebs up in the hole. In addition, there was a dirty razor blade on the shower floor where the housekeeping obviously missed and the shower was very moldy and our entire room smelled musty and old. The bed was so uncomfortable you could feel the springs digging into your back. We walked back down to the front desk to express our concern. The lady said that if Diamond promised us an ocean view room that there was nothing they could do about it and we had to speak to them but they were not available. They had us booked in that room, and she said to us, "All of our rooms come with a scenic view even though they are not on the ocean." We laughed and showed her our camera with the photos of the dumpsters and I said, "Does this look like a scenic view to you?" She said, "Oh, well, there are mountains in the background you can see." We told her we are from Phoenix, AZ and we have mountains in our own backyard that have a prettier view than this. We were told that no other rooms were available and we had no choice but to stay in the one we were given. Later on that same night, I asked for a showercap because there were not any in the room. They never brought one so I walked back down yet again to get one. The front desk staff took 10 minutes to find a showercap and finally brought me a cardboard box with showercaps that had the words "Sheraton" marked out with a black marker...very odd! The TV in the room would not work correctly. If you turned it off, it kept coming back on entirely on its own. The WiFi access would not work and we called the front desk. They gave us a number to call for maintenance to get help. When we checked out, they actually billed us for making that call to maintenance!! Each morning at 5 am, we were awoke by the loud sound of housekeeping dragging the vaccum cleaners on the ceramic tile hallways outside the front door. People checking out early also wake you up with the suitcase wheels being walked by. Because the rooms open to an outdoor atrium and it is all raised tile it makes it extremely noisy. When we attended the time share presentation as we were told to do, we advised them of all the problems we had. It was at this time that Diamond Properties told us that our room was one of those that had not yet been converted from the old Embassy Suites to the new remodeled ones. Diamond Properties intervened and that same day they got us moved finally to our ocean view room that we were promised. They did not push us at the presentation after hearing our story and seeing the pictures on our camera. They really did try and rectifiy the situation. The spa at KBC is really awful, and caution if you make an appointment there. As honeymooners, we wanted to go and get a couples massage and we found out they do not even offer that. We went to get massages anyway and the spa is the size of a closet with a couple of rooms. The towels were dirty and you could hear everyone's coversation going on in the place as you were getting a massage. I had to use the restroom at the spa, and they directed me to a cleaning closet with a washer and dryer, a dirty mop bucket and dirty toilet bowl brushes on the floor and a tiny toilet in the corner. Later, we visited the Hyatt Spa down the road...a must spa to go see...absolutely gorgeous! As for the food at KBC, the outdoor patio restaurant was not very good quality. We ordered some nachos for an appetizer and the salsa tasted like it was out of a Pace Picante jar from the market across the street. As for the buffet breakfast each morning...beware of the birds that swoop down and eat your food right off your plate. I sat my plate down on our table and walked away to go get my drink and came back to my plate with 3 birds standing on it eating my scambled eggs. One good thing about KBC was the sunset and the cabana rental. It was a really gorgeous view of the sunset. The beach was nice, but very small and cut off right away. We went to go for a walk and it only lasted a few minutes before you have to turn around and walk back. We spent most of our time in the cabana we rented on the beach. It was very nice and the cabanas had nice views of the ocean and were very close to the beach. For a couple of days, the pool was closed off with yellow tape around it and no one would tell us why?? Looking back, I am glad we never found out what happened...probably better off not knowing. We purchased tickets for their luau that they advertise by calling it the "Feast By The Sea" but they actually hold it in the basement of the hotel in a dark and dirty conference room! We will never stay at KBC again, and I definitely do not reccommend this hotel / timeshare. My new husband and I have already agreed to re-do our honeymoon...this time it will be at the Hyatt down the street from KBC or 4 Seasons.The resort that we fled Our experience was so terrible that its difficult to know where to begin. Here's our story: my husband and I are both professionals in our early 30's. We are both experienced world travelers, staying in both the most humble hostels in Europe as well as 5 star resorts (ex: the Four Seasons) in Hawaii. We decided to take a trip at the last minute and used a travel agent (Apple Vacations) to do so. We asked for these elements: 5 star accomodations and we wanted to be somewhere in the Caribbean (maybe Jamaica). We explained that we wanted to spend time at the beach, by the pool, snorkeling and basically just being outside in the sun. Our travel agent told us that she didn't recommend Jamaica but HIGHLY recommended Punta Cana and specifically the Riu Palace. Said it was the best hotel on the island and was all inclusive. She even convinced us to pay for an upgrade to a junior suite with an ocean view.Upon arriving on the island and paying our $10 cover charge (something our travel agent failed to tell us about) we were taken to the Riu Palace. To reach the hotel, you must first pass by all of the lovely staff quarters. When you pull up, its as if there's something missing. The front is beautiful but a bit empty. Check-in was the 2nd best part of our stay (checking out was the best)...simple and easy. It was pouring rain because our travel agent didn't check the weather forecast so we couldn't really explore too much.Our junior suite wasn't very impressive. Actually it wasn't a suite, it was a standard room. Ocean view? No, the view was of a service road and a small strip of landscaping. The balcony would have been nice if it any privacy but it could be seen from about 12 other balconies. The shower was a dark, tiled cave. The shampoos and other complimentary toiletries looked like they had been used and recycled. The room also had a bizarre smell to it, kind of like a funky baby powder.The bed: I would have slept better on the tile floor with newspaper. The matress was rock hard and the sheets were of the poorest quality. One of the pillows was also torn and stained. Not exactly the 5 star accomodations we were told that we were getting.Since we were limited to being indoors, we first checked out the sports bar so we could get a snack and a drink. The drinks were watered down and terrible. The snacks that were available, as promised 24/7, were hot dogs and hamburgers and sandwiches from a refridgerated case. It was self serve and you had to heat them in a microwave yourself. A high school cafeteria has better food. There were also nachos with cheeze whiz...I've had better at a sports arena.We also went to the casino. Casino translates to about 15 slot machines.Now we were eagerly looking forward to dinner. We were forced to eat at the buffet (despite many open tables in the other restaurants) because you may only make a dinner reservation between 7:30a and 10:30a in person at that restaurant. No exceptions.The buffet was horrible. It was like a segmented pig trough. You ate at tables with stained linens and cracked china. I guess the chipped dinnerware is to match the many many cracks that run throughout the exterior of the building, causing you to wonder about its stability.Leaving the buffet hungry, we ordered room service (an extremely limited menu). Once it finally arrived, we were highly disappointed. A burger from the sports bar and some sort of sandwich like thing. It resembled the type of sandwich you might get from a vending machine in a bowling alley.Day 2 was even worse. We were awoken at 6am by the footsteps that echo throughout this entirely tiled building. They were coming from above our junior suite, the hall, and the rooms on either side of us.After dining at the breakfast buffet (slightly more edible than dinner), we located the Apple Vacation's rep in the hotel. She had us transferred to another room, hoping that it would help. This room smelled worse and the view this time was of the staff housing.Once we were moved there was a brief break in the downpour of rain. We went down to the pool. The towel shack was out of towels. How does a beach front hotel with a huge pool run out of fresh towels for its guests???It was at this point that we phoned our travel agent and were transferred to Iberostar. We FLED Rui Palace. This was more of an over-night camp for adults. A poorly run one at that. Actually, I would have slept and ate better at a summer camp!Basically, if you want a restful, relaxing, pampered vacation: DO NOT stay at the Riu Palace. Its great if you want to return home more stresed out than when you arrived.P.S. Did I mention the bugs that were coming from the decorative fresh flowers placed around the room? And don't forget to be harrassed by the street vendors that are allowed on the property.The Comfort Hotel is anything but comfortable. We have stayed there two previous times before with no problems, however this hotel chain has definitely gone downhill over the years. When we walked into our guest room after checking in, we were stuck to the floor ... literally. There were sticky spots all thru out. Not only was the carpet sticky, the bathroom did not pass for clean either. However, it was a busy weekend for this hotel as it was Pride Weekend in Toronto, so my Girlfriend and myself put towels on the carpet so we didn't get stuck, and cleaned the bathrooms ourselves. Wasn't too big of a deal, however definitely not what you would expect when walking into a hotel room. However, this isn't the main complaint that we have regarding this hotel. Our problems arose from the lack of customer service that this hotel showed when Customer service should have been the priority. On our second day there, we happened to get stuck in the elevator between the lobby and first floor. Altogether, we had 9 people in the elevator, capacity on license was 12. None of us blame the hotel for the elevator breaking, however the actions taken by the staff from the time the alarm button was pushed to the time of our checkout the following day are their own faults. First and foremost, we had to press and hold the alarm button for minutes before finally the front desk manager came to see what was going on. He then went back to his desk to call Maintenance, which we were advised would be approx. a 40minute wait. Others that came into the hotel went to the front desk and advised them that with 9 people stuck in an elevator on a day where temperature was in the 30's was unacceptable... that he needed to call Emergency services... This was then done by front desk. During this time, the people in the elevator were resourceful enough to find a lever that opened the bottom door up so that we at least had air. The manager was DEFINITELY neglect in not pointing this out to us. He should have been aware of all procedures that should be followed in an emergency situation. We had to pass our room key thru the bottom crack to people down below who then walked up the four flights to our room for water for us, as again...it was very hot and there was NINE people in there. After they returned with drinks for us, the manager then came to the elevator with FOUR bottles of water. Hmmm, Four bottles, for nine people... LOL You gotta be kidding me! We waited for the fire department, who showed up about 30 minutes into this. They finally got the door above us opened so that we could crawl up and out. However, we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the hotel to FIND a ladder... Once we were out, 7 of us went to our room in the hotel. The manager did not even once contact our room to make sure everyone was o.k. Definitely Not customer service. On day of checkout, the same manager was working front desk. As we approached, he asked us how our stay was!!!!!! ( Didn't even recognize us...) When advised that we were stuck in his elevator the day prior, he asked us "Which time?" Again, failing to show any customer service on his part. He told me what my bill was, and was advised by us that that was not acceptable. We were not going to pay full price, not after the lack of concern shown by the hotel. We were guests, we paid for a service, and definitely did not receive it. He argued with us that he wasn't able to do anything, I advised him that something would need to be done. After arguing back and forth, he finally said he would give us 50% off .. I said, 50% off both nites, meaning one nite would be free, he said "No, only off Saturday nite." He then advised me that there were 12 people in the elevator and that's why it got stuck. We let him know that we had been in the elevator long enuff to count the people numerous times, and there were 9 of us. Although, even if there had been 12, the license on the elevator itself stated capacity was TWELVE!!!!! Therefore, even if he was correct, we should have still been fine. (Day of check out tho, there were signs posted at elevator saying only 6 at a time... handwritten.) We ended up leaving as we didn't appreciate being told we were liars...as well as we didn't appreciate his lack of respect for us, his paying guests. The day after we got home, we then sent off a lengthy email to the hotel as well as to the Comfort Hotels main website letting them know of our experience. After waiting three days, we still had heard nothing. We then forwarded the same email to not only the original recipients, but to also three other email addresses found off other websites for the Comfort Hotel Chains. We then received a response telling us that the email was being directed to the proper department and that we would be hearing something shortly from them. Which, we did. We received an email asking for mailing address and phone numbers. We responded with the information that was requested and heard nothing again from them. We then forwarded all the emails back, advised them that the Comfort definitely is not Customer Service oriented hotel, and asked when something else would be heard. We then received another email stating that it was back in the hands of the hotel where we stayed and that we should expect to receive something in the mail. We were elated when 3 days later we did receive a letter informing us that they were going to rebate us the additional money that we had paid for the Saturday nite. Giving us one nite free after all this hassle. This was just a form letter, and now... over a week later, and a voicemail and another email sent still nothing has been heard. Very poor customer service. Please be forewarned, and stay elsewhere! The Comfort Hotel would possibly learn from the dictionary definition of GUEST... â€“noun 1. a person who spends some time at another person's home in some social activity, as a visit, dinner, or party. 2. a person who receives the hospitality of a club, a city, or the like. 3. a person who patronizes a hotel, restaurant, etc., for the lodging, food, or entertainment it provides. Definitely not an enjoyable experience. Definitely not worth paying to stay.I booked on the hotel's very own website and received a confirmation. I even pre-paid for the lodging because it was a lower rate. When I arrived at the hotel, I tried to gain access into the parking area which is secure but there is an intercom. I pressed the button and a woman answered, asked my name, and said I did not have a reservation. I had my car parked on the sidewalk, running, and she asked me to spell my name again. I did. She again said I did not have a reservation. I told her that there was a mistake, asked if she would open the gate to the parking lot to let me in, and she said, "I'm not allowed to do that." I drove around a few blocks so I could park on the street (which, if you know anything about the French Quarter, is next to impossible most of the time). I went into the lobby, gave my name to the clerk, and she said that she did not have my reservation. No apology at all for the incident when I was trying to gain access at the parking lot using the "Check-In" buzzer and intercom. I told her that I booked online and prepaid and then she asked for my identification (like I was perhaps using another name???). She took my driver license into a back office and was gone for about 5 minutes. She came back out, without my license, and said nothing. Silence. No explanation. No empathy. When I asked if they had my reservation, she replied, "we're checking." Another five minutes passed and another woman came out of the back office with my driver license and said that they had my reservation and that it was pre-paid. Geez, I thought to myself, this is exactly what I just told the clerk 20 minutes ago when she said she "wasn't allowed" to let me in the parking area. I felt like I was the only person who thought that there was something wrong with this because there was no apology and no explanation given. Then I was told that the parking was $20 -- and really, one of the big reasons I stayed here was because, for the last 20 years that I've been staying at this hotel, PARKING HAS ALWAYS BEEN FREE. Ok, so now I'm being told that parking is $20/day but the woman from the back office told the clerk to comp my parking. At this point, I felt like the whole place had gone crazy so I just recapped my experience to the two women. Then I was told if I had given them the confirmation number on the email that I had received, they could have found my reservation better. OK - let's see ... I booked on the hotel's very own website, not Priceline or hotels.com, and now it's my fault that they couldn't find the reservation. I told them that this was a big inconvenience and it wasn't handled very well. In a very dismissive way, the woman from the back office said, "we've changed ownership and we're very sorry." It seemed insincere and half-hearted, especially since I had to practically drag this out of them. Then the clerk asked me for my credit card and I asked what she needed it for and she said that the remote that controlled the parking lot access gate that she gave me needed to be returned and if it wasn't, I would be charged $20. Then the clerk piped up and said, "Sir, it's customary to have a credit card on record." After the horrible manner that I was "greeted," I couldn't believe that this woman was talking down to me and telling me what was customary, especially since I had only asked a question -- I didn't refuse to give a credit card -- I was merely asking what it was going to be used for. Anyway, I got my remote and key and went to my room. It was around 2:30 pm or so and when I got upstairs, there were 2-3 housekeepers all sitting in the hallway. I guess it was close to quitting time. Wierd, but no big deal. I got into my room and, to my surprise, I had been upgraded to a suite which was nice but certainly an empty gesture considering the torture they had inflicted. Apparently renovations are underway which isn't mentioned anywhere that I could see. Electric saws during the day time and their workshop is the 8-foot wide breezeway from the parking lot to the hotel so you have to step around the workmen and the construction debris. Yes, the hotel needs some renovations but the staff needs a makeover. Honesty, hospitality, full disclosure, making sincere apologies -- all things they should learn. I usually stay at Marriott properties but have had a soft spot for this hotel and it was the exception for me. Not any more. I'm done with Le Richelieu -- but here's a warning to anybody who books: Be very careful about your reservation and avoid pre-paying. Print your reseration confirmation out in advance and present it when you arrive at the front desk. Otherwise you'll probably go through the same hell that I did.Do be careful about the hotel – there are SEVERAL Cosmo hotels described here. I travel a lot, in Europe, USA and Asia. Generally, I am polite and accept a lot of things. This time though, I can not do anything else than warn you to do any booking at the Cosmo Hotel, Mongkok, Hongkong, located 88 Tai Kok Tsui road, Kowloon. Why would I say that? They have 5 different room categories, where the suites are the same in size and only differ in the usage (families, single). The room I booked is the 3rd biggest room, and when you see Superior, Executive and then on top of that “Cosmorganic”, you say “WOW” at the first view of their website. When you see the rates and compare them with other hotels, you’ll also say that the hotel must be impressive (since there are hotels with better rates available), as is their website. BUT: - if you are more clever than I was, you check not only the description provided at the pricing section, but go further down and click on the description of the rooms. IF you are clever then with imagination, you may figure out that 20sqm are NOT as big as one would think in the first place, since – that does INCLUDE the bathroom size. So, the room itself has 20sqm MINUS the bathroom, it’s barely more that a bed plus a bit floor space. And yes, indeed I did NOT mention any place where you can store your luggage, or your clothes, since there hardly is any. - Your clothes have to stay in your luggage that you place on the small place at the window, where in the picture at their website the guy sits. That is the ONLY place besides the floor where you HAVE a place for it. Then there is a small hanger for 6 shirts, a safe, and a small box for your underwear. That’s it. If you do travel with family (I heard that some people do that), you are screwed. A second luggage? Well, there is of course the desk, you can use that, right. Or the floor, but then you have to tip-toe around your luggage to get to the bed. - The bath – well, stylish, it is, no doubt. But – do you REALLY want a bathroom that consists of glass (although it’s smoked), where the door does not really fit tidily, and where you share all the noises that usually occur when using a bathroom? I mean, I might not mind when travelling alone, but – again, some people do book a room with a kingsize bed not only to be used as a room for one person… - Ah – yes, the bed. Kingsize, I mentioned, right? I explicitly asked for it, and I got it confirmed while checking in. Well, I am an average European guy, 1.80m and about 85kg, wearing size L. I made a picture of that bed – check that out. I put my shirt on it for reference – the arms are hanging OFF the side of the KINGSIZE bed! Have you ever, EVER, seen a kingsize bed like this? Well, I for sure have not, except here…When I lay my 1.80m flat on that bed, my feet are OFF the bed while my head touches the headboard. I am sure even Asians do have a different understanding of kingsize… - And – the cleanliness of the room. Ok, I admit, Asians are small by default, no offense intended (I like Asians and work with them a lot). But – the …hmm, you can not call it a locker, or closet, it’s more a wardrobe space thing with no door. Anyway – the top of that piece CAN be cleaned, so usually there is no need to keep the dust there, like they do. In lack of space, I tried to place there the cozy cover of the KINGSIZE bed, and was not able to avoid my sneezing – almost a kilo of dust came down then (at least it felt like that) – please check the picture, just for fun (taken AFTER the dust already came down, so that is what’s still left there). Well, nothing really to worry about – I mean, the floor itself was not too clean either. Creamy white in general, it had several dark spots on it, that usually would have been removed at any other hotel I was so far. Not here though. The ultimate fun comes when you try to get a good rate and do not read and understand their terms and conditions. In every other hotel I was before, it was of course also the policy to provide better rates the earlier you book. But here, their rate do mean that, if you book the early bird rate with 30% discount, they REALLY mean that this has to be paid upfront (30 days actually), AND is NOT refundable, even when you booked for 30 days and need to check out after 3 days due to unexpected business needs. The whole money is then meant to be lost. Although I had some of such bookings made in the past at other hotels, I was every time able to rearrange things when there was a need, and pay only for the time I stayed. Mostly even with the agreed rate, some times with the higher daily rate that you would get when booking the same day. Then – additional services can be e.g. WiFi access. Most hotels I know provide WiFi access free of charge. Cosmo on the other hand does not. They charge depending on your booking. It might be the full charge of 132 HKD, or just the service charge of the internet company. Just in the lobby they have a free WiFi access. So – well, after all, I may mention that the hotel has some good sides too, as unexpected as it is. They have a free shuttle going every hour from the hotel to different places (MTR station,City centre). The staff is friendly too. The breakfast buffet is fairly good if you stay not too long, and the lobby is clean. Do NOT check though the restrooms that are close to the restaurant – you may have some hard times keeping your breakfast to yourself, since the time I checked them (3 times during my stay), they were as dirty as on a train station (ok, there are good train stations, but I guess you know what I’m talking about, right?). Even the airport ones are in better shape than the ones here. It might be a temporary problem, but given my experience with the dust I somehow doubt that… Soo – if you STILL book this hotel, you can not say you have not been warned, and I wish you a pleasant stay nonetheless…The reason why we chose this hotel was due to the high TripAdvisor Traveler Rating. At many times during our stay we wondered how could such a poor facility get such a high number of positive reviews. We suspect that it has a lot to do with the type of customer that lands here. If the words trendy, modern, hip, comfortable, and trustworthy mean anything to you avoid this hotel at all costs. If you don't care about any of these things than you might like it. We are not confrontational people, and loved our time in Playa Del Carmen which is an amazing town, so we decided not to complain or cause any fuss during our stay, and minimized the time spent in our room to sleeping and showering only. Instead we would like to share our experience with other travelers so they can avoid a major disappointment. The complete lack of attention to detail manifested itself from the moment we arrived. My complimentary margarita was concocted out of re-used plastic bottles of dubious content and served on a chipped glass. The room (so called suite #21) was the most expensive they offered, at 110 bucks a night was the worst hotel room we had ever stayed at, and we had traveled extensively in all five continents. As soon as you walked in the room you were hit by a strong smell of mildew. They had sprayed some kind of air freshener to cover it up and it was nauseating. The light blue curtains on the windows were filthy. The walls were splattered with stains of various kinds and sizes that made us cringe. The oven did not work the one time we tried to re-heat smth. I guess there is not a lot of baking going on at the Luna Blue. Ha-ha! The furniture was gloomy and smelly. The bathroom was so old and run down, that we were wondering what exactly had been renovated in this hotel? The shower is awkward, and claustrophobic, and the water splashes everywhere making it a constant slipping hazard. The sink was cracked. For 850 pesos (less than the price of a night on this room) you could buy a beautiful Mexican style sink on 5th avenue to replace it and give it local charm. But it was apparent that the people running this hotel do not care that much. We visited about five other hotels of the same range in the area and were positively impressed as they all offered better values than Luna Blue. The Coco Rio next door at 105 dollars a night offers a much nicer suite with a modern kitchenette, impeccable bathrooms, and just as nice lush garden environment. And this is just the facilities. We had a negative experience with the two front desk staff. We trusted Luna Blue's motto from their website that "Every restaurant, tour or activity we recommend is because we like it, not because we’re getting a commission or kickback. " We quickly found out that this was a lie! Alex who I found initially helpful to book us tours to Chichen Itza and the Catamaran to Isla Mujeres, tried to take advantage of us, even though I tipped him for his "research." First, he told us that ChichenItza was 50 USD, but because we didn't have USD, he asked for 1250 Pesos (for two people). Initially he said we could pay directly Aldebaran tour agency, but then wanted us to pay him upfront. He was too fidgety when asking for the money which we didn't like. We chose to pay the agency the next day and they had no idea how much I should be paying, so when I just gave them 1200 Pesos for the tour to test them they agreed. Makes me wonder how much the Luna Blue's cut is. They take commissions on everything including restaurants. While I was inquiring for my tour a local restaurant representative dropped by his cards and started telling them about how they would get 10% commission on all the customers they sent their way. Jaime agreed that he knew how it worked, and they have been doing this for a long time. I understand Spanish perfectly and was puzzled by eavesdropping in this conversation. We never asked them for recommendations from that point on. On the morning of Wednesday the 9th of February, we had to be picked up by 8:00 AM to go to Chichen Itza, and even though on LB's website it says that breakfast is served at 7:30 there was nothing there until 8:00 so we had to start our tour on an empty stomach and no coffee. One might say that it's not a big deal, but it's just kind of continuous nuisances that showed us the lack of care or attentive service from the management. For the tour to Isla Mujeres on the Catamaran Alex asked us for 65 USD. We were already suspecting that this was not the best deal. Just across the street from Luna Blue, on calle 26, there is a tiny travel agency called Mayaluum who sold the exact same tour (again through Aldebaran) for 55 USD and accepted a better exchange rate of 12 Pesos to the dollar. Obviously, this is not about the few dollars that we saved but about the untrustworthiness of our front desk staff! Nobody likes to be taken advantage of, and we recommend that everybody be very suspicious of doing business with the Luna Blue. Shop around for better rates even if it is to go across the street at Mayaluum travel agency. Another annoyance with Luna Blue, is that even though there is a lengthy description or fine print in the reservation nowhere there it says that you can't bring you drinks to the Beach Clubs. You only find this out after you have arrived. The whole beach club cross promotion is another scheme. It only costs the hotel less than 30 Pesos to provide the access to the umbrellas, and once there you must pay extortionist prices for everything. They gave us grief for bringing our own water. It's almost better to put your beach towels on the sand (all beaches in Mexico are opened and free to the public) and not have to deal with the beach clubs. The only positives are that the cleaning ladies are quite nice and polite, and our room was quiet. The tropical garden is nice, but so is every other hotel's that we visited for comparison. The sheets were clean, which made our stay bearable. Again, we loved Playa Del Carmen, the beach, and the food at every restaurant we tried, and will definitely come back to stay at a nicer hotel for a better price. The hotels that we visited and would consider as much better values would be Hacienda Paradise (20 bucks more per night gets you a chic room with marble bathroom and a swimming pool). Hotel Aqualuna on 10th ave and Calle 14 is a very nice boutique hotel, with much nicer finishes at 70 bucks a night. If you want a very nice hotel even closer to the beach Riviera del Sol is a fantastic choice on 1st avenue and Calle 30.The unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad (including asking for salad dressing) and was instead given a quesedilla.Slow service, but when you're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20, who really notices?Awful Food, Inept Service, Amazing Beach We returned yesterday (12/31/2003) from a six-day vacation at this resort. As you may gather from the title, we did not have a great time. For those short in time, I will describe why not to go to this resort, and if you are intent on going, make sure you read this long treatise as it will prepare you for your trip. I encountered the reviews here when it was too late for me, so I hope these will be of help.1. The food at the resort is unacceptable. It is difficult to provide a menu of foods that were not tasty but everything from the presentation, to the actual deep-fried-everything and the nasty griddles in use, makes dining a nightmare. 2. If you wish to get the better courses being offered (pasta with sauce, fish, omelets to name a few) you will have to stand through long lines (15 minutes or more). 3. The wait staff is clueless you ask for a drink and maybe 20 minutes later someone will meander to your table and provide you with what you asked. I normally went to the bar and served myself. 4. There are 3 restaurants that require reservations. To reserve normally 2 days in advance, you have to stand in very long lines in the morning. The restaurants are never reserved to capacity and always get sold out . The food there is still eons better than the one in the dining rooms. 5. If you book your trip not through a wholesaler (Liberty Travel, Air Canada, etc.), you will be looked upon as a weirdo. Worse, any travel arrangements (daytrips or other excursion) are made DIRECTLY with the person you speak with at the guest services area. We had a trip cancelled on us (no one bothered to tell us and we waited for an hour for nothing) and then had to wait for another half day to the person who sold us the trip to pay us back. In other words, the hotel does not vouch or back the reservation process, and no one found that to be bizarre. With almost $200 online, I doubt anyone will remain serene knowing that. 6. There is only intermittent supply of warm water for showers. There is never warm water between 4 and 6 PM, when you normally would want to wash. 7. No entertainment is offered other than a very lame show the staff of the resort presents at night. Television reception is rather bad and consists of ESPN, CNN and sometimes the Discovery Channel. The resort has a disco but the town itself Bavaro makes Tijuana looks like Paris so there is nothing to do at night. There are no movies on TV or anything. Bring a book. 8. There are no guides that explain the procedures at the resort to you. The staff is really good in not knowing things and when they do try to help, it normally results in forwarding you to another person who will then forward you to another.Now, for the survival guide to the Grand Flamenco resort: It costs $22 to get to the resort from Punta Cana airport in a taxi. Once there, although there is a big sign saying that the check-in time is 3:00 PM and despite the fact that we arrived at 4:00 PM, our room was not ready until 5:00 PM. Could be worse, as during our stay people who made reservations to this specific resort arrived to find out that they simply did not have rooms there, so beware. The reception staff too, is not of the most knowledgeable ilk, and management is an unknown entity. Not knowing appeared to be all too common throughout our visit. The rooms and the grounds are impeccably clean and well groomed. 'King size' beds are actually two full-size beds positioned next to each other. Not the most romantic arrangement. If your room is next to the main pool, you may have trouble sleeping because of the show that runs till past 11 PM and often the entertainment crew will blast its music deep into the night (1 AM is common). The resort's beach is truly beautiful with a clean strip of white sand and turquoise water and tall palm trees. The water is warm and the waves are a lot of fun. The swimming pools, while clean and large, still suffer from a shortage of room when the beach became too windy - something that happened frequently during our stay. People 'park' their towels on the loungers there and leave them taken. The towels are $30 each - if you happen to lose them - an unnerving fact if you think about it. I would have brought my own had I known about this policy. Another aggravating fee is the $15 payment in order to get a LOCK for the safe in the room. Yes, there is a safe. No, there is no native lock. You have to 'rent' it for the duration of your stay. It appears to be common practice among all resorts, though. Not cool if you do not feel like walking around with cash in your hands while who knows what is cleaning/fixing your room. The resort has 8 locations providing meals: the buffet - the main dining room; the beach club - a dining room on the beach; Home Rums ( ) which offers burgers and deep-friend everything, a pizza stand , a taco stand , an Italian restaurant, a Mexican restaurant and a steak house. The last three require reservations and the main dining rooms suffer from food that makes military rations seem sublime. The stands actually have good food, require no reservations, and have the best waiters, and are located between the Italian and Mexican restaurants. Finally, communications: local calls made from the room are expensive almost $5 each. International calls are even more expensive. My ATT wireless international phone (TDAM and GSM) was online but the local system refused to let it call out. There is an Internet caf茅 of sorts at $7 per 30 minutes, but just outside the resort you can find a cheaper Internet caf茅. Many people at the resort attributed these ills to the fact that it is new. For $220 per night, I deserve so much better. Occidental Hotels, which owns this resort, apparently operates many other locations with better success, but this one is a complete and utter dud.This was the worst hotel I have ever had the great displeasure of staying in. I've paid less for a room in NYC and I've paid more, but what you get for your money at this Sheraton compares extremely unfavorably with any other hotel I have ever stayed in. It's not because the hotel is busy and noisy -- although it's both of these -- one must expect this when staying in a large NYC hotel, but is solely the result of a poorly trained, extremely rude staff, who don't have the first clue about how to provide satisfactory customer service. First of all, when I called ahead of time to confirm my reservation (it wasn't showing up on SPG) and asked to be transferred to the front desk, I was transferred to a recording system, and then put on hold until the computer hung up on me. This happened three times. I hope some of you can understand the frustration of this, and the ominous feeling this would give a guest about their prospective stay. So I called back and asked to speak with an on-duty manager. They connected me to a woman named Andrea Williams. I explained my frustration at being hung up on three times, and that I just wanted to confirm my reservation. She simply confirmed my reservation and asked if there were anything else she could do for me. I said an apology would be great and some indication that she might look into whatever the problem was with the phone system would be appropriate. She very disingenuously said she would and hung up on me. No apology. Just rudeness. This is not an appropriate response for anyone in a customer service position. So I called Gary Sims, the hotel manager, and left him a voicemail letting him know about my experience and how it left me very unexcited about my coming stay. Of course, he never bothered to respond. Upon checking in, I found the hotel extremely noisy and busy, but as I said this is to be expected. There was a long line at the understaffed reception desk, but I was happy that my Starwood Gold Status saved me from that debacle. The room was small, but adequate. I noted that the room was quite warm, and immediately set the thermostat to its coldest position and put the fan on high. I then went down to meet friends for dinner. When I returned I had been out of the room for several hours, and it was still too warm for me to sleep comfortably. I like to sleep in a cooler than average room. Temps should be below 70 degrees, or I really have a hard time sleeping. This is why hotel a/c and heat units have thermostats...or so I thought. It was now about midnight, so I called down to the front desk. Again it was inadequately staffed and there was no one to answer guests questions...I waited on hold for nearly 15 minutes before getting to talk to someone. They said they'd send up someone from engineering. I waited....no one showed up. I tried to call the front desk again, but again too long a wait. It was now 12:30am and I just decided it would be better to visit the front desk personally. After waiting -- even more disgruntled guests were there now, and only two receptionists were present at this huge hotel -- I asked if I could change rooms to a cooler room, they said they would send someone up, I said that I'd already waited for someone to come up. They said they get him there quicker. Finally an engineer showed and -- of course -- told me there was nothing he could do. Oy! Back down to the front desk I went. After waiting another twenty minutes out came Mr. Long -- a manager -- to take care of me...Yeah! He came up to my room and announced that the temperature was fine! Hallelujah, I'd been up and complaining for absolutely no reason. All I needed was Mr. Long to tell me that my discomfort was all in my head. I explained it was not a comfortable temperature for me. He suggested I sleep on top of their "heavenly bed" blanket. "After all," he explained, "it's a heavy blanket." (I wouldn't allow this man to run a Nathans Hotdog stand in New Jersey, nevermind a hotel in NYC!) Absolutely, outrageously rude and incompetent. Where does Sheraton train its employees? Attica? I told Mr. Long that since they were unable to deliver an adequate room, I simply wanted to check out immediately so that I could check into the W Hotel nearby -- at an additional profit for his parent company Starwood by the way. He refused and let me know that I would be charged for that evenings accomodations no matter what. After a long argument he finally agreed to do me the "FAVOR" of not "PENALIZING" me if I chose to check out the following day. INCREDIBLE! I checked into the W New York the next day. And although the initial room they put me in was also too warm, you'll never guess what they said... They said, "we are so sorry Mr. Carp, please let us find you a more comfortable room." Which they promptly did...and I lived happily ever...well for the next two days. Point is, it takes so little to make a dissapointed guest into a satisfied guest. We can all understand when there are issues with equiptment or other things outside of the personal control of hotel employees. What is absolutelty unacceptable is a staff that cannot simply understand that all a guest needs is a sincere apology and a genuine effort to correct that which has gone wrong. Stores like Nordstroms, and many other companies have recognized the value of such a philosophy, and train their employees accordingly. In it's New York Hotel and Towers I urge Sheraton to start from scratch, as it will never serve its customers adequately until the replace all of its managers. Do yourself a favor and stay at any other hotel in Manhattan. My mother liked the Marriot in Times Square very much, and I've had excellent stays at the W New York, the W Tuscany, Swishotel's The Drake, and The Paramount. Very Sincerely, Ed CarpSince I needed a hotel in London for my family for a couple of days only, and I did not mind a "budget/tourist" place, I chose "St. George's Hotel" in Pimlico/Victoria (St. George's Drive). I thought that it would be fine, as Eurostar thad it listed as a favorite. I am having a very hard time understanding why anyone would list St. George's as a favorite. And, before I go on, please understand that I am familiar with London, and with the type of hotel this is--I have stayed in many in the same category, in the Victoria and Bloomsbury areas, as well as in other parts of the UK. I did not want, nor did I expect, anything but a clean room, polite innkeepers, and a breakfast if it were promised. I was not expecting the Savoy, in other words. First, I called the hotel the day before our scheduled arrival to make sure all was in order, and to ask if we could keep our bags there until check in time. The woman on the phone was not only rude, but hung up on me. I called back, and she said she did not have a reservation for us (I had a confirmation from Eurostar, and had already paid for the room). I asked her, politely, to please double check, as I was sure there had to be a mistake. She just put the phone down and yelled to someone else. The second person got on the phone, and I started the whole process over. I gave her my surname, the Eurostar reservation confirmation, the works. She said they did not have it. At this point, I asked if they had any family rooms available, even if they could not find the reservation from your company, as reckoned I could straighten it out later. She said "NO!" I continued to hold my frustration at bay, and said I would call back. Next, I called Eurostar, and the rep was polite and helpful. She asked me if I minded being put on hold while she investigated, and said she would call the hotel. About 3 minutes later, apologizing for the wait, and said she had called and that we were all set. Just to make sure, I called the hotel again, and the very same woman now told me that they had our reservation. Huh? She did not apologize, nor did she offer an explanation. I have no idea what the problem is with the staff at the St. George's, but there is definitely a problem. My husband asked for the "free" internet access code, and was charged 4 pounds. It did not work until the night manager came and reset it. So much for that. The next problem with them came at breakfast. By this time, I had looked for reviews on the web of this hotel, as well as it's own web site (something I wish I had done before booking in they were not good, to say the least) The hotel has two buildings, and one small breakfast room. The tables are so close together, that my daughter (age 10, slim) could not pull her chair far enough away from the guest behind her to fit. We asked if we could move. The very curt, rude woman (who had also been at the front desk) sighed theatrically and then just said "There" in a loud voice. We moved, but the next thing we saw was her telling a single woman (of a certain age) that she had to sit somewhere else than where she was sitting. This lady was booked in because her husband was in hospital nearby. The staff did not ask her, they TOLD her to move. She was near tears. I did not hear one "please" "thank you" or anything of the sort from the entire staff. Of course the guests were the only polite people. The second day, the very rude, curt woman pointed my family and I to a table whose chairs were backed up to a wall with about 3 inches of space between them and the table. I thought "Well, she may have to move us AGAIN" and pulled out the chair for my daughter. It was so close to the wall, that it made a small nick. The woman said "Oh my God, see what you did!" by this time I had had it with her. So I replied "Oh my God, maybe you should get tables and chairs in your breakfast room that actually fit" , She moved us, to another 4 person table. Why she did not seat us there in the first place remains a mystery. AND the breakfast was extremely stingy. My 7 year old son had looked at a photo of an "English Breakfast" and was very excited to have one. Well, not only were they not "full" but Breakfast was only available between 6:30 and 8:30 am. In fact, we were told to get there by 8, or we would not be served as "we stop cooking at 8:30." In all the B and B hotels in which I have stayed, this has never been the case. Also, there was enough room for all of the guests, and refills of juice, etc. if wanted in all of the similar type hotels I had been in. And they did not require that one is down (in line--we were early, and by the time we left each morning around 7:15 (we wanted to get out as soon as possible) there was a queue up the stairs of guests trying to get their promised (and paid-for) breakfast. There is more, but I have gone on enough already. I write this because I know that many of your customers have never been to London, or have not stayed in this type of hotel. Also, you are a trusted company, and if you list it, it implies that the customer can trust that it will be at least a decent experience. The people who run this hotel are rude, and they don't care at all about their guests. I don't people who run this type of place to be super-nice, they work very, very hard, and they don't really have the time. Also, they are inexpensive. BUT there is no excuse for downright rudeness, lying, and general ill-will toward guests. I am asking you, PLEASE remove St George's Hotel (St. George's Drive, Victoria/Pimlico, London) from your "favorites" or preferred list. Or at least that that you don't promote this hotel. Sincerely, Barbara MurrayService cannot get any worse! Stay away! i went to florence with two friends and immediately upon our arrival and presenting the concierge (his name is martina capozza) with our passports, he told us that he does not like americans and america. that was just really awkward since we are his guests. he might as well just come out and say that he does not welcome us at his hotel.also, the hotel advertises itself as being located in piazza indipendenza, a green and peaceful spot. piazza indipendenza is NOT a green and peaceful spot. we arrived at the donatello on 06/17/07, a sunday, and saw piazza indipendenza as a place full of homeless people sleeping on the benches and on the grass. the whole piazza was also full of people selling junk (we saw one man selling used surgicals tools!). i would not recommend walking around the piazza too late in the night.we stayed in room 308, which was located in another building! the walls were very thin so we heard everything that went on in the hallway. the hotel did not offer a safe free of charge. we would have had to pay 2 euros per day for its use (we chose not to use it).when our passports were returned to us, we were informed that we had to pay 12 euros to the HOTEL for making reservations for us to the accademia and uffizi. the hotel charged 2 euros per person per museum/gallery (3 people; 2 museums/galleries). i emailed the hotel asking them to make the reservations for me. when the hotel responded that they will do it, they did not disclose to me that there will be this charge. when they confirmed that they had made the reservations for me, they again did not disclose that there will be a charge. on top of that, each one of us had to pay another 3 euros to the museums/galleries for reserving tickets. so all in all, we paid 30 euros (12 to donatello; 9 to uffizi; and 9 to accademia) for our reservations!!!on the day of our departure, we tried to explain to the concierge that the fees were never disclosed to us until our arrival. he just stared at us and told us that it is their policy. don't you think that if it is their policy, it should be clearly and plainly stated somewhere in writing? i finally told my boyfriend to just pay it even though i don't think we should be charged for it. the concierge responded saying that he did a favor for us and that it costs $100 per hour for my people. i refuse to believe that it his people gets paid 100 euros PER hour. the accademia is just a 5-minute walk from the hotel. and if it is a favor, shouldn't it be free? if it is a service, then it should be disclosed prior to our arrival. and to add to this awful awful experience, the concierge pulled out the F word on us. that is just plain bad business.furthermore, mr. capozza made a mistake with our reservations. he emailed me prior to our arrival and informed me that we have reservations to the accademia on 6/17 and to the uffizi on 6/19 when in fact, our reservations for the accademia were on 6/19 and our reservations for the uffizi were on 6/17. we did not have any problem getting into the accademia, but when we went to the uffizi, they were not happy that we got the dates mixed up. my boyfriend had to plead with the ticket office lady to ask her to make an exception for us. she let us into the uffizi, but gave us an attitude and told us to be more careful with the dates. well, we showed up on the wrong day because we relied on the hotels confirmation email!we ate breakfast only on the morning of our departure from the hotel. the dining room was tiny! i'm a small person (5'1; 120 lbs.) and i felt really cramped in there. the tables and chairs were literally touching each other. as for the food, it was way below average. the breakfast consisted on some fruits, breads, very thinly sliced ham and cheese, jams, butter, and hard croissants and danishes. coffee and cappuccino were dispensed from a machine. breakfast was from 7:30 to 9:30 (the hotels we stayed at in rome and venice both had breakfasts from 7 to 10).the air conditioning and lights in the room requires that you put in your key card in order to keep them on. we went in june, so it was pretty hot and it would be nice to come back to our hotel room at the end of the day to find it cool. here a trick to fix the problem: put a cardstock weight/type of paper in the slot and the AC and lights will stay on all day. (i'm sure the hotel isn't happy with this but i paid food money for my room, so i want it to be cool when i return to it.)we stayed in a triple, which consisted of 3 twin-sized beds and our own bathroom. the quality of the beds and bathroom is acceptable for a 3-star hotel.overally, this hotel caused us a lot of grievances and upsetted us in so many ways.Our trip to Maui started at the Grand Wailea when we were greeted by superb bell staff when we arrived. I cannot say enough good things about the front line workers as soon as you arrive. Upon arriving at the check in desk in the late afternoon (almost 6pm) we were greeted with the question of can I see your visa and ID. once that was provided to them we were presented with keys to our room and was told nothing else. There was no mention of where the restaurants were located, what restaurant was open to people without a reservation (kinda hard to make a reservation when you arrive at meal time) and no map of the hotel was given. we were basically on our own to figure out where to get a meal after traveling 8 hours to get to our 5 star hotel. we went to a couple of the restaurants on the resort to try to get in to get a meal the first night and were told "sorry you need a reservation..we can see about getting you in later that evening" needless to say we went to bed with no supper. I do have to say that when we arrived in our room I read over all the info that about the restaurants and the features in the hotel and it was not until day 9 of our 10 day trip that a room service menu magically appeared in our room. The swimming pool was great, the water eleavator was a blast but the chair situation around the pool and on the beach were a joke. The first 2 days at the hotel we were very pleased to find that when you go to the beach there are chairs and umbrella's that were brought to you at your desired location. we had no problems at all finding chairs and umbrella's come the 7th day it was another story. After traveling the island and taking a break from the hotel water we went at 10 am to the beach and asked for 4 chairs and a umbrella and were told sorry we are all out of them right now come back in 15 to 20 minutes, we have people doing a sweep of the beach looking for unoccupied chairs. I stood by the chair and umbrella sign out stand with another lady who was having the same problem. when her husband came from the beach and told her he needed money so that he can pay the people doing the sweeps to find him 6 chairs he explained to his wife if he gave the money to the young men they would get him chairs right away. sure enough, not even 5 minutes later while standing in front to the chair sign out spot with his wife he came back and said we have chairs now and they left. I still had not been accomodated with chairs or an umbrella and My family arrived ahead of his. So we tried his theory...People when you are told there are no chairs left no worries, here are the steps you take to get some...step 1....ask for an umbrella or 2 depending on your family size. the young men will deliver it to your preferred location. step 2....while the young men are setting up the umbrella tell them that you have a few bucks for the amount of chairs you need. with our family it cost 8 dollars to have them find us 4 chairs. and we got them within 5 minutes of preforming step 2 . step 3...enjoy the sun. sit back people and watch the ones around you, it is very interesting. the young men who are serving patrons of the hotel on the beach in a half hour period definately make good money, the one we watched made at least 30 dollars from what we could see doing the chair sweep policy. chairs and umbrella's are left occupied by one person. usally a woman reading a book. she will be there for about half an hour and then she will disappear for about half an hour. If you go to the pool area (which was where my kids were splitting their time between the beach and the pool) you will see that same lady that was on the beach with her allotted amount of chairs, sitting at her other allotted amount of chairs next to the pool. This will go on all day as we found There are also some downfalls to the money for chairs policy in this hotel. We were a victim of the chair sweep on the 8th day. my family was on the beach enjoying the sun when we decided we should go to the ocean as a family of four and enjoy the waves and the ocean.we were gone less than 3 minutes when we witnessed the same young man who accomodated us with chairs the day before take our towel off of one of our chairs and slide it over to an umbrella next to us for 4 women we go our chair back however immediately after we got our chair back the 4 women disappeared to the pool area for over 3 hours. wonder why they needed our chair and how much did they have to pay for these chairs. for the next 2 days we could not swim in the pool or on the beach as a family as we had to have at least one person or more guarding our chairs. IF you drink coffee in the morning (provided by the hotel in rooms) make sure you leave your sugar packages next to the sugar holder on the counter,that way the cleaning staff know that you are in need of more sugar. we had many days in our stay that we were drinking black coffee due to the fact that we cleaned up our sugar packages off the counter. the days that we left the empty sugar packages on the counter our sugar was always restocked. beware that if you want to book a tour that most of the tours do not come to the Grand Wailea to pick you up, you have to drive yourself. BE SURE to rent a car at the airport when you get off your plane. we did not know that and found that you pay more for a car rental at the hotel than at the airport. shopping, there are very few options for shopping around this hotel. If you want reasonable priced shopping or meals, you have to rent a car. My family was very disappointed in what we got at the hotel for the price of the room. we will not be stayinig here againBeware: Deceptive Advertising Hurts! This hotel is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in my whole life. I felt like I was in some Chevy Chase Vacation movie. Things just kept getting worse and worse. I booked the room on Hotels, it was rated at 3 starts (mysteriously it is at 2 now...) and I spent over $100 a night and was very disapointed. The other people I went to San Francisco with all got nicer rooms for about two-thirds the price. They booked their rooms on other leading travel websites (I won't mention which, shop around) but they got rooms at the Sir Francis Drake for about 70 bucks and the rooms there are very, very nice. In fact if I had just walked into the Holiday Inn on Friday night I could have gotten a nice and decent room for under $80. I've seen other reviews where they got a room at Grant Plaza for under $40 per night, I wouldn't feel so extremely ripped off if I had gotten to pay that much.Here is a numbered list of the reasons why I was dissatisfied with my room at the Grant Plaza, please read them all so you know what you are getting into before you book a room here. 1) The pictures of the exterior of the hotel on Expedia, Hotels, etc. are very misleading. The hotel does not look anything like the pictures in my opinion. In fact I suspect the pictures to be doctored since there is not even cable car line that runs in front of the hotel as you are lead to believe. 2) The pictures of the rooms look absolutely nothing like the room I got. When I opened the door it practically hit the bed, try to imagine the stunned look on my face as I dropped my bags. In the center of the room was a double size bed and there is approximately 2 feet around the bed get from the front door to the bathroom... and that's it! The closet only took up what precious space we had to move around and the bathroom was very tiny. I'm not sure how me and my girlfriend we able to pull it off without one of us standing out in the hallway while the other got ready. I estimate the room to be 9 feet by 9 feet.3) The night staff was very rude. Whenever my girlfriend asked him a question he pretended like she did not exist. He would turn to me and answer her questions as though I was the only person standing there. Very bizzare! 4) The elevator ride felt very dangerous, I only rode it once, I took the stairs to the fifth floor for the rest of my stay, even when I carried all my bags down to check out. Ominous signs are posted all over the place to never occupy the elevator with more than 4 people. The elevator was also very loud, God help your soul if you get stuck with a room near the elevator, you won't be getting any sleep.5) No alarm clock. I woke up every 5 minutes to look at my watch to make sure I didn't wake up late. Exhausting!! 6) Bar soap and mini bottles of shampoo are NOT provided... What you get is a kind of soap dispenser commonly seen in gas station bathrooms. It's only saving grace is that it is labeled Euro-Bath. Good thing I bring my own soap and shampoo. 7) The towels smelled like mildew. Yes mildew. I felt so clean, fresh, and ready to face the world, yessiree. I could detect the faint aroma of mildew on myself all day long.8) There was a newer TV, but get this, no cable television. Every Motel 6 I see has a sign up that says they have cable and HBO and whatnot... I guess cable is too expensive a luxury when you charge your guests only $100+ a night. 9) The walls are paper thin. When somebody walks past in the hallway you can hear 100% of their conversation, and they can hear 100% of yours. Also, all traffic noise, construction noise, and even the guy talking to himself on the corner down the street sound like they are all originating from inside your room. Kinda like those Nature Sounds to Relax to CDs... only not. The traffic noise continues at all hours of the night with race car drivers peeling out and ambulances screaming by. Nearly impossible to sleep, and I'm a heavy sleeper. I plainly heard the couple next door having raucous sex, normally voyeurism is fun, but not when your eyes are bloodshot from lack of sleep.10) No air conditioning. The only way to cool down is to open the window, and that only opens 2 and a half inches. I wanted to go to San Francisco, not Louisiana. 11) The floors creak, and they creak loudly. The people in the room above us were not having a crazy party (we could tell) but whenever they moved it sounded like the roof was going to cave in on us. 11) The shower in the bathroom is so small that when to turn around to get your back wet you are likely to hit the shower lever which moves very easily and scald yourself with hot water. 12) The view from my room was a nasty brick wall. 13) The lighting in the room was very dim. 14) The toilet just barely flushes. 15) No iron, I had to take my shirt to a drycleaner to get pressed.16) No coffeemaker17) No breakfast18) Parking was 17.50 per night and two blocks away. 19) The bathrooms were NOT remodeled like the website says.20) The room was in dire need of repairs, touch up paint, and not to mention a WORKING SMOKE DETECTOR!!Maybe the rooms on the top floor are nice (from outside I noticed larger windows up there with a jealous twinge) but you are really rolling the dice. I also have no way to know if the upper levels are available on any kind of regular basis.I wish I had taken a picture of the room to share with all of you, but the thought of photographing something so vile never occurred to me. Some of other reviews you might read make it sound like Grant Plaza is the promised land for travelers, but those people probably paid between $20 and $40 a night, which is fitting for a hotel of this kind. The only memorable part of my stay at the Grant Plaza was the easy access to the fire escape through a rickety doorway at the end of the hall. It felt adventurous to hang out 50+ feet above the street on a metal platform and watch the days business pass beneath you.Whew, I almost feel better now.NOT as described This will probably take some time but bare with me as I would want someone to be as honest...We have been to the Bahamas, St Lucia, Aruba and Riviera Maya in Mexico. This was by far THE WORST vacation we have ever been on.Dreams is on the Atlantic side of the island (you don't have that caribbean water there - it's choppy and has ALOT of rocks - husband cut leg up). THere are no other resorts near you so you are kind of stuck.Day 1 - Wasn't too happy with the $10 per person tax you have to pay at the airport. Travel agent didn't tell us about this either. Ride from airport was about an hour. Very bumpy.Arrived at the resort, lobby was gorgeous. We booked the preferred club for an extra $550 for the week. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! Ice cold towel to refresh face with was nice. No champagne tho. When we pulled up, told them we are in the preferred club, they put us in a beat up red pick up truck (I literally had to sit on my husband's lap because of the stick shift). They drove us to building 6 through the garbage area of the resort where the preferred club check in is. Check in was quick. Room wasn't ready so we decided to get lunch at the SeaSide Grille. Cheesesteak was HORRIBLE. The meat tasted processed. The only thing good was the bread. Servers do not speak much English at all. We finally got our room (#7116). Was OK room. Nothing to write home about. We tried to connect to the wireless internet (we thought it was included in our room - website says complimentary internet connection for preferred club. Well - it's not included in the room. You have a complimentary connection in the preferred club lounge...that is it. We had to pay $25 for this service for our room. Pool - gorgeous....Pool bar AWESOME (thanks Wilson!!!) Just didn't care for the topless french women walking around with so many children there.We ate in the buffet (World Cafe) the first night. Food was OK, again...just OK.Casino - what a rip off. They call it American Blackjack. They neglect to tell you with Dominican Republic rules....Don't waste your money.Day 2 - Breakfast at buffet. Omelets were good, Crepe station was good too. Went for our meeting with Pietro Tours (Cesar was cool). They went over all of the excursions with us. Told us there was a shopping area 10 minute walk down the street. Decided to take a walk over there. As we were walking there was a SECURITY GUARD on a bike that followed us to the shopping area....told us it was too dangerous without security. OH MY GOD....shopping was typicle. 20 shops with the same stuff trying to get $20 US for a coffee cup. Found a shop that has a girl from the Bronx there. She was cool. Didn't try to rip us off. Spent the day at the pool bar lunch at the BBQ on the beach - burger was OK, hot dogs SUCKED!!. Dinner Bordeaux- Husband had to wear long pants because of dress code (air conditioning SUCKS!!!). Sandals doesn't even have a dress code and this resort is no where near that calibre. Food was good. Better than the buffet. Called it a night after dinner. Ordered room service at around midnight....LIMITED menu, and not very good.Day 3 - Ordered room service for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, was OK. Spent the entire day at the pool and relaxed. Dinner - we went to Himitsu (the Japanese) for hibatchi. You HAVE to be there 45 minutes before the seeting for Hibatchi and hope they take your name. They only have 3 tables and do seeting at 6, 7:30 and 9:30. Food was good. LONG PANTS FOR MEN!!!Day 4 - went on the ATV excursion. Had a great time. Very expensive ($198 for 2 people). Was 1/2 day trip and was only 15 minutes from resort. Took a nap when we got back and just did the buffet again (husband didn't want to wear long pants - it was soooooo hot).Day 5 - Spent the day at the pool again. Dinner El Patio (Mexican). We walked out on dinner. The food was HORRIBLE!! We ordered fried chicken tacos for appetizer (there was no chicken in them and the cheese was spoiled - frozed mexican appetizers are better than these). For entrees we ordered chicken fajita quesadillas. Again, cheese was spoiled and barely any chicken. We weren't the only people walking out during our dinners. There was another couple that walked out also. We just grabbed something at the buffet. They had show in the theatre that night. Was fun to watch.Day 6 - Went to breakfast buffet and then went on the Caribbean Festival Snorkel. They picked us up around 1:30. It's over an hour to get to the boat. You have to take a speedboat to the catamaran. We snorkeled, went swimming with sharks and then interracted with stingrays (stingers surgically removed). This was by far the best snorkel trip we have ever been on. They will videotape it for $35. Worth it...but we were leaving the next morning and would not be able to get it to the resort on time. They had carnival dancers on the boat as well.Dinner - we thought we would go to Bordeaux (french) for our last meal since it was pretty good on night 2. Well, it took 40 minutes to get our appetizers, there were no scallops in there. Then they tell us they are out of french onion soup (are you serious??). Then they bring us this shrimp and calamari in a pineapple that was HIDEOUS!!!!. Our entrees came and our beef was like leather. Didn't even bother to stay for dessert and coffee.Day 7 - FINALLY GETTING OUT OF THIS HELL!!! Went to Preferred Club to check out. We voiced our opinions and basically wanted to know what we got for paying $550 for this Club. A newspaper and the lounge. We didn't get the turn down service except for 2 nights. There was no pillow menu. The room was the same as a deluxe room in any other building. There was no upgraded room service. There were no upgraded room toiletries. WOW - what a RIP OFF!!!!! They weren't happy with us complaining about everything, and I honestly could care less. They were scooting another couple out to the lounge so they wouldn't hear us. We stopped at the lounge to tell them on our way out. The Concierge just printed a bill and told us we would have to go to the front desk to pay. Are you kidding me????? The front desk????? What happened to VIP check in and check out?Overall....the resort is pretty. The beach sucks. The pool bar is AWESOME - ask for Wilson. The food SUCKS for the most part. NO ONE really speaks English. It's dangerous to walk 10 minutes to the shopping area. Entertainment was good. Excursions were fun. Go to Riviera Maya in Mexico or Aruba for a really enjoyable vacation.Traveler Beware Worse Hotel Ever NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE I want start by saying this was the worse vacation I have ever taken in my life. ALL-INCLUSIVE means all is included and you don't need your wallet or have to pay extra for any food, or drinks... Don't forget to bring extra money when vacationing here because you'll need it...The management at the hotel is awful and rude have a total disrespect for there guests. We originally booked to at the Cayenea there exclusive side. Don't waste your money for a premium that does not exist. We were finally moved over to the LTI side after battling Cataryna from Guest services after she could not justify there amenities , of premium liquor at one bar and an ala-carte menu for lunch for an extra $500.00 per person, we where 3 women traveling together. Too make matters more insulting I spoke with Cataryna on a conference call with the travel agent in regards to there amenities (premium liquor) and she lied to me and the travel agent. Knowing that one of the travelers has an extreme medical allergy to potato so she can only drink some types of Vodka, and checked the brands they carry. With all of that said she still lied!The problems started upon arriving to the hotel immediately when we requested a ground floor room because one of the girls hurt her ankle and was on crotches. The front desk was annoyed by this misfortune because they had to make another room available. We waited patiently for the room and grabbed lunch. When we got into our room we noticed that the cushions from the couch where outside and when we asked the room maid she said they were drying out for 2 days and were moldy. Not only the cushions but the bed as well. So one of us shared a bed, who wants to sleep in a moldy bed... Our sliding glass doors and windows did not lock and our safe as well. So we went to the front desk and asked that they be fixed. Well that was our fault since we changed rooms. They fixed everything reluctantly and not understanding the danger of unlocked doors on a ground floor with 3 girls. We where told that if you stay at the Cayenea you have access to premium alcohol throughout the resort. Well that is not the case and you can have premium at one bar but must pay for it at all other bars... That bar closes around 6.00 pm! The room was spacious but really moldy and just stunk. When I say there are no extra amenities I mean you have to retrieve your towels on the other side of the resort daily. The Cayenea is a time share not a resort, and the going rate is 250.00 per week... Our phones did not always work because the wires were hanging out. Upon discovering that we had been scammed we requested to speak to the manager about the lack of amenities and what was stated earlier. No one from Management would speak to us and they sent Cataryna from Guest services to do their dirty work. We demanded that she justify the premium between the two. Well as I said before an ala-carte lunch, and one bar with premium liquor... One Vodka Stoli and some Scotch as well which is not inclusive but advertised as is. After 2 hours of arguing and her saying to bad we have your money deal with it and also the LTI side is completely over booked, but we managed to get a room... she could not or would not tell us what was going to be credited back if anything. Upon arriving to our new room which by the way we carried all of our luggage to... The room was meant for 2 two people max but they brought in a cot and mattress. Well the mattress was just disgusting and should not be viewed by any guest. I mean filthy so slept together again. We got 2 room keys of which only one worked and that could not be fixed either as per mgt. The AC did not work at all so we just sweated it out for 7 days while they tried to repair it twice a day, mind you we complained night and day to get it fixed. It was 90 degrees and 3 people in a sweaty room. When pulled our comforter back to take a nap one of the beds sheets had a fresh blood stains all over it... We again had to go to the front desk because our phone had no dial tone as well. We actually had to supervise them as they stripped the beds down. There was a used tampon in the corner of the bathroom. The tub did not drain properly and we had no lights! Food: If you like raw turkey and really bad seafood as in spoiled you will love this place. The restaurants are not all-inclusive they have a limited menu and the rest is ala-carte and not cheap... They offer a great cheese table. I came across so many people that had gotten sick from the food that I was very careful in what I ate. The grill has excellent chicken and veggies... Stay clear from the late night sandwich table. There is no 24hr or late night eatery that is a lie it鈥檚 open till 10.00. The food is catered to the European guest... The selection does not vary always the same. Breakfast is the same daily as well... Stay away from the seafood or lobster by the grill they sit out in the sun all day. Go to Captain Jacks outside the resort for some really good seafood and drinks... Punta Cana is very safe don't fall in that tourist trap info...Alcohol: The beer is great! Anything else is rubbing alcohol and really bad and not worth the hangover or headache from. Bring a bottle with you if you if you can... It is worth lugging around. The wine that is served is watered down and really bad so we just bought a bottle at the restaurant.ICE: They had no ice! Every day! So you drank warm drinks in the sun. When they did get ice it was gone in less than 2 hours...The Good: Beaches are awesome and clean... The room maids and waiters and bartenders are really nice and will go out of there way for you. One waiter brought us coffee from his house and brewed for us to enjoy at the resort. Tip them daily because they really deserve it and will help you out in a pinch. Night life: Very boring after 9.00pm nothing going on or to do... If you like shows then you will be thrilled... The disco really sucks, go outside the resort to dance and have fun. Many of the other resorts offer great clubs and casinos and entertainment for almost nothing...Also be very careful with you room keys as they have your room number on them and they do not change the locks if the key is lost by the previous... Not very safe...GET TRIP INSURANCE (HEALTH) BEFORE YOU GO.. THE DOCTOR AT THE HOTEL CHARGES 200.00 US $$$ A DAY. YOU ALSO HAVE TO PAY FOR A WHEEL CHAIR AS WELL DAILY.. Out of the 60 traveler 40 got sick and one is in the hospital with a stomach infection in the US. One traveler paid $600.00 US for care at the hotel !There are a lot of all-inclusive resorts in Punta Cana that are just better than LTI. Don't waste your money here and it is not ALL-INCLUSIVE so don't be fooled.To whom it may concern: I am writing this letter in hopes that something that can and will be done to fix my situation. Myself as well as four of my friends booked a vacation with Apple Vacations to go to the Sandos Caracol Beach Resort & Spa from August 16th to the 23rd. We were all very excited to go on vacation as would anyone. After arriving at the resort, we go to the front desk and are told that we cannot check in til 3pm, which is no big deal. When booking this vacation we specifically asked that our rooms either be conjoining or next to each other since the five of us could not all fit in one room. The first string of bad luck for us was when the woman at the front desk preceded to tell us that are rooms were not next to each other. They were actually on opposites sides of the resort. Around 3pm we receive our keys. They are not actually keys, they are cards you swipe to get into your room. After walking to our room we attempt to use the keys in which neither or them work. We then knock our neighbors door and ask them if they could call the front desk and tell them our keys are not working. The front desk tells them that we need to go there and get new keys. While waiting for our friends in the other room, an employee brought us the new keys. At this point everything was happening so fast we cannot remember who exactly it was that brought us the new keys. When the employee brought the keys we didn’t think anything of it that they only brought us one key instead of two. So finally we are happy to get into our room. We unpack and go the pool. While at the pool, I stepped into the pool I slipped, hit my knee on the step and fell into the water. There were no signs anywhere saying that it was slippery. As time went by my knee began to swell and turn black and blue immediately. I went back to the room and called my father immediately. He told me he wanted me to see if they had medical attention somewhere on the resort. So I limped all the way the first aid room and got checked out. The gentleman told me that he believed it was just a bad bruise and that he should take IB profeun every four hours. So after buying advil at the gift shop my friends and decided we were going to take showers and go out to eat. Right before leaving our room at around 9pm, myself as well as my friends Keri and Kim go into our safe to put all our money, passports and cell phones in. We set our code and double check it to make sure it is locked, which it is. We leave our room and pull on the door to make sure it is locked, which it is. So the girls and I go out to eat and walk around the resort for a little. Because it was our first day there we were all tired so we decided that we were going to go back to the room and go to sleep. This was around 10:45pm. We went to sleep. The next morning around 9am we woke and saw a letter on our door saying that our room was going to be changed so we can be next to our friends. While packing up all our possesions we took everything out of the safe. Right away we all realize that all of our cash was gone. Right away, we called our friends who were on the other side of the resort to tell them. We went directly to the front desk and demanded to speak to the manager. The first person we spoke with was Martina. She explained to us that they were going to do a full investigation. She said that the security was going to check our safe to see if it was opened while we were out the night before. She also explained to us that we would only get our money back if someone opened the door with a key and if that time matched the time the safe was opened. Highly unlikely if you ask me. Martina told us to come back around 4pm. We all went back and met with the Deputy Manager Sergio Delgado. He sat us down and told us that they did not find anything suspicious. He then proceeded to tell us that in order for him to help us, we would have to tell him the truth. He basically thought we were lying. Not only was he mocking us, he did not try to accommodate us at all. Mr. Delgado began to get very hostile and aggressive with us. He gave us the impression that if we decided to file a police report we would be in more trouble. At this point we feared for our safety. Due to this conversation, my four friends and I decided we wanted to leave as early as possible. To make things even worse, we heard that Hurricane Dean was coming. We met with your Apple representative , Maria at the resort and told her we wanted to leave. She said that because the hurricane was coming that a lot of people were going home and that we wouldn’t have to pay for our flight home. The earliest flight was Sunday, August 19th. We went back to see her on Saturday August 18th, to find out what time we had to be ready by on Sunday. She said that we were going to be picked up at 7:30am. On the 19th, we went to the front desk and saw a woman telling an employee at the front desk that she received a phone call saying that her flight was delayed. It turns out that we were on the same flight. We never received a phone call. Now the bus was going to pick us up at 11am. In the meantime, we went back to Sergio Delgado’s office and asked if we can have a copy of the times our safe and door were opened. He said he would email us. That never happened. Finally we got to the airport and waited on line to have our bags checked. We were then told that the flight is booked and we cannot get on the plane and that the next flight would not be until Thursday August 23rd due to the hurricane that was coming. Our parents finally found a flight for us the next day so as a result we had to sleep in the airport and our all of our parents paid $750 each for our flight home. I would not reccommend this resort to anyone. It is not safe at all. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.They were dry, stale and pretty flavorless.Booking a room at the Griffin House Hotel from my home in Australia, I imagined from the description a small cosy B&B, with some cute but nice rooms, a filling breakfast and free wireless internet. After all, for 70 quid a night, it would be quite reasonable to expect â€˜niceâ€™. You donâ€™t get â€˜greatâ€™ or even â€˜goodâ€™ in London for less than 120 a night. Iâ€™ve stayed in many hotels over the years. Some cost a lot less than the Griffin House and were virtually five-star apartments (The Salisbury Hotel on 57th Street in New York is amazing), others cost a lot less and were hideous (The Globe Hotel, Oswiecim, Poland begs some politically incorrect comparisons with the former death camp across the railway line). But the Griffin House Hotel takes the Golden Turd in the All-Time Overpriced Dump category. When I checked into the Griffin House and was struck by the profound sourness of the staff. Since I decided to give up living in Britain during the Thatcher tyranny, a kind of officious and humourless pseudo-customer-service has emerged, where you the customer are told youâ€™re very important yet treated as an undeserving cretin with the audacity to be giving them money. But the Griffin House staff have entered a new Superleague of crapulence in the arena of customer f***-you-ness. I paid for my two nights on arrival and was given the key to my room â€œdown the stairs and next to the Breakfast Roomâ€�. In the basement? Yes, in the basement. The room was so small that the bedside tables were across from the creeky double bed, since there was virtually no room either side. The walls were stained by a tide-mark of damp rising from the floor. The shower was in a cupboard. Yes, a cupboard shower. Its nozzle bracket hung loosely from the wall, and when I took a shower the floor quickly with filled with water around my ankles. The toilet cupboard was fitted with a motion-detector air freshener, that spat Glade at me every time I entered the room, and if I dared move while sitting on the seat. Donâ€™t take too long having a dump â€“ youâ€™ll come out smelling like a disinfectant cake. The signal for the free wireless internet was unserviceably weak. I complained, nicely, and was told I could get a better signal in the Breakfast Room next door. But I was then questioned by other staff about what I was doing loitering there. â€œWhat room are you from?! What room are you from?!!!â€� The view from my window was the window of the kitchen, six inches away, which lit up 6:30am every morning and emanated with the clanging of pots. The first morning I just wanted the hell out of the Hotel, so I avoided the free breakfast in the Breakfast Room and ate at the Pret a Manger near Marble Arch. The second morning, however, I thought, hey, what the hell, itâ€™s paid for, I might as well get something for my 70 quid a night. And, I have to say, this decision it worth every single penny. I was treated to a new and unaired episode of Falty Towers. It was truly hilarious. I took a seat at one of the three four-seater tables (a curious choice of seating, giving that the hotelâ€™s rooms are either singles or doubles). The cook/waitress/entertainment came out of the kitchen to take my order. I had Option 1 or Option 2, the basic difference being eggs or cereal, and the choice of tea, coffee or hot chocolate. Could I order a black coffee? The milk is on your table, of course, the coffee comes out black. And how dare I ask such a ridiculous question. Since the coffee I ordered never showed up, they could have got away with spoiling me so much for choice anyway. I was distracted from my scrambled eggs by a French woman and her two daughters entering the Breakfast Room at 9:40am. The cook/waitress ordered â€œSit! Sit...! Come on...! SIT! We stop serving at 10am...! Sit or you wonâ€™t get anything!â€� The party of three was coerced to sit across two different tables, the kids looking quite distressed and intimidated. Their order was taken with the same minus-scale level of respect I had experienced. Then the cook/waitress brought out three glasses of orange juice and slammed them down in front of each diner as though she was closing an auction. I was expecting next a large pot of gruel and Mr Bumble shouting â€œMORE?!â€� It would have been hilarious had the kids not have been trembling. I can just imagine what they would say when they get back to Lille or Paris or Lyon and tell their friends and family about the â€œtres merdeâ€� time theyâ€™d had in London. Since Iâ€™ve stayed at the Salisbury Hotel in New York, Iâ€™ve told so many people about it, and I know friends have told their friends, and so that placeâ€™s reputation will only grow and it will get more clients. The staff at the Griffin House just do not get this. I mean, who cares if youâ€™ve had a crap time in their dumpy hotel, when thereâ€™s still plenty of suckers out there, like I was, who read the misleading description of the hotel, think they might be getting 70 quid of hotel value and are duped into booking. Just after I checked out, I went for a pint at the pub on the corner, the Duke of Kendal. The barmaid asked where Iâ€™d been staying and we had a conversation about what a thoroughly crap time Iâ€™d had at the Griffin. â€œOh! I wonâ€™t recommend anyone stays there then...!â€� she said. And that too is why Iâ€™m writing this review. Just generally, if you get a bad vibe about a place when you arrive, ask to see the room *before* you pay anything. But more specifically, please save yourself the feeling of being ripped-off, abused and imprisoned in a basement and avoid the Griffin House Hotel. In short, I have three things to say about the Griffin House: 1. Do not stay at this hotel. 2. Do not stay at this hotel. 3. And do NOT stay at this hotel.Without a doubt, the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, outside of India. This hotel was not our first choice to stay during our recent pre-Christmas trip to New York - it wasn't even our tenth choice, due to the poor Tripadvisor ranking this place has received. I'd spent a long time trawling the net for a reasonably priced place to stay in a central location, but every hotel I was interested in was either fully booked, or extortionately priced. So, in the end, with misgivings, I booked the Edison, which still had vacancies in spite of its indisputably brilliant location. We had also noticed that every bad Tripadvisor review was followed by a flurry of excellent ones, posted by "new reviewers", who hadn't posted before, or since. If nothing else, the Edison has a well-developed "damage limitation department". I wish they devoted their energy to improving the hotel instead. Now, before you think I'm being a drama queen, please take a look at the pictures I took in the bathroom of room 1645. Eeeeeuwwww! If you like your reviews short, stop reading now, and just DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF! If you like your reviews detailed, here goes: We booked a double room for three nights, at a cost of $1,085.71 incl. of taxes. We flew in from Munich on a flight that took longer than usual, due to high winds over the Atlantic, and were pretty tired. It took over an hour to get through immigration. We took a cab from JFK to the Edison, where a fed up looking doorman dumped our cases on the busy pavement, and told us to wait. We decided to wheel our own instead, and made our way to reception. The first impression that greeted us was a strong smell of rancid frying fat. We identified the likely source of the reek as the Cafe Edison, which has an entrance just off the lobby as you walk in the door. We made our way to the reception desk, where two receptionists were busy in a private conversation, and ignored us completely for what seemed an age. Finally, in possession of our key cards, we headed for the lift. The public areas were festive and pleasant enough, if somewhat tired, with scuffed furnishings, and large rolls of new carpet being stored on the way to the entrance of the Italian Restaurant towards the back of the building. This was Friday - when we left on Monday the rolls of carpet were still there. Is there really no storage at all away from public view? It's not just about esthetics - why narrow the way to the back door, a potential escape in case of fire? Once we stepped out of the lift on our floor, our hearts sank. Scruffy corridor, patched up paint work, battered radiator covers, hideous institutional pinky-beige paint work, bad lighting, and the room was so vile we headed straight back down to reception. A young woman issued us with a new room key, and even managed to crack a smile when tipped. The second room was the same size and location, but on a higher floor, and the carpet was marginally less revolting. Had we been less exhausted, we'd have gone back down, hopefully "third time lucky", but frankly, we just wanted to get some sleep. Thus committed, we felt a bit, well, screwed, for the rest of our stay. We should have looked for somewhere else, but that's not how you want to spend precious holiday time, and we already knew the town was pretty booked. The room contained a standard double bed, with polyester sheets, lumpy foam pillows, and a very pronounced dip in the center of the mattress, that suggested a) this is usually allocated as a single room, b) the mattress is cheap and old. Gross! How many generations of tourists have sweated into this thing? Space was so limited that only one side of the bed had a bedside table. The rest of the furniture was old and scuffed - the sort of stuff that people abandon on the pavement when they move house. On the plus side, it was a dual aspect room with a window on each side, one overlooking the distant Hudson, which was nice. Also, the heater was powerful, and we were toasty in spite of the seasonal drop in temperature. The bathroom doesn't have a proper extractor, but a sort of "ventilation hole" with an ill-fitting grille. There was a shower curtain instead of a screen, which must lead to endless flooding and water penetration problems. I have documented the mould and mildew problem in the attached photographs. We had one breakfast in the Cafe Edison, pancakes and bacon, and French toast with bacon. The bacon was pre-cooked, cold and hard, the OJ cheap and synthetic tasting. Cheap white bread, one tiny plastic portion of milk per coffee - thankfully there's a Starbucks down on the next corner. We had one dinner in the Italian Restaurant downstairs. Split-level layout - we were seated at a tiny downstairs table by a totally fed-up greeter, in spite of the place being almost empty. This left us nose-level with the stinky carpet of the upper level. Two waiters kept whining within earshot about the shortcomings of the guy who brings the bread and water. The coat check lady was charming and smiley, other than that our impression was of serious staff dissatisfaction throughout the hotel. If the guest rooms are that depressing, what must the areas be like that are out of public view? I'd hate to work there, seriously. Apart from the hotel, we had a really super time in this gorgeous, exciting city, and enjoyed the sightseeing, wonderful helicopter flight with liberty helicopters, a fun Southern soul food dinner with yummy draught beer at "Delta", with super friendly staff and good music, which is in walking distance on 9th, good steak and wine at Capital Grille (also easily walkable), fantastic Christmas decorations everywhere, super views from the Rockefeller Center, amazing architecture, and the not-to-be-missed Grand Central Station. The Woolworth Building, omg, so stunning! The only other disappointment was the tatty sprawl that is Macy's. Please don't stay here, and ignore the "1 review" brigade that posts rave reviews. The only plus in this place is the location, if you need to be close to Times Square.Where do I even start?.. From the minute that we walked into The Marque Hotel, we were stunned by how much we had been deceived, based on the appearance and description of the hotel on its website. It is true that the hotel is somewhat centrally located in the southern region of Sydney; it is about a 15 minute walk from Darling Harbour, which has many shops and delicious restaurants, but it is located in the center of Chinatown, and if you are not interested in eating Asian food, you should expect to walk a good 15-20 minutes to either Darling Harbour. Our initial impression of the room was that it was a decent size and that it had the amenities that we were looking for. When we entered the room, it took us about 15 minutes to figure out how to even turn on a light; you must insert your room key into the wall in order to operate the lights and the air conditioner, but there are no directions whatsoever to explain to this to you. After our 22 hour trip from the US, all we wanted to do was take a shower. When we did, we were quickly alarmed with the noise that the shower was making. The website describes that each room has a rain shower, so we were excited to use it, but within a minute of doing so, the shower head was making a ridiculous noise that sounds similar to drilling. We brought this issue to the front desk, who offered to send up a maintenance worker. When we arrived at our room, he looked at the shower and after we told him to wait a minute or so while the water ran, he not only told us that were wasting water, but that the sound wasnâ€™t a problem. He said that it was most likely the sound of air exiting the shower head, and that it should go away within a minute or so. Let me tell you, we have been here for almost a week, and the sound has not only been a part of every shower that we have taken, but the water pressure and temperature changes along with the noise. The maintenance worker did not offer to come back if the sound persisted, and the front desk did not even bother to follow up with this issue. For a hotel that promises a â€œsoothingâ€� and â€œdivineâ€� rain shower experience, I feel as if I have been taking a shower in a thunderstorm for the past few days. If you are bringing important belongings (jewelry, passports, electronics), expect to be using a safe behind the front desk. There are no safes in the rooms, but they do offer personal safes at no cost if you wish to secure your items up front. The boxes are small though, so be aware that you can fit no more than a few small items within them. I am not sure how safe I actually feel putting my important personal items behind the reception desk, considering there have been multiple occasions in which we have been in the lobby where the desk was left unattended. The website states that the hotel offers Foxtel and Satellite television, and although that may be true, do not expect more than 3-6 channels. I must say though, I am happily surprised that the hotel offers free, 24 hour internet access, and that they provide an Ipod docking station and refrigerator for your convenience. On the other hand, there is no â€œpeep holeâ€� on the door, so we were not comfortable opening the door when hotel staff came to the room. We actually put our ironing board against the door at night because we were unsure of how well the door was locking since it wasnâ€™t a normal lock. If these issues werenâ€™t enough to turn you off from staying at this hotel, you will be unhappy to hear that the staff here is not only completely incompetent in providing solutions to any issues that are presented to them, but they have absolutely NO knowledge of anything within proximity to the hotel; they were unable to inform us of any restaurants, shops, excursions, etc. and there are limited brochures that are offered to guests when inquiring about things to do in the area. We eventually got fed up and booked the climb on our own within 5 minutes. We have had to go to multiple shops, restaurants, and even other hotels to ask about directions or suggestions on where to go. In my opinion, that is absolutely unacceptable to have to do when one is staying at a hotel that claims that they go â€œabove and beyondâ€� for their guests. When we tried to book our Bridge Climb excursion, one of the staff members did not know what the climb was, and he took about 45 minutes to try and book the excursion. We were going to confront the hotel staff at the end of our stay and discuss our unhappiness with our experience here, but after calling down for a bar of soap and being told that I had to go down myself and get it after 9pm, I had decided to express my concerns immediately. I was told that there is only one person at the desk and that any services that I needed after this time had to be taken care of on my own; I have never heard of this at a â€œfour-starâ€� hotel. As I walked downstairs to get my soap, a couple had walked in, looking for a room to stay in at the hotel. After they had been turned away due to full occupancy, they decided to linger in the lobby and discuss their other options. At this point, I decided to bring up to the staff how disappointed I have been so far with the hotel. Not only did the staff member not address any of our concerns or offer any guidance or solutions, but he rudely tried to dismiss the couple when they overheard our concerns and tried to help us solve our problems; he told them to leave and that he wasnâ€™t going to listen to them because they werenâ€™t staying at the hotel. This is an absolutely disgusting response from a person working in the hospitality industry. Little does he know that even though she isnâ€™t staying at the hotel, she is probably telling everyone she knows not to stay here. On day 4, we finally met the manager of the hotel and we expressed our issues and concerns and even told him that we were considering switching hotels. He apologized sincerely and gave us complimentary breakfast for the rest of our stay. Although he accommodated us, I would stay not stay here again, or recommend the hotel to others. Because we live in the US, we were not able to call the hotel before arriving and inquire about the amenities because of costly expenses due to international fees. Therefore, we strongly relied on The Marque website in making our decision to stay here. Do yourself a favor, and DO NOT stay here.i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices.We arrived end of Feb, a group of 11. The purpose of the trip was a friends wedding, I was her bridesmaid. We booked and flew with Thomson. The girls in the office were awful, total waste of time. We and the rest of the group will not be booking with them again. The premier upgrade on the flight is well worth the money! Especially if you enjoy your sleep. We were the only two who paid for this pleasure, the others just paid additional to pre book seats together. WASTE of time. they paid over 150 GBP between them to have allocated seats, as the married couple have a young baby and wanted him to be easily passed between grandparents etc during the 9 hr flight. They did not get the seats allocated on the return trip. The mother was told- on the return- this was because of the baby- he could not sit in window seats due to the fact there are only 2 air masks and he was being put at risk.. funny how no one mentioned this when they prebooked in the travel agents, or on the flight out???? They were split up evenly front and baack of the aircraft. Not really great service esp when your newly weds!!! mum was also told very rudely baby was to remain in his seat, she was not to walk up the aisle with him in her arms to get him off to sleep- she wasnt told this on the way out either!! The wedding itself- I would not get married abroad. Wedding at 4pm, meal was 6.45 and we were instructed to be out by 8pm. No special allowances! when asked what we may do between 4.30pm and 6.45pm the response was 'well, we could organize a cocktail party we suppose??' The flowers in the book to choose from look pretty rubbish- but on the day were nothing more than stunning. If you get married here, do not expect any special treatment! you literally get what u pay for. That is, if you get the wedding breakfast delivered to your room next morning.. which this couple didn't either! It was a very quick ceremony, not what you dream of! For anyone marrying here- the 'gardens' are the short grass area infornt of the breakfast patio- not a secret garden like you may think!! The funniest moment was an american chap shouting 'holy cow' at full volume as the bride and her father made their way up!!! his mouth was swinging open like he had never seen a wedding before! The rooms- well- they stink of damp and the drains stink. This smell will be on your clothes when you get home, allow some extra kgs flying out free- the water on your clothes will weigh your cases down!! 2 others in our party did move rooms, we decided not to, as the rooms they moved to were no better than before. top floor is supposedly better than ground... Keep your patio door open and turn the air con off- this actually smells worse... As for our couple getting wed here, thomson apparantly emailed asking for a room with a bath, to which they were told all rooms had baths. This was so they could bath the baby. They were prepared to pay for the upgraded room with a bath, but seeing as the 'normal' rooms had baths..they didnt.. No rooms had baths-unless you upgrade. They put the couple, the baby, the buggy and the luggage, cases, suits etc on the top floor. Mummy decided she was not carting baby 3 flights of stairs 4 times daily with buggy and all the gear. The top floor room allocated smelt so badly she didn't pass the threshold before she requested a ground floor room. Which was given, after almost forcing the staff! When she arrived in this room, no bath, and concrete wall outside her balcony door. Still smelt damp. Bride now in tears- no bath, damp room with 14month old baby. In the end, it required the rep to intervene. They did get an upgrade. but not without being told several times the 'hotel was full nothing else'. Room upgrade was nice- much better- but not worth the money in the thomson brochure. Okay, the food- available all day, good food. Staff generally are very nice. If you stay for 14 nghts you will crave something other than deep fried, pizza, chips, burger or hot dogs. be warned! The hotel itself is ok, not to the star rating in our opinion. The americans- this place is their Benidorm. They threw up in the stair wells, were staggering about drunk at 1pm, loud, rude, rowdy, overtook the pool, the bar, the works. They walk into you. They push past you, they stand next to your table at dinner having a 'chat'- no worry about your meal! the animacion team are all great lively guys, but the beach volleyball, pool games etc- its no relaxing break here. From our party we were all in different blocks, and every one of us had trouble with drunk Americans. One couple with us had them shouting 1-5 repeatedly until 3am where one was escorted away security. Another night they were banging on everyones doors demanding everyone wake up and party at early hours. We heard our neighbours drunkly discussing their body parts, whilst loudly procreating most nights early hours- enough to wake us up! They also broke street lights, uprooted bins generally ruined the place. Your rooms are cleaned daily, fresh towels etc no issues here. We had a video camera stolen during the wedding, but we are almost 100% this was a guest. The staff to us are 100% trustworthy. By the end of our stay we left out money etc in our rooms and it was always exactly were we left it. 5th avenue is great for shopping, eating etc. Do not buy jewels here, visit playa las americas in cancun we got our best diamonds there. You can wear your jewels, wallets etc no prob in playa del carmen. great place. We visited cozumel- had its day in our opinion. Cancun was very lively, almost a 'mini mock up of vegas' but not cheap. Chichen itza is a long day, but fantastic if you can do the trip- our tour guide victor was abs fantastic full of info etc. Cream up well, take a hat, and plenty of water of not provided. This place is like an oven. we swam with dolphins- our advice, take a 'non swimming' friend to film and photograph- 50 USD for a ten min DVD is pretty harsh! Haggle for everything. Best 'touristy' stuff we bought was at chichen itza- 4-5USD for most things. we bought two of the chess sets for 250pesos! We did not enjoy the hotel. Not relaxing unless you enjoy getting drunk on tequila everyday and spewing up, no worries about where you sleep! We would recc to anyone to go to the mayan palace (2006) its worth the extra money. Thi is only half of the tale too- We will not be returning to this hotel. A further tip- if you go to bed before 11pm- try get a room in block one or two- the music h=thumps VERY loudly if your at the pool end of block 5 and 6!! poor baby managed to sleep through it, just! If you want a poolside, get your towel down early on the clear days, beach side there were always places till at least 10.30am. Weather was reasonable, mix of sun and half cast days. Rained only once. we enjoyed mexico though, fantastic, we preferred this to St Lucia, and would prob return some day. Please excuse my spelling, half the keys are stuck due to some loon on the return flight throwing wine all over me!!!!!Stayed at Harrah's Feb 15-16th with my sister. Check-in seemed to go fine, we parked our car in their garage, hauled all our luggage up to our room and... the key card wouldn't work! Very annoyed we kept trying but had no luck. I walked down the hall towards the elevator and was getting ready to call the front desk when a bell boy came down the hall. I told him we had just checked in and our card wasn't working. He said 'aw man, I hope it's not the battery' checked our paperwork that showed the room we were in, used his card to let us in and told us to just let the front desk know our cards weren't working, they must not of been activated properly. So we proceded to get ourselves all settled in, unpacked some of our toiletries, used the restroom, and hung out for awhile looking at brochures and relaxing. We were in there probably 30 mins and decided it was time to 'hit the strip'. But first we need to stop by the desk and get our cards activated, no big deal right? WRONG!!! We told the man at the desk the situation and that our key wouldn't work and he asked to see my paperwork and ID which I gave to him, and he asked if the room was in my name and I said yes. He then took out this little purple strip of paper that was in the folder with the room key and asked if we knew the womans name that was on it. We said no and we had no idea what that paper was even for and I thought the womans name on it was the lady that checked me in. He explained that no it should of been my name on it and it was very strange but somehow when I checked in I was handed the wrong paper. That was why our key wouldn't work is because we were going to the wrong room. We explained that we went to the room we were told to go to and how were we to know any different! After asking us if we had been in the room long and if we had touched much and we said yes we had laid on the beds and used the restroom, he still made us move to a different room! He said he was sorry but the room we went to was registered to the lady who's name was on the paperwork and we were supposed to be in room xxx so we were going to have to move! Not only that but because it was a 'security issue' security would have to open the room for us and we had to identify our luggage before we could get it. So he called security and told them to meet us up there, gave us corrct paperwork, apologized again, etc. We hurried back up to our original room assuming security would already be there, but no one was in sight. By now our patience was extremely thin and I found it inexcuseable to have to wait for security, I picked up the house phone in the hall and angrily explained the situation and was put on hold, then security finally decided to saunter on up so I hung up. Security proceeded to watch our every move while we gathered our belongings making us feel practically like criminals. The one guy thought it was very weird we had to move to another room and told us to talk to the manager cause it wasn't right how we were treated. We agreed so we did stop by the managers desk where he apologized and comped our first night's stay. Now all that would of been good and fine if the rest of our stay had gone well, the one night free did go a long way towards making up for all our aggravation although it still stunk to start our night off with such a bad start. However we continued to have a bad experience at this hotel! The first morning there we had just got up and my sister was taking a shower when suddenly this very loud, obnoxious alarm goes off. I called the front desk and told them there was this hideous alarm going off and she asked if we were smoking and I said no and she said she'd look into it. Then we opened the door and there was a maid in the room across from us and she said everything is fine it's nothing to worry about. Ok well that's good to know, however it still took them a good 10 minutes to turn the blasted thing off, it was horrible! Later that day we came back to our room in the afternoon to relax for a little while and I went to get some ice to drink ice water and their ice machine was broken! It may seem like a minor thing but it was just one more irritation. Then to top it all off you would expect after such a bad stay to at least get good cutoomer service while checking out, but oh no not at Harrah's! I was all prepared to compain about everything that went wrong but when the woman checking us out asked how our stay was and I replied 'not very good' she just said 'oh, not very good huh'. I couldn't believe it! A normal response would of been oh I'm so sorry what was the problem? not 'oh not very good'! Then when I got my receipt I couldn't tell what had been charged to my card so I said 'can I get a total on here' and she snapped at me 'it's right there plain as day!' Well no, it was not! It had a charge with a minus sign, a room charge, the buffet we ate at Rio and then another charge with a minus sign. At the bottom where it said total it said zero. There was no total on the bill! I wanted to make darn sure the bill was correct and our one night had been comped so I went over to the manager again but he was busy with another customer. So finally another guy asked if he could help us and he explained our bill but when I said the lady checking us out had been rude he didn't respond so we just got the heck out of there! I honestly have never had such a bad experience at a hotel in my life and even if I was offered a free stay there I would hesitate to return!If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$$ this is the place to be!!''I don't think I have ever been quite so unhappy staying anywhere in the world. One of the highlights of the stay (If you ever get to room 742) was to play the krypton factor...Using only your balance and the squares on the carpet, try to get from the door to the bathroom without making the floor squeak. I say it's impossible but maybe you have to think outside the box and use the area under the bed - but I think that's cheating... The rest of the inhabitants on the 7th floor were marauding teenagers and by day two, the hotel decided it was easier to mover me rather than protect what little of their hotel remained. I did make a point of saying I didn't want a bigger or a better room or anything â€“ I hadn't paid for one and all I wanted was a quieter space... They could have got this so right but in the end they made such a big issue about my being given a club room and it was one of the best rooms in the hotel etc. etc...but before they would swap keys they had to take another imprint of my cc as they couldn't trust me not to nick anything from the mini bar - and then put me in 420 next to the lift shaft â€“ I ask you! Originally they said my new room would be ready at midday but that wasn't the case when I returned in the afternoon, but don't get too excited â€“ its just a paint job and a new telly â€“ every thing else reused from old rooms and if they look behind the room door there is some ones old shower cap. So anyway, they've turned me into a 'rant' - they won't or can't control their guests and in the meantime, I get punished twice and get charged Â£270 for the privilege. You cant play the krypton factor in room 420 as they have swapped the squares for lines - which is fiendishly difficult. On day two at 4 am (17.02) the fire alarm went off and we all went outside to watch the fire engine. No one was on duty to shepherd the people at the back of the hotel â€“ very confusing and only one bloke on the front who shouted 'Gpherrede yeahahy mellodonnnehkay' down the loud speaker before disappearing and we all went back to bed except for the teenagers of course... At least the fire klaxon did work. I did wonder about that as 742 and 420 both have 'stepped' ceilings and I thought that all ceiling areas were supposed to be covered independently? But they are not. I took a picture to show the fire officer just in case. Later that same morning we were offered neither apology or explanation, was that the 'Gpherrede yeahahy mellodonnnehkay' ? Just the prospect of another wait behind a 20 deep queue for breakfast in a half full room. Hotel is on record as being very proud of its international staff but I can assure you that all messages are translated and re translated several times before you get an answer. I think they should multi-train the chattering receptionists or several concierge staff to go and manage the breakfast queues when they get busy. The true highlight of my stay was finding the Cafe Concerto for Breakfast. This is 100 yards from the hotel on High Street Ken. There, you are treated to a warm welcome, a smiley helpful team who provide excellent service and a great breakfast. That was a real find after the debacle of 3 nights at Kensington chase. It looks like all the rooms are quite small (Probably due to space and business rates.?) so if you are going with a friend, make sure it is some one you have a habit of bumping into, or someone that you would like to bump into, as this would be inevitable. Internet on 7th floor is non existent but they are happy enough to charge you up to Â£15 for a days access. Outrageous â€“ go and get yourselves a booster and a deal with Orange! Internet access costs diddly squit these days. They did give me my money back but was asked to sign a form saying they were giving me money, although they don't give you a signed for saying you had paid them in the first place! I'm not interested in their internal accounting practices â€“ I just wanted my money back for something that didn't work â€“ simple. They debit your card for the room before arrival too. On hotel web site it proudly boats '4 star hotel' but this is a self assessment (not explained) and they are mistaken. I would urge every one to check and make sure they are staying in a place where the hotel has invested in a worthwhile scheme and not rely on self judgement as this can be very misleading and lead to disappointment. In a couple of years, London will host the Olympics and we stand to be the tourism laughing stock of the world if these places don't get their act together. If you want to go and stay at the Kensington Close then do so, but please arrive with little or no expectations and all your wishes will be fulfilled. I have stayed in many other guest houses and hotels that stand head and shoulders above this place in levels of comfort and service. London is my favourite city and personally, I have never been so pleased to leave a hotel. They charged me Â£90.00 quid in advance for each night, single occupancy, ruined a short break, and for Â£270 pounds in 2009 - we all deserve so much better'' I ent a copy of my review as i thought that the mgt deserved at least the right to reply - their sales coordinator wanted to know more details so on 19 February, 2009 19:06:46 I sent e-mail to Manoj Dudhe who hasn't bothered to reply. (i have a read receipt) I hope they have fun spending my Â£270.00 - it certainly isn't on customer service - stay away at all counts.First, I do not condone underage drinking. That being said, I know that no matter how much we speak to our teenagers, they usually do drink when down for senior week. Someone pointed out these reviews before our kids went to the beach for senior week. I called ECM because I was very concerned about "security" entering rooms without anyone home, coming in the condos in the middle of the night, claims made against the kids by "security" family members who happen to live in the building or stay there and what appeared to amount to spying on our kids, etc. I was assured that this wasnt the case, they were a family friendly condo, kids were welcome, but only if they were well behaved, not making noise, not caught with alcohol, drugs, etc.,that everything would be fine. What she didnt say was that "security" would "check-up", (spy) on our children all day and night. According to "security", someone "spotted" an underage person drinking a beer when the curtians moved away from the patio window after someone shut the front door. One, not sure how they could KNOW this person was underage and two, why were they peering in the slider window when the kids had not been loud or doing anything to require a closer look? When they, "security" came in, they dont approach the person they eventually said they saw drinking, but asked how old the first man they encounter was. When he replied he was 21 and the second man said he was 20, one of the "security" guards then says, "oh, it was that one then..." pointing to the one who was underage. As it turned out, the kids did have a case of beer and a number of bottles of alcohol. "Security" asked for all alcohol to be placed on counter, checked around for more, took a photo of it and then had them pour it out. The "security" even remarked how well behaved they had been until they spotted the "underage drinker" through the gap in the curtians, that they had been coming by 5-6 times a night and hadnt seen or heard anything negative. Although I am no legal expert, renters, even teenagers do have an expectation of privacy. Peering in windows without any complaints or evidence of wrong doing should be illegal. When I came down the next morning, I was told by the kids they had until 9am to be out and coincidentally, the office didnt open until 9am. I tried to reach management and was told my issue wasnt an emergency and would have to wait until they opened. I finally get someone to answer the phone and tell them I am at the condo, wanted to find out what could be done to allow kids to stay (I am one of the parents, by the way), etc and am told they would have to contact someone else and they would call me back. A woman with ECM does call with a very rude, nasty older man on the phone at the same time. I assumed he was "security". Although he did give me his name, he never gave me his position. When I pointed out that I didnt appreciate his being nasty or rude to me, that I wasnt a teenager to be pushed around, he basically says he didnt have an attitude, but could get one with me "real quick" if I wanted. I will assume this is the same intimidation tact he employs with our kids. He goes on to tell me that there was no way the kids would be allowed to stay after being "caught" with alcohol. (When I called prior to them going down, the ECM person I spoke with me assured me that if their was an incident, that they didnt automatically get evicted. She said it would depend on how "respectful" the kids were to security, their behavior prior to any infraction, etc.) The conversation turns to if they, meaning ECM doesnt want teenagers staying there, they shouldnt rent to them. He says that they, ECM, dont do the renting and they, all the places in OC, have no choice but to rent to anyone over 18 or risk being fined. I am an adult. I can appreciate the position ECM could be put in if something were to happen on their property because of underage drinking, but this is a risk they take with adults that drink also. They arent peering into their windows, "checking-up" on them, by their own admission, 5-6 times a night, and not pushing their way in to see IF anyone is drinking underage. If I rent a place, can they come in because I have a teenager and I, a legal adult, am having a drink????? While disappointed in our kids for the alcohol, I believe this company hires "security" to actively spy on our kids in order to "catch" them doing something. Just because our kids ended up having an infraction, doesnt mean the manner in which is was discovered is right or legal. I find it more than a little unnerving that these men, no matter what their job, were peering in the windows of a condo at our kids, a condo they were legally renting. We know of 9 other "groups" that were kicked out this week. Thats $4500. Oh, by the way, we know this because the security guards bragged about that fact. They bragged about encountering 3 naked girls the day before, one of which a security guard gave his jacket to, the amounts of alcohol they have seen and had poured out in the last few days, etc. Aside from all of this, the place was dank and smelled very bad. Am having to wash everything I able to throw in the washer to get the smell out of my kids belongings. I actually rented a place personally for a long weekend at the time we booked this in another of ECM's buildings. It was filthy, smelled like cat urine and like someone smoked 1000 ciggerettes and closed the place up with all the smoke still in there. Their answer to this problem was that the, "...carpets kind of smelled like cat urine because they may have been damp...", and they brought some sort of machine that was suppose to get rid of the stench. This is a terrible company to do business with. Stay clear. Dont care how many reviews say it isnt that bad. I've had two bad experiences in the past 3 months. The problems arent a fluke.I stayed for 2 days in January to attend a conference (I'm an attorney). I brought along two t-shirts - one to sleep in, one to work out in. It was chilly in the room the last evening so I wore both. One was an extra soft "Life is Good" shirt my hubby got me on a trip and the other was a shirt the Obama campaign gave us in return for a donation. On Jan 30, I checked out early (around 8:30 am) to get to my conference. I packed my belongings - my two shirts in a shopping bag. Big mistake. I picked up my two bags in the afternoon and dropped them off at a nearby hotel (my husband was joining me that evening for a weekend in NY). Around 7 pm, I am unpacking and can't find my two tees. I think - well, maybe I left them in the room (although I'm 95% sure I did not as I travel alot for business and pleasure and I'm good about triple checking my room before I depart). Anyway, I run across the street - I see security. They take me to the room (which was cleaned but unoccupied). Nothing there. Nobody returned the shirts to the Lost & Found. I check the baggage check area - where I paid $3.50 for the day, presumably to keep my bags secure. No response. So they ask me to fill out a report, slip me a number to call "Mike in security" during the week to check with him to see if the shirts turn up. I do so the next week. Mike basically tells me he has "no idea" why they told me to call him. Really? A guest has items missing from either the room or the baggage area and SECURITY has "no idea" why I'm calling? Especially galling since SECURITY gave me "Mike's" number in the first place. I explain this to Mike. I also ask for the name of the Manager of the hotel, as I think maybe he should know about this. He tells me: "I can tell you right now that he isn't going to care. He'll refer you right back to us [SECURITY]." Then he says "oh, the baggage claim is not Hilton - it's a third party contractor." I replied, "Nice try, but it is the hotel's responsibility and at the end of the day, the hotel should know if any thefts are occurring on its premises." I also mentioned that on THursday, January 29, I was rudely treated by the maid on my floor Sophia. Here's what happened - I went back for my lunch break and went into my room to watch television. My remote control was gone. Since my room was clean and I had seen Sophia down the hall, I walked up, said "excuse me, I'm staying in room such and such, where is my remote?" She didn't respond. She waved me away. I asked again. She pointed down the LOOOONG hall: "Go ask her." And she turned away. So I walked down to the other end of the hall and ask this poor woman, whose name, unfortunately, I didn't get because it seemed she actually cared about doing a decent job and treating guests with respect. She said "Sophia cleaned your room -- Hold on, I'll find out..." she walked with my down the hall and asked Sophia about it. Sophia, annoyed, said "what? what are you talking about." This poor woman said "her TV REMOTE! You cleaned her room! Do you have it?" Of course, Sophia did - she had taken it from my room for some reason and put it in another and couldn't be bothered to answer my question. So of course I thought, well IF I did forget and leave my two tees in the room, maybe the oh-so-helpful Sophia would "forget" that she saw the tees although why someone would steal two tees I'll never know. So I mentioned this to "Mike." No effect. A week later, I get a call from a David H. in security asking me to call him. I think - wow, maybe they found them in the laundry or something - that's great. I call back. Nope. David wants to know whether I have receipts for the tees. I was flabbergasted. Now I have to prove that I had them? I have time to make up stories about two tees not worth more than $30? I explained to him that the one tee I got on a trip to MD with my hubby in October 2007 - so, uh, no I wouldn't have a receipt for that. As for my Obama tee - it was a gift from the campaign so in a way it is priceless. I explained that to this guy and then asked why - and he said "well, we need to know what they were worth IN CASE WE'RE LIABLE." Um, ok. I still plan to contact the hotel management. That was the most ridiculous, aggravating and downright obnoxious experience I have EVER had at a hotel. Like I said, I travel alot for business and pleasure and I have never had something go missing. I also felt like the so-called SECURITY Team was completely uninterested in my plight. I mean, I did say - yea, I get it, they're just two t-shirts, no big deal, but they are MY t-shirts and I like them both. I'd like to recover them. The whole thing left a bitter taste. Terrible hotel. Terrible service. Terrible follow up. Stay at the Warwick or the London. Hilton has gone down the hill. I will never stay at a Hilton, anywhere, ever again.Marlin Travel Northgate Shopping Mall Edmonton, Alberta Jan 31/11 RE: COMPLAINT FOR INCLUSIVE HOLIDAY JANUARY 23/11 - JANUARY 31/11 We went to Marlin Travel and met with an agent there to whom we emphatically explained that due to health reasons we did not want a trip where there was lots of walking. The agent assured us that this was a beautiful location and everything was close by, they even had carts to pick you up and transport you to your destination within the resort, and the ocean was very accessible. She was not sure about the tours, so we would have to check when we got there. The agent mentioned that she had a colleague that had just come back from the Blue Bay Resort and had found it very beautiful, and that we would love it there. NOT SO! We were also told that our Sunwing representative would greet us at the airport and show us which bus to catch to the resort. NOT SO! We also complained to our Sunwing rep about our room and the problems with the elevator but he just brushed us off and made it sound like it was no big deal. Our Sunwing rep told us to go see him on Saturday Jan 29/11 and he would tell us what time to be in the front lobby to leave for the airport on Sunday. We went to see him on Saturday but he was not there. So we checked back again later and he still did not arrive. We actually HAD TO GET ANOTHER REP FROM A DIFFERENT COMPANY to help us find the information. NOT GOOD SERVICE!!! -When we arrived on Sunday Jan. 23/11 at the front desk the minute we stepped off the bus the overwhelming smell of sewage assaulted us. It was like this for five days out of the seven we were there. Some days it was so bad that we could not open the patio door in the room. A large amount of the resort smelled this way. We were shuttled to our room on the cart where we found that the elevator button for the fourth floor was broken and that my husband who has congestive heart failure had to run up the stairs and push the button for the elevator before it could go to the 4th floor because I can't walk up stairs. We told the guy that brought us to our room that this would be a problem and he said that it would be fixed on Monday. NOT SO! We also reported the broken button on the elevator to the front desk, to the concierge, and to the rep from Sunwing. We were told that they were waiting for parts on Wednesday and it would be fixed NOT SO! It had not been fixed for the whole time we were there, nor did they offer to change our room or anything else. The patio door was not working properly and we had to slam the door to be able to lock it. When we asked how often the carts go around we were told every ten minutes NOT SO!. I sat outside waiting for a cart for half an hour to forty five minutes and not one cart came around. I then called the front desk and they said they would send someone who never showed up. And when we saw carts going around and wanted to go back to our building we were told that they could not take us as they were not going that way or that they had to drop us off at the swimming pool and we would have to walk the rest of the way to our building. If we tried to flag a cart down the driver would say NO then continue to drive away. There were times that I called the front desk and someone didn’t show up and the more we tried to explain the reason why we needed the cart the worse the service got. By Wednesday we had had enough and were ready to go home early!!!!!!!! The reasons why we needed the carts: the main buffet was a block to a block and a half away, the sports bar was a block to a block and a half away, the lobby was a block and a half to two blocks away UPHILL!!, the ocean was half a mile away from our building. At this point does anyone remember that we have health issues, and that we would need transportation to get to these locations???? -Eric was the best driver for the carts and was very courteous to the patrons, he did his job very well. Eric also looked out for patrons when he knew they were having problems. -the food in the Buffet was excellent and we really enjoyed the variety of foods prepared, whoever cooked the salmon and fish did an excellent job as it was so tasty, however when I tried to take 3 small buns with ham and cheese to our room one of the supervisiors came up to us as we were leaving and said that we could not take food to our room. When we explained that I needed to have some food to take my medications he said he didn’t care and that we can’t do that - its company policy. Also the Mexican dinner theatre at the sports bar was terrible. The food was gross, way too much salt in the soup, the meat was raw, and the waiters did not speak a word of English or acknowledge us when we tried to complain about the meal. I was very surprised at the conditions at the resort (smell and terrible cart service) and that they have no sense of what their clientele’s needs are and are totally oblivious to the needs of the aging population: eg. NO WALKER’S, WHEELCHAIRS, CARTS TO TRANSPORT INJURED CLIENTS (one woman broke her ankle while on a tour) or people with legs or hips problems considering the spread out area of the resort. They have not made concessions for people who are on specialized medications in regards to food with medications).Their actions and attitude shows that they do not care about their clientele and are only concerned with getting the money for their booking, flight and stay. WE REALLY FEEL THAT AFTER WAITING 29 YEARS TO GO ON OUR HONEYMOON WE DID NOT RECEIVE A GOOD HOLIDAY. WE REALLY FEEL DISGRUNTLED IN THE TREATMENT WE RECEIVED AT THE BLUE BAY RESORT, THE NON-CHALANT ATTITUDE OF THE SUNWING REP, MARLIN TRAVEL’S MISINFORMATION AND WILL NOT BE REFERRING OTHERS TO ANY OF THE ABOVE THREE. I sincerely hope that in the future you check out more thoroughly the resorts and airlines or travel agents that you do business with. Mr. and Mrs. Verbonac Cc: Sunwing and Blue Bay Resorts -We stayed in this room from April 15-17 for our 15th anniversary. We did so using a F&F voucher from a good friend who is management at a Ritz Carlton a couple of hours from where we live. Wish we'd have just went to his hotel instead! Even making reservations weeks in advance of our date, and calling the hotel separately to let them know it was a 15th anniversary, when we arrived any hopes of a romantic "beachside" vacation were soon dashed. A few comments down a poster mentions "If not for the name 'beachside', I would have had no idea this place was near the water". Truer words were never spoken! This is truly a tale of two hotels. If you book here, get it in blood that you will have a water-view room. We just assumed that like most hotels, no matter what your actual view, if you strain you'll eventually see water. What did we see from our window? In the first room we saw a covered walkway about 3-feet across - and directly in front of that, as far as you could see 8-10 feet in either direction was more stucco. No natural sunlight whatsoever. The room was tiny and depressing. Even the "happy anniversary" card and Godiva chocolates waiting on the night table could not bring a smile to our face. We started to look around for a mini-fridge -- we live in Florida -- we expect mini-fridges on our beach vacation to be standard (especially at a hotel of this price). Nothing. After an 8+ hour drive to the Keys we were thirsty and tired, so my husband set off to find a Coke machine. Guess what? No Coke machine. He ended up going through buildings and the pool area and eventually to the main lobby before he found anything to drink. I thought at one point that I might never see him again. While he was gone, because I'm paranoid about bed bugs, I lifted back the sheets and fitted sheet. I didn't find bed bugs but I found hair all over the mattress cover and fitted sheet. GROSS! We were not in a "make due" situation here. Even at a F&F rate we were spending hundreds of dollars (pre-paid) and it was our FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY. My husband finally got back in the room with our Cokes, exhausted, only to find out I wasn't about to sleep on that bed. So he called the front desk to complain not only about the hair -- but the room size, view, and the fact we were spending our anniversary like this. We were told they were booked up and we'd be getting transferred to the same room. A bellhop would be right over with keys. Whatever. A HALF-HOUR later my husband called back to the front desk. We had watched the entire Nightly News cast and had yet to receive replacement keys. We didn't exactly want to hang out in a hairy room. They finally showed up about 10 minutes later and moved us to another room. Again, no mini-fridge. Great. We got everything situated, assured ourselves this bed was clean, and my husband called the front desk to ask where to find ice. We were told there are no ice machines here -- the bellhop will bring you a bag. Guess how long we waited for that? At least another half-hour. So far this was not the relaxing vacation we had envisioned. It was a true pain in the ____. But we were learning that was only part of what was to come. The way these "suites" are constructed, there is one large suite (not the one we had) with a pool or water view. The remaining "suites" and closets are stacked side-by-side dorm room style -- all sharing a main breezeway. Our breezeway had two rooms (A & B) and two closets. The main door to the outside of this breezeway is extremely heavy and slams when the pressure changes. So any time you or your suite-mates (even if you have no idea who they are, as was our case) leaves the breezeway -- the main door slams, shakes the entire set of doors inside the breezeway, and it is impossible to sleep through. Then you have to deal with your suite-mate's door closing as well. And if they have maid-service, but you choose to sleep in -- too bad. Because with the breezeway situation the maid's cart might as well be in your room with the noise and door slamming. Somehow we survived our first night though and decided to reward ourselves with breakfast in bed the next morning. The little card was supposed to be hanging on the door by midnight and we had it out at 10 p.m. Forty-five minutes late the next morning we received a call that they had lost our order and just found the card at the front desk. They rushed the food up to our room because my husband was not exactly nice about it at this point. It tasted rushed. It was horrible. And on top of that, we are not coffee drinkers -- we drink Coke in the mornings. That is what we ordered. They brought up two room temp cans of Coke and two glasses -- but no ice. Our ice from the night before had already melted. So we had to call the front desk again just to get ice for our late breakfast. Another 20 minute wait. As mentioned by countless others, there is no real "beach" here (just rocks and water) and it's a bit of a drive to the main attractions in Key West. These things we could have overlooked if we'd had a nice room with a decent view and felt like we could have relaxed. But to open our window and simply get natural light in the first room would have been impossible. In the second room, we'd only have a view of tourists schlepping their luggage by or going to and from the pool. We had planned to hit the pool bar our second night there and didn't even bother based on the amount of money we'd already spent and the type of treatment we'd received from the staff. I've noticed that managers come in and comment on some of these reviews after the fact to "gloss it over", and they're more than welcome to do so with this post. However, I was sending live e-mails to the friend who helped us get this reservation as this was all occurring so this is not just sour grapes after the fact. We were miserable on the vacation, and depressed to be back home thinking our fifteenth anniversary was so important to this resort they couldn't even bother to give us a clean bed -- much less a view of that Beachside they're so proud to flaunt in their name. If you choose to stay here and get the larger suite in your breezeway, by all means feel lucky. If you get the rooms we had, my sincerest condolences. I wish I'd listened to reviews like mine in advance and went elsewhere! And we didn't even pay full-price! (P.S. It's $17.50 / night to park at this hotel.)I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE FOOD.After I paid for my purchase, I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my pie.Horrible If you want to be able to roll out the door onto the doorstep of the Disneyland Paris parks then this hotel is ideal, but to be honest that鈥檚 about all it鈥檚 got going for it, and frankly that鈥檚 not much of an advantage given that most of the other hotels are within walking distance anyway.Disney position this hotel as the ultimate in luxury, which is like saying that choosing a salad instead of a burger at one of the Disneyland restaurants is healthy eating. Everything is relative I guess, but if this hotel is truly Disney鈥檚 ultimate then I鈥檓 scared of what I鈥檒l find at their other hotels. If you鈥檝e had the Orlando experience then you鈥檒l recognize this hotel as a scaled-down version of the Grand Floridian, with many of the same flaws repeated. If you鈥檝e never been to Disney World, then think Holiday Inn (in terms of room and food quality) meets old age home (in terms of d茅cor and the smell of the awful air freshener that they seem to use everywhere) meets train station (in terms of the huge volume of people constantly streaming through the common areas at busy times).For the most part the hotel鈥檚 general facilities are okay, but there are some perplexing inadequacies. In this day and age it鈥檚 inexcusable for a supposedly up-scale hotel to lack in-room wi-fi (and to then charge you EUR4.50 per hour to use it in the common areas). Ditto the lack of a basic convenience store for newspapers, toiletries, etc (does Disney have some sort of general policy limiting the sale of anything that doesn鈥檛 have their logo on it? If not can they please starting selling Goofy-branded shaving foam) 鈥?for a reliable supply of these you have to walk to the nearby train station. We found the pool area disappointing, especially the fact that it was indoors only. A big negative for us was that the hotel wasn鈥檛 more than superficially clean 鈥?we pulled back the curtains in the lift lobby on our floor to look out the window and found dust and grime everywhere. The fact that our room was cleaned in less than 15 minutes on most of the days that we were there also speaks volumes in this regard (certainly there would not have been time to vacuum the carpet in just 15 minutes).Our overall experience was definitely disappointing. French flair was notable only in its absence, as Disney appears to have done little more than translate the L.A. / Orlando operations manuals into French. The most obvious result of this was that our na茂ve hopes that the food would be better than in Orlando were hopelessly dashed at the first and every subsequent nibble.The service is patchy (most staff do try, but the overall impression is that unlike in Orlando the staff just haven鈥檛 assimilated into Disney鈥檚 culture of perpetual but disconcertingly surreal happiness) while the food is either expensive and awful (both in terms of flavour and healthiness) or acceptable but extortionately priced.The main buffet restaurant is named (apparently without any culinary irony) Inventions and for breakfast serves standard fare of mediocre quality. Fresh fruit was notable by its absence (limited largely to over-ripe bananas, dry oranges and floury apples, or otherwise heavily sugared fruit salad) and eggs came in only one variety (scrambled). After two shaky breakfast experiences we were frankly too scared to try it for dinner or lunch.The California Grill attempts to be more up-market and charges accordingly, but it falls very far short. Dinner for 2 adults and 2 children will cost you EUR160-180 (excluding alcohol) for a meal that would be over-priced at half that much. By way of comparison, our meals at La Veranda (Gordon Ramsey鈥檚 brasserie at Versailles) and at Kong and Alcazar in Paris all cost the same or less and were all immeasurably better value for money. On the plus side the service at The California Grill was reasonably good (the staff were well-trained and attentive) and at least real vegetables (i.e., something other than french fries) were on the menu for our children. Of course, the less said about the Disney park food the better - it's truly horrendous (and, as others have also noted, very expensive). Don't eat in the parks unless you're at death's door - and even then the experience may hasten your demise. All you get is fat and sugar in equally excessive quantities, with a few token attempts at salad thrown in here and there. Admittedly we didn鈥檛 try every 鈥渞estaurant鈥?in the park, but nonetheless The Backlot Express at Disney Studios was the only place where we found a half decent salad (pre-made of course, and 80% lettuce with a few token tomatoes and olives), but otherwise everything else in Disneyland or Disney Studios was truly, truly ghastly. It鈥檚 indeed telling that the culinary highlight of the Disney parks is The Gibson Girl on Main Street USA where the main offering is 12 flavours of Ben and Jerry鈥檚. FWIW, in a desperate attempt to find better food we gave Mickey鈥檚 Caf茅 in the Disney Village a chance and at least got table service with salads on the menu, the result of which was something that was at least fresher than the prepackaged stuff inside the parks but which nonetheless completely lacked imagination and consisted of little more than iceberg lettuce leaves.TBH we tolerated the above purely for the sake of our kids, who were naturally in awe of the rides and the characters in costume (not to mention the copious opportunities for toy shopping). By the third day however we had lost our ability to take one for the team, and took an excursion to La Vallee Village, the nearby brand-name outlet mall. This was a very pleasant surprise, not so much for the shopping (which was okay but not great), but rather for the discovery of Bert鈥檚 Caf茅 Contemporain, which offered a great range of fresh sandwiches, pastries, salads, cereals, yoghurts, etc, and which thus provided dinner that night and breakfast the next day as well on our way to Versailles.Clearly it was na茂ve of us to expect an experience much different from Disney World. The rides are as good as the American originals and (despite the apparent cultural aversion most European nationalities have to orderly queuing) Disneyland Paris is almost as well run as its U.S. counterpart so thankfully we (and most importantly our kids) had a good time outside of mealtimes, but it鈥檚 nonetheless a real shame that Disney can鈥檛 move beyond abysmally prepared fast-food, even in the gastronomic capital of the world.In summary: don鈥檛 pay the extra money for the Disneyland Hotel unless you鈥檙e physically unable to walk the extra kilometer or so from the other Disney hotels. In all likelihood the experience will be equally ghastly at all of the Disney properties, so you might as well pay as little as possible. And take your own food.We recently stayed at this hotel (8/12/06 Room 712) in a king TCB suite and had a terrible experience. 2 adults and 1 6yr old boy. After reading some mixed reviews of this hotel, I called ahead to express some of my concerns regarding bedding, etc. Debbie, who took my call and greeted me when we arrived later that evening, was absolutely wonderful. I explained to her that I had serious problems with my spine and absolutely had to have a good mattress (no springs, good padding, etc). She told me the manager would be checking on the mattress and there would be sheets, blanket and pillows for the sofa as I requested. We checked in after 7pm. At first glance, the room was wonderful for the price we paid ($62 a night AAA Discount). We were actually considering making this a regular place to stay. The first thing we checked was that the sheets were there for the sofabed. They were not. There also was about a 1/4 roll of toilet paper and no extra pillows. My boyfriend headed down to the front desk and requested the sheets, extra pillows and a roll of tp (Once again, Debbie was great). We then headed out to Universal to catch the last night of the 360 Cinesphere, dinner and a movie (we're passholders). It was my boyfriends birthday. When we returned and settled into our room, the bad experience began. First, the room smelled musty but better than the hallway. We made the sofa bed for my 6 yr old son. It was so uncomfortable, he begged to sleep with us. So we tried puting the mattress on the floor for him. At that point we realized it wasn't the bars on the sofabed it was the mattress itself. Upon turning the sheets down on the king bed, I realized that I could feel all the springs with my hand on the edge of the mattress. When I got into the bed, there was a spring poking me in my ribs and upon looking up there was a huge water stain on the ceiling (hence the musty smell) between the bed and work area. We all slept in some strange positions that night. The toilet ran all night long, but with the door closed and the ac running you could barely hear it. This was kind of ironic considering, the water pressure wouldn't even flush a piece of toilet paper without flushing 3 times. Needless to say we were not very well rested in the morning. I called the front desk in the a.m. for a late 2 pm check out as a Hyatt Gold member. We had intended on spending the day enjoying the pool (we never did use the pool, but it looked clean and the people in it said it was nice ). The person who was at the front desk that morning could use a good lesson in customer service. She told me, "You can have the room until 1 pm, but if we need it, you'll have to clear out." I couldn't believe my ears. What kind of answer is that? We decided to get ourselves together and check out. There were 2 towels for 3 people and eventhough there was a housekeeping cart on our floor, the housekeeper was nowhere to be found for at least 2 hours. So showers for everyone were out of the question. My boyfriend and son got to shower. I called and requested a towel that never came. Then came the straw that broke the camels back so to speak. My boyfriend went in to use the bathroom and the toilet overflowed. I called the front desk immediately to inform them maintenance was needed desperately as the toilet was overflowing and I had to go to the bathroom. The front desk clerk asked me if it was overlfowing onto the floor and I replied no because I had shut off the water to the tank but it was right up to the top of the bowl and I had to go badly and didn't want to leave maintenance a "present" if you get my drift. I was assured someone would be up immediately. Fourty five minutes later, no maintenance, no towel, no shower, no toilet and I was humiliated to have to go the bathroom (poop) in a toilet that what up to the rim with waste water splashing on me but could not hold it not another second. We did see the housekeeper on the way out. He was getting a plunger from a utility room right next to ours and knocking on the wrong door. I could not have been more embarrassed or wanted to leave this hotel faster. When I got to the front desk, I was asked if everything on my bill was correct. I explained that we did not use the safe and the other issues we had with the room. The clerks response was "Sorry." That's it, just sorry. I informed her that I was very upset that I had to go home without a shower and had to poop in an overlfowing toilet. I was absolutely mortified!! Again she repeated "Sorry." I told her at that point that we won't be staying here again and I'll e-mail management about my problems since she didn't seem to give a hoot. She basically looked at me blankly and said nothing. We never got to check out the free breakfast or the pool. At this point, I just wanted to get home and take care of my hygene. Other minor things are, there was only one waste basket in the room, one in the bathroom and no liners. Keep in mind this room has a small kitchenette, seperate living, sleeping and work areas. The curtains are cut short so the ac blows behind the curtains instead of into the room and daylight floods the room at the crack of dawn. We used the deskpad from the work area on top of the ac and leaned it into the window on top of the curtains so air would blow into the room instead of between the window and the curtain. The carpet had several large white stains at the foot of the bed. We never did figure out what it was, we just side stepped that area. The refrigerator didn't keep anything cold, but the room temperature bottled water in your room was a nice touch. When we first got there I couldn't understand what all the bad reviews were about. I felt like we had found a hidden gem right across from Universal and decently priced for the area. After an overnight stay, I get what the bad reviews are about. I would not recommend this hotel.After waiting for almost an hour, the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order.Carlsberg don't do hotels but if they did ... this would be the farthest thing from it. OK, before I begin what is most definitely going to become a "rant" I should mention the one good thing about the Hotel Carter. That would be its location; it’s in a fantastic place close to Times Square, the bus terminal and a short stroll to 5th Avenue. Ok, now for the "rant". I read a mixed bunch of reviews before I went on my trip about haunted rooms, thefts and it not being the best of hotels. But I thought "hey, I’ve stayed in some pretty cr*ppy places, how bad can it be?” Well let me tell you, it can be BAD!!!! We (my girlfriend and I) arrived at the Carter late on Thursday 14th December 2006. We were greeted as we opened the door by the delightful whiff of the greasy cafe that is, for reasons unknown, adjoined to the hotel entrance. As we climbed the hotels steps, tastefully decorated in Technicolor patterns, set off by the various tones of dirt, grime and trodden in chewing gum I took the opportunity to admire the strange dolls that are displayed in glass cabinets around the entrance. As I admired them, and the 3 working Christmas lights that surrounded them, I enjoyed the tasteful out-of-tune music that played in the background. I can only compare it to a musical Christmas card that was low on batteries. Not put off, my girlfriend and I made our way to the reception. The first thing that struck me about the reception area was the fact that it had clearly been designed to stop people leaping the counter and attacking the hotel staff. This being New York, I thought perhaps these sort of things happen. When I met our "Friendly" night receptionist, I soon learnt that all this security was in fact to keep her in. To say this woman was rude is an understatement. She had clearly attended the Adolf Hitler School of charm and passed with honours. After we received what I can only assume was the standard level of abuse and rudeness (and were charged for the pleasure) we made our way up to our room. We were on the 19th floor, and let me tell you a ride in the lift (which I believe was last serviced upon the buildings contraction) is an experience in itself. Will you make it? Won’t you make it? It’s all very exciting. When we got to the 19th floor hallway, the first thing that strikes you is the lighting or rather, lack there of. There is a 40 watt bulb once every 40ft, so its kind of like staying in a poorly lit multi-storey car park (but dirtier). We made our way to our room and arrived at our door that was tastefully decorated a nice shade of green/dirt with a few dents and smashes for good effect. On entering our room we saw that it was last cleaned some time in the mid thirties. The linen looked relatively fresh, except for a very suspicious stain, and the bathroom … well, lets just say if the room was cleaned in the mid thirties it was by a lazy cleaner who forgot to do the bathroom. But still, as I’ve said, I’ve stayed in some bad places and was not about to let a few decades of dirt, an abusive receptionist and dodgy lift put me off. I was in NEW YORK BABY … Having emptied our stuff into the spacious wardrobe (ooh another good point, sorry there was two) my girlfriend decided to have a quick wash before bed. As she did this I lay on the bed and decided to check out the wonder of American television. No sooner had I turned on the TV then came a yelp from the bathroom followed by the door opening and my girlfriend in fits of hysterical laughter. I walked over to see what was going on, when I noticed what was coming out of the taps. Now, I’m not too sure how to describe this but it was kind of like lumpy gravy with flecks of grey. Thankfully, we did have both hot a cold running versions of it. I was going to phone reception to complain when I remembered that this may mean I would anger the receptionist and god forbid, they set her free to come find me. So, we left the taps to run for 10 minutes or so and they did eventually run clear. So, I went back to my laying on the bed and watching TV when something caught my eye on the wall. I looked, and with the reviews of this being a “haunted hotel” ringing in my head, I saw a pentagram had been etched into the wall. Fan-bloody-tatstic! Immediately wanting to get this out of my mind I thought I go to the window, pull the curtains back, and have a look at New York by night. I was quite impressed with the 5 square foot of Times square I could make out from our window and watched the bits of HUGE advertising boards I could see light up and change. As I stood there, I became aware of my right leg starting to get cold. Assuming the ghost of the Carter had come to get me I slowly glimpsed down to take a look at it. But instead of a gruesome spectre I instead saw that there was a hole, about the size of my fist, in the wall leading directly to the outside world. I was all set to complain, when I realised there was actually a better view of Time Square from the hole than there was from my window. So that was my initial experience of the Carter, and frankly in the 2 nights that followed, it didn’t get any better. No doubt you are now reading this thinking “well if it was so bad why the hell didn’t you change hotels?” And the reason for that simply was we were there with another couple and the chances of getting 2 rooms on the weekend before Xmas were not good. Plus, I wouldn’t have been able to have such a good rant had I stayed somewhere different. So, in summary … would I stay at the Carter again? NO. Yes it is cheap, but not cheap enough to warrant the state the place is in or the rudeness of the staff. I would highly recommend more spending a bit extra and staying somewhere where you don’t need several inoculations before visiting.I cannot say enough bad things about this hotel. We stayed at the Hotel du Champ de Mars in mid-June of 2009. The trip was for personal leisure with my boyfriend, my cousin, and her husband. I should have taken it as a sign not to stay at this hotel when, previous to our stay, I made many attempts to contact the staff via email on their own website, and never received any response. During our June 2009 trip we stayed our first 3 nights in Paris, spent 3 nights in Rome, and then one last night in Paris. The first 3 nights in Paris we stayed in 2 different hotels and both were miles above Hotel du Champ de Mars in every stretch of the imagination. I am very grateful that Hotel du Champ de Mars was booked for the beginning stretch of our trip because our 1-day stay at this hotel was more than enough. Horrible! There are 3 reasons that I chose to book this hotel in the first place. (1) It was in close proximity to the Eiffel Tower, (2) it was highly recommended by Rick Steves, and (3) the photos on the website appeared very cute for the low price. After staying here, I wonder why this hotel comes recommended at all. The rooms are decent, but beware that the single rooms donâ€™t leave you any extra walking-around room. The price is okay for the area (close to the Eiffel Tower), but to avoid their rude staff, I personally would pay an extra 10 euros to stay somewhere else. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted (this is much too friendly of a word for his demeanor) by an attendant at the reception desk. After giving our name, he just blankly stared at us. I think he was counting our number of guests (only 4 of us) and was confused because they had us booked in one double room and one single room. Mind you, we confirmed the reservation no more than a week prior and had booked 2 double rooms for 4 people. Needless to say, the hotel was completely booked so we were stuck with the incorrect bookingâ€¦yet charged the same price as if we had 2 double rooms as originally booked. We tried to haggle with this since it was not our fault they overbooked their hotel, but the desk attendant kept stating as long as 2 people were staying in the single room, weâ€™d have to pay double-room price. Oh, and he added, if we didnâ€™t like it, we could leave (and that is pretty much a direct quote). Yeah, at 6pm on our last night in Paris, find a new hotel and still be charged cancellation at this oneâ€¦I think not. We were stuck with this hotel at this point. Our room (the one my boyfriend and I had) was on the ground floor. It was a decent size and pretty cute. I will attach some photos. The cleanliness left something to be desired though. Wrappers (of who knows what) left on the floor, and many many hairs (ick!) on the bathroom floor and shower. I have photos of this too. It seems like they may have come in and made the bed, but did nothing else. It makes me wonder if they even changed the sheets. Luckily there was a window in the room (that looked directly into the window of the room across the way) and a fan in the cabinet, because this hotel did not have air conditioning. My cousin and her husbandâ€™s room, if I remember correctly, was on the 5th floor. There is a tiny elevator (which is common for Parisian hotels to only have a small one if there is one at all), but 5 flights of a narrow circular staircase is a long hard walk even if you are not carrying a suitcase. Since their room was incorrectly booked as a single instead of a double, their bed was a full size bed and the room was only about a foot wider on each side of the bed. Very tiny. The bathroom was also very tiny. I donâ€™t think they would have minded the tiny size of the room as much if they would have at least had a bed that fit the 2 of them comfortably. When we left the hotel later that evening, we were stopped halfway out the door by the desk attendant stating that we would have to leave our key at the front desk. It took us by surprise (since this was never mentioned when we arrived at the hotel) and I have to say we didnâ€™t feel 100% comfortable leaving all our belongings in our room with him having the key to enterâ€¦especially with the rude way we had been treated upon our check-in. I guess that is why we had bought luggage locks before the trip. Later that evening we left the hotel again to do some sight-seeing and the desk attendant was not even at the desk for us to drop off the key. We had to wait in the lobby while a 3 other couples also piled up in the lobby to wait. Eventually the desk attendant sauntered out of the bathroom to collect the keys, but only after I had the chance to read a magazine. Overall, our stay at Hotel du Champ de Mars was unpleasant. The rooms were decent in dÃ©cor, but they were not clean and the desk staff was beyond unpleasant and rude. I canâ€™t imagine they would have been of much help if we would have needed help with anything or needed tourist information. And the desk attendant upon leaving in the morning was equally as rude as the one the night prior. This one ignored us and stared at the computer in front of us and did not look up until he was greeted first. And then his only greeting was to correct our French. This hotel gives French staff a bad reputation and was our only unpleasant encounter of our 8 day trip. My opinion is that they think they can get away with treating people in this manner because being in a foreign country you do not have much recourse against them, and they have a steady stream of tourists and no need for you to be a repeat visitor. In hindsight, I would stay at Hotel de la Paix (the hotel we stayed at our 2nd and 3rd nights in Paris, only a few blocks away and closer to the Eiffel Tower, and the staff and rooms there were excellent) instead or try something in the Notre Dame area. Never again would I stay at Hotel du Champs de Mars and I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone.Istanbul was very beautiful and historical place . Stayed at Grand Hyatt Istanbul for 6 nights in November 2010 . Front Office Staff was very RUDE and USELESS . Our travel agency booked and we paid our hotel accomodation on Sept . 2010. requested for an early check in and connecting rooms . I even called the hotel front office 2 days prior to our arrival to confirm our request of interconnecting room . Arrived Istanbul at early morning as stated on our reservation confirmation . To horror of all horrors .. after a whole night of travel .First , Mr. Murat has told us that our reservation was cancelled by our travel agency . No explanation at all .Got to call our Travel agency overseas many times . My husband told them we got a voucher and reservation confirmation No. 45160645. We paid our hotel accomodation on Sept . 2010. A month and a half before our arrival to Istanbul . Why does Mr. Murat doesn't focused on the name indicated in the hotel voucher and the reservation confirmation . No rooms available for us even we got a voucher and a Grand Hyatt confirmation of reservation with a request of interconnecting room . We understood that the hotel is fully booked and normal check in time was 14;00 p.m but what we were requesting was a connecting room because I have my children with me . I think all mothers would do the same . Front office Staff was offering a room ,3 rooms apart from each other . We are all exhausted for travelling the whole night and waited for our room till 14:00 p.m. Only one room was available . Very distressing . Front Office Staff was very useless, kept on blaming our travel agency eventhough we kept on telling that we have Grand Hyatt Istanbul confirmation number .We sounded like a broken discarded CD. They kept on confusing us by saying that our reservation in another name was cancelled though it was very crystal clear that the name indicated in our hotel voucher and the Grand Hyatt confirmation No. 45160645 was very valid .The front office Mr. Murat was very unreasonable and twisting everything .No hospitality or kind gesture at all . We even requested for a room besides each other if no connecting room available. Being a helpless tourist family in Istanbul ,One of my son was already sleeping in the sofa and my 5 year old daughter was too sleepy , we agreed as family of 5 to be squeezed in 1 room with 4 big suitcases in the 7th floor .Waiting again for another room far away as it was was being prepared . Five minutes promised waiting becomes. another hours . I kept on calling our travel agency in Dubai and my phone bill amounted equal to a one night stay . The drama kept on going as the Front Office Manager entered the scene as I requested to speak to the GM of the Hotel. . F. O. Manager kept on blaming us and our travel Agency . His voice was very loud in the telephone . I explained to him that since September 2010 we paid our hotel and I even called Grand Hyatt prior to our arrival . I told him that we have reservation No. 45160645 from Grand Hyatt Istanbul . He told me that other guest have confirmation for interconneting room before they arrived Istanbul .I asked him how the other guest avail the interconnecting room confirmation . How come they havent told me when I called the front office prior to our arrival . I even aked how the other customers avail of interconnecting room confirmation . His answer was twisted again . Kept blaming our travel agency and told me that If I have a confirmation of interconnecting room they will upgrade us to a suite . Making the matter worse than solving it . I told the Front Office Manager , Mr. Furqan that our travel agency is one of the biggest and reliable in Dubai but if we need to take legal action.. we will do so . Suddenly with a speed faster than lightning and Superman , He offered us 2 room besides each other on the 6th floor . 2 rooms besides each other suddenly dropped from the sky . What a great way to start our holiday ... our first tour was cancelled because of Grand Hyatt front office staff . Front Office Staff focused on blaming instead solving the issue . They made the guest feel unwelcome , helpless and hopeless . Grand Hyatt Istanbul F and B Department were EXCELLENT . Thay are exceptional in many ways . Staff at the Agora Buffet breakfast are attentive and cheerful . Wide selection of food and the Simit Local bread was delicious .We dined for 5 nights through Room Service . Staff of Room Service and their Chefs were exceptional and the gave us the finest in dining . The king prawns , tomato spaghetti , yogurtlu kofte , spring chicken ,urfa kebab ,beef burger ,cheesecake are savory . F and B Department made our stay in Istanbul worthy . Housekeeping Staff always kept our room fresh and neat . They always make sure our simple request were granted like ironing board and the iron . The lady answering the phone for HK was courteous. Warmest Thanks to the all the Staff of Grand Hyatt Istanbul excluding the Front Office and Concierge . I hope . Mr. Jan Peter van der Ree,General Manager of Grand Hyatt Istanbul understood the situation we 've been through . Kindly do the needful .Please give proper training of Customer Service to all your Front Office Staff and Concierge.They must learn to respect the guest and to deal with courtesy . This will be our first and last stay in any Hyatt Hotel. BITA Tours toured us for four days . Amazing Istanbul. Visited Blue Mosque , Topkapi Palace Hagia Sophia , Dolmabahce Palace , Bhosporus Cruise , Spice Bazaar and Princes' Island . From Grand Hyatt we walked several times to Istiklal Cadessi . The locals were mostly nice people. Beautiful Istanbul . So rich in history and a very interesting place to visit Their carpets , textiles , ceramics and jewellery are the best in the world. Warmest Thanks to the beautiful and kind people of Istanbul . We will be back againAwful Awful Awful!!! This hotel is the stuff nightmares are made out of!! I stayed recently for 3 nights as I was attending a last minute event at Earlâ€™s Court and everything else close by was either sold out far in advance or was over Â£200 a night. That should have been my warning sign!! On check-in at 10pm at night, we were asked to pay for parking for 3 nights in advance (Â£36), which I did and was then told to move my car as I parked where vans park. I said there was no sign saying vans only, but I was told it was there. It must be invisible!! Anyway at 10pm with no light on in the car park (there is one, the reception just didnâ€™t bother to put it on) I moved my car in the awkward and cramped car park. I then got the room key and that is when I had a freak out! You can only get 1 person and 1 suitcase at a time into the elevator or 2 people and no bags. When we got out on to the 1st floor the doors were cracked and broken, stains on the carpet, wallpaper falling off and cracks in the ceiling. We got to the room and I had enough. The double bed was against a side and back wall, there was 1 foot width of space at the side of the bed to the window, and there was wallpaper hanging off the wall on to the pillow. There was also a small shelf area and a cupboard but nowhere to put our 2 suitcases except on the bed itself. I went back to reception and asked for a bigger room but was told only a twin was available. I didnâ€™t book a twin. I booked a double and asked how they could expect 2 people to stay in that room and have room for bags. The receptionist told me I could take the twin and move the beds around and when I asked if he would help us do that, he said no as it was light enough for us to move ourselves! This time, we got the lift to the 2nd floor. This was as bad if not worse than the 1st as some of the light casing was broken and there were wires on view. We moved the twin beds together to create a double and with the extra space managed to put our cases between the bed and the wall. This was not good when we were trying to move I can tell you. The windows were dirty, the frames cracked, and there was no air con so the room was roasting hot. We had to sleep with the windows open, if you could call the 3 nights of tossing and turning from nightmares thinking I was in Bates Motel sleep!! Our room was at the front so it was on the main road where there is constant traffic so constant noise too. We had 1 bath towel and 1 hand towel for the 2 of us and only 1 pillow each but we did ask and get more. There is no hair dryer and the coffee mugs were dirty and the coffee sachets covered in something sticky so we didnâ€™t chance using them! I know this hotel was ridiculously cheap at Â£80 a night for London and I wasnâ€™t really expecting air con, but 2 feet of space, a clean glass and somewhere to put my suitcase is not too much to ask for an establishment that has the cheek to call itself a hotel! On our 1st morning we went into the small cramped bathroom where we were greeted by the lovely sight of the pipes of our sink uncovered, dusty and very very worn. And then we spotted the previous guests dirty face cloth still on the shower rail. On our way down to breakfast we gave it to reception who did not say a word! No apology. Nada! There are signs all over the hotel about how they will not accept liability for items stolen from your room but you can leave them with reception to lock away. We had laptops with us and practically had to argue with reception for them to take them behind for us as if we had left them in the rooms and anything did happen then what would happen? Were they just paranoid or is there a history of theft? I donâ€™t know but this made me a little scared to be honest as it was being made into such a big deal! The breakfast room is in the basement. You know this will be a disaster! The stairs on the way down had several empty bottles of alcohol lying on them so some guests had had a party the night before and not only was it not cleared, it was a health and safety problem! The smell and the heat of the breakfast room was disgusting. Luckily though we managed to get some boxed cereal. While the kitchen looked clean enough the smell was enough to make us loose our appetites and cereal was all we could manage. And for future reference, they donâ€™t have the cereal sitting out, but we saw empty boxes and asked for some. Service with a smile this was not! More like service with a sneer! 10 minutes to get a cup of coffee and warm milk for the cereal! We decided to use the toilet beside the breakfast room on our way out to save us going back to the hell hole of a room. This was a mistake. The ladies had a dirty towel lying on the floor and I gagged when I saw the state of the toilet which was covered in excrement. I practically ran out of there! I have seen some nasty public toilets in my time, but in a hotel? It was just wrong! The next 2 days were pretty much the same. Then on our final day (checkout was 11am) I asked if we could leave the car in the car park until 5pm as we did not check-in until 10pm and I had paid for 3 nights parking. First of all I was told â€˜No. You have only paid for 1 nightâ€™. I said I had paid for 3. Just by chance I kept the receipt and I showed it to the receptionist who still didnâ€™t believe me until she could find a hand written record of it. When I told her which was my car I was then told â€˜Youâ€™re the owner. We didnâ€™t know whoâ€™s that car wasâ€™! Even though I gave them my registration at check-in?? Crazy! When I asked again if I could leave my car until 5pm I was told â€˜No, you must pay another Â£12â€™. Thankfully the area is not a controlled parking zone on Sundays so I left and found a parking space on the street. No way was I ever going to give them another penny! At Â£80 / night... yes this is very cheap for London... but No way will I stay there again. Itâ€™s worth paying the extra for a comfortable nightsâ€™ sleep and some sanity!! Over a week later I still get shivers thinking about how awful it was! Do not stay here!Would never go back~horrible especially for families HELLO ALL~ I will start off by saying that I read a lot of great reviews before deciding on my families last minute vacation (and most of the reviews were really pretty good)? With that said, my family and I were not happy with the vacation at all and actually wish that we had not spent our money and time at this destination. Now looking back at the reviews, I can only assume, that most of the great reviews that I read were written by young (early 20's) either friends or boyfriend/girlfiend type situations where just having a cheap place to stay with a beach and bar is what they need. I have been there done that and understand :-) But we needed a bit more and didn't get it at all!!!!!!!!! We are 34, well traveled professional couple with 2 small kids (daughter' 2 and 6 years old). IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN (ESPECIALLY YOUNG KIDS) DO NOT EXPECT A KIDS CLUB OR ANY CONSISTENT, RELIABLE OR SAFE CHILD CARE!!!!!!ARRIVAL and ROOMThe arrival was smooth (weird but cool outdoor airport :-) I thought it was neat (even though it was terribly hot :-)Check-in at the hotel was smooth. The room was clean and small (with 4 people and me being a bit of an over packer) there was no place for the luggage and was really cramped. There were 2 double beds. It was fine and we didn't see mosquito's (which we were worried about with other reviews we read). We left $2 in the minibar  for the cleaning staff the first day and also $1 daily. Never a problem with either and actually the minibar was so well stocked we started taking the extra beverages out with us to give to the grounds keepers  security guards (they were very appreciative for a cold coke)FOODTHE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE. I have to say that maybe we are a bit picky when it comes to good food. We enjoy a good gourmet meal once in a while and do buy fresh veggies and high quality meats in our home. So maybe we are a bit picky but we have been to plenty of other resorts and have always enjoyed the crappie buffet food (sometimes the unhealthier the better tasting :-) But this was low quality  poorly seasoned. I really do look forward to the pig out buffet stuff we all get at these all inclusive resorts but this food was absolutely horrible and I truly did not find 1 thing in any of the buffet's or restaurants that I looked forward to eating. We ate at the Steakhouse twice and twice it was horrible. Next to the steakhouse is takeout pizza. The pizza was OK nothing special but nothing terrible. The beachside restaurant called La Uva at the Golf Hotel that is good. Tables are in the sand on the beach and it is only open for lunch.Oh and none of us got sick but we brushed out teeth with bottled water and rewashed the fruit in bottled water as well before eating it. We tried to be careful and no one from our family got sick (but we did see others complaining at the front desk and looking terribly sick).CHILDREN'S ACTIVITIESNONE! There was a kids club that was basically nonexistent they claimed to always be looking for the girl that was supposedly running it that day. When she was finally found there were no activities planned, she didn't speak English (so my 6 year old couldn't even talk to her). The worst was when I had my older daughter go on a walk to the beach with the counselor (about 1/8 of a mile) and 2 other kids we had met ages 3 and 10. We (the 2 sets of parents) stayed by the pool to relax and after about 10 minute we see the 3 year old walking alone and sort of looking around for us and crying. The counselor had just let this little 3 year old wander off unsupervised (as if on vacation there are no psycho pedophiles or crazy people). I was enraged that so little thought went into the child care. So for us it was a vacation with no supervised child care or alone time at all. Oh and it was funny telling my 6 year old to stop staring at the topless ladies (that were everywhere) :-)DRINKI do not drink very often and am usually a cheap date :-) getting drunk from one rum  coke. Even I didn't get tipsy the liquor is so watered down. My husband and I speak Spanish, tipped large and regularly and still couldn't get drunk :-) well let me say that my husband started getting tipsy finally after a few days of only drinking beer and lots of it. :-) LANGUAGEWe didn't have a problem because we speak enough Spanish to feel comfortable. But I advise learning a few needed words (If I had to use the bathroom, and the staff couldn't direct me to the bathroom because they didn't understand me, I would have lost it). OVERALLThis place sucked and we found a lot of other vacationers that felt the same way. I know it's cheap and you get what you pay for (yatta yatta yatta). But it is not cheap enough to be worth the feeling we had as we left thinking to ourselves we should have gone to Jamaica :-)Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.I suppose the heading says it all. Avoid staying in this hotel like the plague. I was drawn to it because of its position which is indeed very central and convenient. It is just a few meters from the Metro station and just five minutes walk from Sol and all other city attractions. But then again, this is the only positive thing I can write about this hotel. Right from the start, it was obvious that the staff were the 'bored and unhelpful' sort, where if one asks whether they can speak some English, you get an answer in Spanish and a look that could easily pierce one's heart...!! Just going through the moves would seem to be their motto and it seemed to me that they just couldn't wait to be off work asap. The room was bare. Strictly three pieces of cheap furniture: 2 shoddy beds, a dressing/TV table and a bedside table that if given to someone free of charge, he/she would decline to accept such outdated scrap in one's home. TV set seemed older than myself at 50 years. The bathroom was basic as one could expect with no basin and bath plugs meaning that to shave, one had to leave the water running all the time and could not make use of the basic necessities as one is used to. However, the worst was the noise from students..!! They arrived one afternoon and it was obvious that trouble was on its way. They shouted, screamed, yelled, banged on their doors and our door so many times that I had to get out in the corridor and yell louder than them in order to try and get some peace and quiet. Did they stop? No they did not. I went down to the reception desk to inform them that it was simply unacceptable to have forty unruly students shouting and banging in this as we deserved and had the right to decency and peace. They told me that they will speak to their mentor but in affect, they never did. When I could take it no longer, I once again confronted them myself and shouted over their noise in English which was obvious they could not understand and even tried to ridicule the fact that I was trying to quieten them down. The only humane solution at that moment was to get myself and my wife out for the afternoon and evening hoping that things would eventually quieten down. On our return around midnight, chaos was reigning supreme and the level of noise, banging doors, laughter and running around in corridors and over furniture (it seemed so) was beyond comprehension. We had to fly back the following day and we were looking forward for a decent few hours of sleep before our travelling but it was only to be so in our dreams... All night long the chaos continued on. Banging doors and walls. Loud laughter and pranks in the balconies that one had to close the balcony door in order to shut some din out. This in spite of no air-condition in the room but it was the better of two evils. Once again, I had to don some clothes and try to quieten this anarchy down. Their mentor heard me shouting and did come out but the students were too many for this teacher/mentor and they simply ignored him! Who cares about other guests, that they paid for some privacy and peace, that it is our right as guests to have responsible reception people bring this situation under control. The kids did not care, the mentor was hopeless and the hotel staff simply did not care.. This is far from proper service form the staff and they even tried to tell me that it was 'normal' and they could do nothing. Nothing I ask?!?! They were just not bothered to get into the lift and do their job. They were simply way too comfortable sitting on their fat bottoms to get up and warn these unruly kids that this was a hotel were guests pay to stay there and not a playground were they could romp, bang, shout and yell as if there's no tomorrow. We left early that morning (before 0500) mainly because I could not take it any longer. I'm used to disciplined persons, normal and understanding people and helpful staff. I am in the hospitality business and this would have never been tolerated by my staff or myself. Never, ever.. I wish I had paid more attention to other reviews on this hotel as before booking, I had noticed similar complaints from previous guests, especially on the rowdy students issue. However, I thought that it might have been a one off not knowing how wrong I was!! It is now obvious that this is a regular pattern and the hotel is used to house students from other areas and countries mainly because they get a very cheap deal filling in their empty rooms. No wonder the decor is lifeless and the furniture so rundown, lest the surdents will demolish it overnight. With this in mind, of course, this is not a hotel one wants to stay in for his/her holiday. If the operators had to be honest, they would rename it as a student hostel, a place where serious grown ups and paying guests should avoid. Yet, honesty seems to be a very scarce virtue nowadays and it is through these reviews that the majority of travellers and would be users can have a true and honest insight of what this hotel really is. We used it as a base, nothing more, nothing less. Whatever you read about this hotel, know one thing and one thing only - it is a place of old fashioned, outdated, redundant and rundown decor and an obvious lack of care, interest and knowledge of how to accommodate guests in a city such as Madrid. This hotel is an insult to a lovely city which throbs with life all day and night long. A city rich in history and culture that draws inspiration from men of chivalry so many centuries back. Madrid is a city of good food, excellent wine and plenty of Sangria. A city of colour and nice plazas, plentiful to be honest. The Plaza Major is a place to take in whether during the day or night - just take it all in but eat in the restaurants close to it as they are much, much cheaper. All in all, Madrid is a dream - a lovely dream. The obvious conclusion from my experience is that Madrid is a city where everyone should spend some time during his life. As for my conclusions on the hotel - this is the hotel to recommend to your worst enemies if you want revenge.I have stayed in properties before that have had some negative TripAdvisor reviews,and have had no issues during our stay. Not the case this time... As I have stated in my other reviews, we are raising a 9 year old grandson. He wanted to see Las Vegas. My husband and I have been there several times and we knew that there were lots of things for him to enjoy (Hoover Dam, the Fremont laser show, the top of the Stratosphere, the Eiffel Tower, M &M World, the Bellagio fountains, the Habitat at the Flamingo, etc..). We also assumed that the Excalibur is family friendly. After all, there is the Fantasy Faire game room, the dinner show where you eat with your hands, the 4 pools, the whole castle themed thing... So we booked 2 rooms last December (3 months ago) for his March spring break. We reserved-and paid a deposit for-2 non smoking rooms with a wide screen TV and a view of the strip. We wanted non smoking as my sister and my grandson both have some problems when exposed to a large amount of smoke. Our flight did not arrive until 10 pm. When we checked in, we were told that all the non smoking rooms were gone. I said that I reserved these rooms 3 months prior. His reply was, "it does not matter how far out you booked your rooms. It is first come-first served." He told us that if we stopped back at the desk after 12 noon the next day, we could get our requested rooms. He also said that the hotel staff would help us move our belongings to our new rooms. It was really late by that time, and we felt as though we had no other option. We got to our 2 smoking rooms on the smoking floor. Not all of the key cards worked, so we had to make another trip downstairs to get new key cards. The view from both rooms was the roof of the casino below. All we could see was the red and blue turret towers. No view of the strip at all. We waited till noon the next day and asked to be moved to the rooms that I had requested months ago. We were told that they had 2 non smoking rooms ready and I asked if they both had views of the strip. I was told "yes". We were told that we had just enough time to go back to our current rooms and get our suitcases out of the rooms as our key cards would momentarily be deactivated to our 2 current rooms. There was no mention of assistance from the hotel staff to help move us. We hurried as quickly as humanly possible to our current rooms. Guess what, folks? The key cards to the rooms that our belongings were in had already been deactivated! We were furious! We were on our way back downstairs to talk to-who -knows- who in order to get into our rooms so we could get our things out. We spotted a hotel staff member on our floor. We explained our situation and pleaded with him/her to let us into our rooms. This person kept telling us to go back downstairs and talk to supervision until he/she saw the desperation in our faces. We were let in only if we promised not to tell as he/she was afraid of being fired! Fired? This is the only person since our arrival that was willing to go above and beyond and they were afraid of getting fired? How sad...We offered him/her some cash for saving us, but it was refused. What an awesome employee to help us out even when it meant their job was on the line.... We finally get in to our non smoking rooms only to discover that only one of the rooms had a strip view. The other still had a view of the casino roof and the red and blue turret towers. Only now with this view you could also see old hotel room furniture stored in an area on the roof and also a "punching bag" that had been hung-for staff use, I guess...Yeah, nice view. Shame on the staff member that just plain lied when stating that both non smoking rooms had views of the strip. We were so tired of taking that long walk back in order to get what we asked for that we just gave up and took the rooms. But wait, it gets even better..We spent some time at the pool and wanted drinks from the bar. The line at the bar kept getting longer and longer. The bartender was refusing to wait on anyone. Instead, he was gathering up bottles and wiping down the bar area for closing time. It was still a good while before the bar was to close for the evening. The line kept increasing and he just kept ignoring the customers. Finally another customer became very upset and told the bartender that his job was to wait on customers as long as there was one in front of him. I could not agree more. The gathering of beer bottles, mixers, and liquors can wait until the customers have all been taken care of or until after the bar closes-not before. Finally another bartender came out, but he was not much more motivated than the other one. We actually heard one of the bartenders say, "There are ticked off people here today. But I really and truly do not care." Yep, that was obvious,buddy. I am a former night club owner and I would have fired any bartender that had that attitude. And as for the bar/restaurant inside known as "Dick's Last Resort"-that place needs to be moved away from the path that leads to the rooms. As we walked by the place with our grandson (and there were a large number of other children on spring break walking by there as well) there was a young inebriated man and woman in the midst of an obscene and truly embarrassing act. I realize that it was also spring break for college students as well, but for Pete's sake, clean it up, Excalibur!! If you really see nothing wrong with what was happening in there, then please put up a wall so the rest of don't have to watch what bordered on "porn!" Family friendly hotel? I think not...... After our initial experience, we felt that we could just not spend our hard-earned money in the Excalibur restaurants, gift shops casino, etc.. So we spent it elsewhere on the strip. We felt as though "we really mattered" to the staff everywhere we went except the Excalibur. Customer service is what it is all about and my personal opinion is that this hotel just doesn't understand that. Even our 9 year old grandson picked up on the fact that the service was not all that it should be. I know that this "vent" won't make a difference to the hotel management, but I want the TripAdvisor readers to know about our experience. Will we visit Vegas again? Yes, indeed! Will we stay at Excalibur again? No way!!!Be leary of giving these ingredients to your dog!.I have studied canine nutrition for the last 5 years and one of the biggest negatives I see in many commercial dog food companies is putting profit over care.<br /><br />In looking at ingredients in treats and food, many companies are fabulous. However, sadly, some put the cheapest ingredients that often even cause negative reactions in dogs into their products and then add flavors to make the dog want them so they continue to be bought.<br /><br />Ah, but don't take my word for it.<br /><br />First ingredient in these? Rice Flour. Not meat. Not whole wheat flour. Not brown rice flour. Rice flour...bad carb, no protein, breaks down into sugar. But it gets better. Second main ingredient? SUGAR.<br /><br />Let me repeat that. This contains mostly sugar.<br /><br />Yes they are shaped like bones and you feel like you are getting some good protein in and that they aren't like giving your pet hard candy. Naw. That's marketing. They only contain 7% protein and the protein source is derived from "dried meat by product". In other words, meat waste.<br /><br />But lets go back to sugar. You could give your dog a tablespoon of sugar each day and they would crave that too. But you will also have to pay for extra tartar scrapings from your vet which are stressful to your canine companion or have a pet lose their teeth in their later years.<br /><br />But I'm just getting started. 3rd ingredient? Wheat flour. Not whole wheat flour...processed and stripped of it's nutriotional value. Cheaper. And of no nutritional value. Cheap.<br /><br />So you think the fourth ingredient must be some protein huh? Naw, it's Propylene Glycol.<br /><br />Then powdered cellulose<br /><br />Then sodium caseinate<br /><br />but we dont want our dogs to thumb their paws up at such ingredients so natural poultry FLAVOR is then added. This is what some dog companies do, besides adding sugar, to make a product marketable...have it TASTE to the dog like it has something they need or want in it but it just be a flavoring. Then they beg for it and owners think it's great, buy more, and profit is good.<br /><br />BAD.<br /><br />Now then, let me sum this up with the warning under the feeding guide:<br />"Up to (meaning no more than) 5 sticks every week"<br />and "not suitable for puppies or dogs under 5 lbs." Yet the jumbone mini with a yorkie on the front has these ingredients and then says not to give it to small dogs! That is called a legal disclaimer should your dog develop issues from the feeding of this product. What more needs to be said?<br /><br />Yeah, you don't have those warnings about nutritional harm when you just feed your dog some good natural treats or meat.<br /><br />Animal crackers or saltwater taffy would offer your dog the same taste and ingredients for the most part as these and be cheaper.<br /><br />I take it back. The above two wouldn't have as many artificial flavors and preservatives.<br /><br />Don't buy into the hype "big meaty center"<br /><br />If by "meaty" they mean 'sugar and cellulse" then I agree...<br /><br />I so hate seeing profit over care for companion animals.<br /><br />Why did I give it 1 star? I had no choice, but afterall, If you have to go by will your dog like it? You bet! But they like chocolate too...doesn't mean they should eat it.<br /><br />I am not promoting any particular dog food or treat here...just giving my opinion (based on 5 years of study on the subject on my part) that you may wish to avoid sugar and cheap fillers for anything going into your pet. Animals are so little and dependant upon our choices for them. And, especially if you dont brush their teeth daily as most of us don't, giving them something filled with sugar and bad-carb flours is highly detrimental to thier livers, teeth, livers, kidneys, and full canine systems.<br /><br />Not to mention the artificial fillers and dried meat by products. Meat waste can have very bad things in it. It's not suitable for human consumption (these include the parts thrown away that may be diseased or tumerous. Yes, seriously, these ARE allowed to be used in dog food.)<br /><br />And don't even consider the vitamins added. When made into a processed dog food of this type, they get baked out at such high temperatures used in the processing. So consider that teeninsy bit added at the very end of the ingredient list null and void after processing.<br /><br />Buy em a real soup bone or give them carrots or NATURAL wet dog food or cottage cheese for a treat.<br /><br />Dogs don't do well on things like this and it can cost you more in their health than the savings on buying a less expensive brand.<br /><br />I love em (pets) too much not to review this honestly...During my stay at the Tuscany, from 19-30 August, the following problems were encountered: * When I made my reservation, I informed Tuscany that my sister would be joining me for my trip in a nanny capacity, to watch the children, since the purpose of my trip was for government business. My reservation was for two adults and two toddlers. I also informed the Tuscany of the number of occupants in the room when I checked in, because my sister was arriving later than me and was going to be checking in separately. o When I checked into the room, I had to request extra towels, because there were not enough towels for the room occupants. o Each day, after housekeeping serviced the room (with inadequate cleaning), we had to call the front desk to request more towels. Consistently, each day, there were not enough towels for the room occupants. o When more towels were delivered, often the gentleman would wait awkwardly for a tip. Since I consider this a basic service of the room, not an added luxury or special request, I found this to be rude. * When I checked in, I requested two cribs. The cribs were initially delivered and set-up with sheets very promptly and the sheets were put on the foam mattress so the children could sleep on the sheets. After the first day, housekeeping would strip the crib foam mattress and would not replace the sheets. This would cause us to call the front desk to request sheets for the crib each time that housekeeping visited the room and cleaned, inadequately. o When the sheets were brought to the room, I had to insist that the staff put them on the crib. This should be standard practice. Again, the staff waited for a tip. * On Wednesday the 22nd, I went to dinner at Marilyn’s Café. The meal was good; however, when I tried to pay, the server was not able to charge my card. He informed me that I needed to pay at the front of the restaurant because his machine was down. I waited at the front of the restaurant for 30 minutes trying to pay for my meal because the staff was unable to get the machines working and didn’t start charging the meals to the room for almost half an hour. This was unacceptable. The restaurant should be prepared for simple things like credit card machine malfunctions. * I checked in on Sunday the 19th and my room was not vacuumed until the following Sunday, the 26th. o I complained to the housekeeper in building C on Friday the 23th, and the room was not vacuumed. o I complained again to the housekeeper in building C on the morning of the 24th and informed her that we would be gone until the evening and requested that the room be vacuumed. When we returned at 10pm that evening; the room had not been vacuumed. o I immediately complained to Vic at the front desk. I also informed Vic about my dissatisfaction with Marilyn’s Café and about my further dissatisfaction with housekeeping for the towels and sheets. Vic gave me a $40 comp to return to Marilyn’s and requested that I wait until the next morning to have to room vacuumed. Vic was concerned about the late hour and disturbing other guests with the noise from the vacuum. I understood his concern and agreed. Vic put in a notice to housekeeping to have the room vacuumed first thing on Sunday morning. (Vic’s customer service was the best in the hotel.) o At about noon on Sunday, I informed the housekeeper in building C that I would be taking the boys to the pool and would return in approximately 2 hours. I requested that she vacuum the room while I was gone. When I returned at 2:45 pm, my room had not been vacuumed. My sister complained to Tara in the Concierge office and Tara informed her that there was nothing she could do except try to get housekeeping to vacuum. At this time, I joined my sister in Tara’s office, with the boys in a stroller. When I initially attempted to talk to Tara, she rolled her eye at me as if I were just another customer trying to get a discount by complaining. Each time I tried to explain my concerns to Tara, she interrupted me. I found it extremely rude that she continued to interrupt me and both of our voices elevated during the discussion. She stated that if I didn’t lower my voice she would call security because customers could hear us in the lobby. I told her it wasn’t my intent to yell, but that I didn’t care about the customer service for the other guests anymore, because the hotel hadn’t showed any customer service for me yet. As Tara called security, she stated, “What kind of parent would bring her child down here to complain? What kind of parenting skills are you teaching your child?” I found this comment to be a personal attack on me and extremely inappropriate. My husband is currently serving on active duty in the Army and is deployed. My son stays with me, even when I travel, because I try to be the best Mom that I can be. Her comment was completely offensive to me. No manager, in any profession, should personally attack a customer or question their parenting skills as an easy way to abort a conflict. * Before I arrived at the Tuscany, I coordinate to have a package shipped to meet me at the hotel. I called ahead to the front desk before I departed for Las Vegas and the front desk said that it would not be a problem to receive and hold a package for a guest. When I checked in, I was told that the bell desk receives and holds all packages. I informed the bell desk of the pending arrival of my package and continued to call each day until my package arrived on Tuesday the 21st. On Saturday the 25th, I finally received the message that my package had arrived. When I returned from my day trip that day, the message light on the phone was blinking and when I called to get instructions on checking the voice mail, I was informed of the message for the package. Now, this incident was relatively harmless, because I was diligent about tracking my package. However, this is not a timely or functional service for guests!Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

It's garbage.Waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well.My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in April 2011. I decided to stay here even though this hotel is NOT IN ROME because I had some points that I thought I’ll use. I also purchased some points to get the necessary figure for the 5 nights stay. First of all this is not a four star hotel and SPG should disassociate itself from this hotel as soon as it can! I knew we had made the wrong choice about a hotel in Rome when it took us 4 hours after baggage claim from Rome Fumicino airport to get to this hotel. We took the Buzshuttle for EUR 8 per person to Rome Termini. Walk into the Termini station which is about 5 mins from where the bus drops off. Cobble stone streets and dragging luggage, this was not fun! Then find a newspaper stand and buy the ticket, then look for the blue line and take one to EUR Fermi. This by itself is a village outside Rome. The hotel website says that you can take bus 705 from right outside EUR Fermi. It may sound easy but it’s not. None of the outer stations have escalators, so with luggage climbing up 2-3 flights of stairs from the metro out to the street is again NOT FUN! Then after waiting for 15 mins we realised that 705 comes at the other side of EUR Fermi; so we crossed the road only to find out that there’s another set of stairs that go down (not up) to another bus stand. Again, no escalators. Then we had to tell the bus driver we needed to get to Four Points and he didn’t know where it was. As you can see, we were frustrated with the hotel even before getting there. The taxis will cost you EUR 70 (if they knew you are a tourist). Here are some of the reasons I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. I have gotten better service from a 2-star hotel: - Hotel is NOT IN ROME even thought their address says Rome. It takes you 1 hour and 15 mins to get to Termini station (which is the main station). Then you need to find your way via bus or metro. Not advisable if you are here for sight-seeing. - Do not depend on the bus and metro timings listed. Buses and trains come and go in their own time. Bus 705 and 130 (Sundays only) take you to EUR Fermi and then you take line B to get to Termini. But this is unreliable if you are staying in Rome for sight-seeing. If you have a flight to catch, take a taxi or a private car, whatever the cost! You don’t want to miss your flight. - No one came forward to help us with luggage at check-in at the hotel - Air conditioning will NOT be turned on in April when it is 30 degrees C at night inside the room. My husband and I couldn’t sleep for 4 out of our 5 nights stay. One night we had to fight with the reception to ask for air con and they said they will be doing us a FAVOUR by turning it on only for the one night. - A/C vent unclean and sends out a foul smell when a/c is turned on by the technician from the outside. You cannot control the air con in your room. Now which four star hotel does that?! - Sheets were not changed even though I had placed the “change sheets” card on the bed. I had to call reception again and have housekeeping come back in again and change the sheets. - No bars or restaurants near the hotel. You would be better off eating your dinner in central Rome. But be aware that the Metro Line B runs only till 9:00 pm. So either eat early, or take-out food and get back to the hotel in time. - Breakfast was not included in our rate because of points. It’s 25 EUR per person. Apparently, the reception staff told us that it was a discounted rate. The original breakfast was EUR 50. I walked to the closest supermarket Carrefour (1 km away) and bought breakfast stuff for our 4 days in under EUR 25 (for BOTH of us!). - Uncomfortable bed. I had back and neck aches every morning - No coffee making machine inside the room. Room service charge is EUR 15 per tray! I haven’t even heard of this in 5-star hotels. - No free internet/wifi (except in the lobby). We used the free wifi in the lobby once. - Rude reception staff. Surprisingly the housekeeping staff seemed nicer. Like I said, the man at the reception actually told us that he will be doing us a “FAVOUR by turning on the air con” for the one night. It was the weirdest experience and I felt sorry for putting my husband through such crappy experience because I had used my points for the stay. Rome was the last leg of our 18 day vacation and we thought we had booked the best stay for our last part of the vacation but we were totally disappointed. My husband and I are both frequent travellers and have never had such experience even from a 2 star hotel much less an SPG! Now I notice that they've changed the name of the hotel from Four Points by Sheraton Roma West Hotel to Nicolaus Hotels Roma West. Does that mean SPG has removed this hotel from their properties? I hope so!My wife and I stayed here - - or rather, didn't stay here, depending on your interpretation - - during a 12-day trip through Europe in October of 2011. We landed in Paris for one night before setting out for England and Germany, and for that initial night, used the Renaissance Place Vendome, which was outstanding. Based on reviews here, and the relatively low cost, we decided to stay at the Ares for three nights on our return to Paris to close out the trip. We just narrowly averted disaster. First off, if you do decide to stay at this place for some reason, be sure to get detailed routing info to the hotel from the hotel via e-mail. We didn't, and the cab driver took 10-15 minutes of trial and error and mapreading to find the very small side street upon which the hotel sits. Check-in was fine, about what I expected for a boutique hotel in Paris, where I've traveled before. The staffer at the reception desk was polite, but certainly not overly welcoming or warm. There was no offer of assistance with luggage, which, again, is to be expected for this sort of property. The elevator is absolutely tiny and not for the claustrophobic. The room cleanliness and overall appearance was exactly what I expected based on the TripAdvisor reviews; very pretty linens and drapery, huge bathroom with a window, plenty of space if you understand the general size of Paris hotel rooms. (Some reviews here say the rooms are small - - they aren't, not for Paris anyway.) Immediately, however, we noticed the distinct musty odor of cigarette smoke, which was disappointing for a nonsmoking room. I figured that the A/C would take care of it, and went to activate it, but found that I couldn't. I went downstairs to ask the staffer at the front desk what was wrong, and she told me (not rudely, but not very apologetically either) that since it was "so cold" outside, she had disabled the A/C for the entire hotel. This meant that there was no circulated air of any kind inside the room; no heat, no A/C, no central fan blowing uncooled air from the vents. As we continued our discussion in French, she told me that "in winter, there is no air conditioning." I'll grant her that it wasn't 80 or 90 degrees F outside (it was about 60-65 during the day and maybe 50 or a touch lower at night during our visit), but October isn't winter, and there's a difference between "no air conditioning" and "no central air." Both my wife and I have mild allergies and we need some sort of air circulating - - particularly if there's a lingering air of cigarette smoke from a recent guest. The staffer's solutions were to tell me to open the windows and to offer me an ancient-looking fan to carry back up to the room. The window solution was out of the question, as the Ares has large windows with no screens, and we weren't trying to deal with insects and perhaps even a bird in our room. The portable fan, of course, was unacceptable. I told her that this probably wouldn't work and that I would be back down soon to let her know. She said that was fine. I returned to my room, and my wife and I thankfully located a room at the Renaissance Arc de Triomphe (which was far more expensive but wonderful) for the remainder of our stay. We left, having sat in two of the chairs and logged on to the high-speed Internet. We were at the property for just over an hour. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, the front desk staffer was totally rigid and unwilling to waive the night's charges. She told me archly that I should have e-mailed the hotel in advance, and she would have readily told me all about the coerced deactivation of the air conditioning. I told her that wasn't my obligation, and since the hotel claims on its website that it offers air conditioned rooms, the hotel needs to live up to that promise. I simply didn't understand why any guests who didn't want A/C couldn't turn it off in their rooms, leaving any of us who did want to have some air moving around with that option. No dice! (I suspect the A/C might have been broken, but if so, she certainly wasn't telling.) In any event, although she had not taken my credit card upon check-in, I certainly didn't want to break any laws, so I handed it over and she happily charged us for the full night's stay - - about 350 Euros. She offered no apology and (even though we had seven bags) did not volunteer to call us a taxi. We walked to one of the nearby major streets, got a taxi, and went over to the Renaissance, thankfully enjoying it thoroughly regardless of the far greater cost. I followed up directly with the hotel by e-mail after returning home a few days later; they didn't even bother to answer me. No refund or reduction in the price was made, and the full charge appeared on my credit card statement as I expected. I realize that a lot of TripAdvisor registrants wouldn't care about this sort of situation, and a lot of people wouldn't want anything to do with air conditioning in Paris in October. Completely understood. However, the point of this review is not really in the details but in the big picture - - the Ares is fully prepared to mislead you about at least one of their claimed amenities (two, if you count the "no smoking" room that wasn't), and if you complain, they won't do a darn thing about it, and in fact will blithely ignore your request for a refund or price reduction later. So, if you're prepared to take that risk, the hotel is well-maintained and in a nice, well-located neighborhood once you find it - - just hope that you don't have any complaints! And, of course, if you like to have air circulating in your room during a "transition" month like October, April, or May - - forget it. Naturally, I will never stay at this place again. In fact, this experience has sadly soured me on all Paris boutique hotels. I'll be sticking with full-service establishments going forward. With the Ares, you definitely get what you pay for - - or in our case, you pay for it even if you don't get it. Lowest possible recommendation. Everything a hotel should not be.I wish I could be writing a good review because this is a beautiful hotel in a great location but there is absolutely nothing I can recommend after staying there. First of all, with only 73 rooms, they overbooked by no less than 7 rooms, so I spent my first night at the Holiday Inn which looks like a hospital. This is the first time it's ever happened to me, and I had already paid for the room for 8 nights! But misery loves company, and they overbooked/ displaced many other people. When I checked in I was given NO information. There is room service available but they don't tell you. The room has no instructions for phone calls and they don't tell you anything. The second restaurant (which is only open for dinner, not lunch) is actually in a different building, the spa which is next door (spa entrance is NOT included in your hotel stay and it's $50 just to go In). They have no activities, they don't tell you when or where meals are, nothing, nothing, nothing. The rooms are beautiful, and have great acoustics -- meaning you can hear everything!!! I was kept up by people in the next room -- the studios are not actually separate, they are bedrooms which are closed off from the suites. I got no peace, even after having the security guard knock on the door and asking them to quiet down. I was woken up every night either by them, or by a baby howling somewhere else. There is no rest to be had in this hotel, though the room was gorgeous with 20 foot arched ceilings. Food: boring,tateless. Orange juice pasteurized and watered down. Steak tasteless, all shrimp was mushy and nothing ever came hot even though most of it was cooked on a outside grill. (Even when it rained they did not open the dining room to let people inside to eat, they had us outside in the rain eating, and no I am not kidding and yes, I did ask them to open it). Every meal I had outside of the resort had more taste, although every meal I had outside the resort made me sick. Service: None existent. The head receptionist, Jessica would not even book a shuttle to the airport for me. (The hotel has their own shuttle which costs $60, a private taxi is $45 and other shuttles are $18). When she called and the hotel's shuttle was not available (she had not told me the price!!), she refused to help me any further. She and the other receptionists spent most of their time on the phone, it was nearly impossible to reach an operator from your room. Tour desk: They booked me on a $39 tour, where the entrance fee was only $2, and taxis about $7 each way. They booked me on another expensive tour where you have to be up at 5:30 a.m. and I waited and the bus never came. When I came back to the hotel, she got angry, called the company but I had to ask and go back twice for a refund and she never apologized. I asked to be referred to a time share and they wouldn't do it, but I recommend everyone else to go to a time share, because you get several expensive tours for free when you do go. Waiters: They invented the word greedy. I am a very good tipper, and at an all inclusive I would normally leave a large amount at the end of the week. The waiters instructed me to put it on the tab at each meal -- and a particularly greedy one -- his name started with an "O", instructed me to give him cash so he wouldn't have to split it with his fellow waiters. All of the waiters hover and stare at you as you write out the tip on the "checks" that you have to sign after all meals and drinks. If they don't see what you wrote, they open it as they take it off the table. But don't expect a "thank you" even if you tip 20 or 25%. Everyone at this place is not just out to put money in their own pocket, they are out to have you leave all your money in Mexico. There is really nothing to do at this hotel. The gardening staff refused to turn on the hot tub for me, there are no activities posted. There is certainly nothing to do here in the rain. The good part is that it is in a beautiful wealthy suburb (you have to pass through 2 guard posts to get into the area, which tells me it's not so safe), and it's only a $5 ride from the downtown area. I would not want to stay in the downtown area because aside from one street, Avenida Quinta, the rest of Playa del Carmen is squalid and rundown. I see no reason to recommend this hotel to anyone. Go somewhere bigger with more activities, better food (there were 3 meals a day, no snacks at this "all inclusive"). They take the cheap way out wherever possible here. They only have one small swimming pool, and only about 12 lounge chairs so that on sunny days it is still a challenge to get out early enough to get a lounger. Thumbs down. Go to Miami instead.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.My wife and I stayed here - - or rather, didn't stay here, depending on your interpretation - - during a 12-day trip through Europe in October of 2011.

Everything a hotel should not be.However, the food and service and dramatically lacking.My husband and I decided to take a trip to Mexico and stay at the Blue Bay Grand Esmeralda where we arrived on May 13th for 6 nights. To start, I have been a travel agent for several years, therefore, knew that this property was opening six years ago. At that time, it was not owned by Blue Bay, and looked as though it would be an amazing resort. I new that they were having some problems with the beach and the water in front of the resort. They spent several months trying to clean it up and get rid of the rocks and garbage that collected there. So far, it is still full of large rocks and muck up to your knees. For those who have never been to the Playa Del Carmen area, have no idea how beautiful the beaches are at the surrounding resorts. Compared to the other resorts, the beach is Ok but the water is disgusting, to say the least. Another problem that Grand Esmeralda has is that if you don't get to the beach by 6:00 AM, you will not get a palapa or a chair. People go out to the beach early and stake out there spot for the day even if they won't be using it until much later in the afternoon. This stands true with the pool chairs, as well. I also noticed that the pools were not very clean. The pools were filled with several young children and babies in diapers, so later in the afternoon, you could see a disgusting film and cloudy water throughout. I saw a film along the walls of the pool which caused me to not want to go in the pools. I found out that on weekends, the resort offered inexpensive packages for the local people, therefore you were taken over by the local Mexican people with several children. There were four ala carte restaurants as well as two buffets to choose from but good luck getting a reservation at the ala carte restaurants before 9:00 PM. Most people don't care to eat that late in the evening so end up at the buffets where you found the same food offered night after night. The buffets were the only choice for breakfast and lunch with the same selections over and over...runny scrambled eggs, overcooked bacon, cold hash browns, fruit and cereal selections. The ala carte restaurants had nice atmospheres but the menu was limited. You could pay an upcharge to get something much nicer than what was offered at the all-inclusive level. Lets talk about the rooms; I was so disappointed in the rooms. Nothing like other resorts at the same level were offering and very much like a motel. The hotel room was musty and very small. I didn't even want to unpack anything due to the smell. We had several mesquitos in the room and could see the marks on the walls from where previous guests had smashed them on the walls and curtains. The bathrooms smelled like raw sewage coming up through the drain in the sink. The wood in the bathroom around the sink and bathroom was moldy and rotted out and in need of replacement. I realize that it's caused from the humidity but this was really bad. We were suppose to have maid service each day but after the second day, the maid didn't show up. This is probably because we didn't leave her a tip. We often leave out tips on the last day of our stay. I was really upset when on the third day, I walked into my room at 4:30PM and the room had not been serviced. Imagine coming in from a day spent at the beach, and all you want to do in go into your room and take a shower. The water ran from hot to cold in a split second. We had no clean towels and the bed had not been changed or made up. I called the front desk and was told that the maids finish up at 5:00PM and if I wanted clean towels, I could get them but would have to wait until the next day to get my room cleaned. The hotel room has a refrigerator which is suppose to be stocked each day. On the second day, I was stunned when the restock boy barged into our room with out knocking. He had just assumed that we were out of the room somewhere. Needless to say, I went off and again did not even get an apology for the intrusion. Another complaint that I had was that the distance from the area that we were was quite a walk from the lobby or the restaurants. There was suppose to be shuttle service but we never saw one except to take us to our room on the first day. As you walk through the resort, the only thing that you can smell in the air is sewage and the only wildlife that you will see is the critters that are very much like our racoons. They were around in herds and really gross to see. My husband and I went on the balcony for a few minutes on the first day only to see a huge rat the size of a small dog. Seeing it made me not want to eat anywhere on the property. I'm sure there were several more where that came from. I have never stayed at a resort where the staff didn't go out of there way to make the guest feel comfortable. Perhaps that is why this place is very inexpensive to go to. We found the staff to be rude and uncaring about whether or not we were having a good stay. If you had any concerns or issues, the answer you would get is that the next day, they would try to clear the problem up...but that never happened and the worst part is...NO APOLOGY! Bad attitudes throughout the entire resort from the front desk to the waitstaff. To the traveller who wants to save money, or for families who have several children, or anyone from the age of 18 to 35, this is the place to go. If you're looking for luxury of to be pampered in any way, please reconsider and save your money. My advise is to avoid the Grand Esmeralda at all costs. This is not a 5 Apple property by any stretch of the imagination! Much more like a 3. As far as the people that have written "raving" revues about Grand Esmeralda obviously have never been to the Riviera Maya area previously. There are so may more beautiful resorts there. It's ashamed that this resort is only 6 years old and has so many problems. Generally when you are going on a vacation, you count down the day as it nears. I was literally counting down the day until we would leave this place. Than's pretty sad!LOTS OF PROBLEMS - STAY AWAY Where do I start? First, if you are even considering a vacation here, be warned to go elsewhere. This place is not what your travel agent may tell you. It is not nearly finished and should never have opened to the public - bad management. There are many safety hazards due to the fact that it's still undergoing construction - loose wires, rocks and dirt piles, etc. Aside from that, it lacks many basic services and amenities, much less anything approaching the 5-star quality that it is supposed to be.CHECK INWe pre-booked and prepaid for everything. When we arrived, they did not have ANY room for us at all. The hotel staff and management did nothing to assist us and were totally unresponsive to our queries or concerns (or offered tips) that we had a 3-year old child, nothing to eat, and nowhere to sleep. We saw and talked to many other people in the lobby who were stuck there for hours with no rooms, either. The resort was literally building the rooms and moving in the furniture as we waited, but even that couldn't make up for all the guests waiting for rooms. We finally had to go to a different resort for that first night, which we ourselves had to arrange since the entire staff was overworked, had many other people yelling at them, and were completely incapable of doing anything to help. Luckily we were able to find another resort with a room available for one night. The next day we finally got a room back at Majestic Colonial. Too bad.FOODTotally sub-par. NOT 5-star. Mostly buffet. House wine AWFUL. Even the choice of menu wines that you have to pay for were bad - nothing for a serious (or even casual) wine-drinker to enjoy. Bar service was chaotic at best. The entire staff is so obviously untrained - they literally walk back and forth doing nothing with dazed looks on their faces; if what you ask of them is too much (like ordering a drink), sometimes they will outright ignore you and walk away. Finally we found one server who was decent and just tried to seek her out whenever we wanted something. The a la carte restaraunts were okay, but not great. There are times of the day when there is no food available, which is unfortunate if you don't like to rush or have a timetable to adhere to, or if you have a child who naps through meal times and then is hungry when nothing is available. We were told there would be snacks, but these turned out to be only hotdogs and hamburgers at the beach bar - not the healthiest choice.ROOMSThe room we had was actually nice - poolside with private jacuzzi, which we used every day. The all marble showers and floors were beautiful but treacherously slippery. The room had a few issues - looked like it was rushed through, and there were a few holes and missed seals in the walls and corners and ceiling; I suppose that's how mosquitos constantly entered the room. Also, there were very loud crickets somewhere in the room that chirped constantly all night (no exaggeration), which got a bit annoying. No facecloths, no tissues, no garbage can, no mini bar (unless you consider a small fridge of bottled water and sodas), no snacks, no shower soap, only tiny circles of hand soap.GROUNDSThe grounds were very nice, but the landscaping needs filling in (the least of your worries, believe me). The paths are downright dumb - some lead nowhere, and you see guests cutting across grass and low shrubs to conveniently get to where they are going. Also, lighting is lacking in many places, making it a bit dangerous in places (like the bridges that cross the pool) at nighttime.POOLThe pool is the one thing that was gorgeous - a very long, huge, freeform pool. It seemed clean enough and we enjoyed that. We were a bit worried about a few troublesome filter areas that looked potentially dangerous to children, but we just stayed away from those. The bar by the pool is a bit annoying, as there was always some 'activity' staff trying to get tourists to do things - play volleyball, limbo, dance, or do other strange tourist trap type activities, and very loud ones.SPASpa, although open, is not quite ready, either. I had two appointments, which were botched (overbooked). The massage I got was basic, and the girl was so sick she had to leave the room twice to deal with her coughing fits. The showers, steam room and sauna were nice, but again, not quite ready yet.BEACHBeach is pretty - soft sand, clean water; saw some reef area and lots of fish (surprising). But near the resort there are a lot of construction rocks that were just thrown there and are now mixed with the sand, and also lots of broken glass. The beach chairs are comfortable but not enough of them for all the guests. There are catamarans and banana boats and donuts (?) and speed boats and kayaks available. We didn't do any of that, but people who did looked like they were having fun. One thing that was annoying were the many helicopters that constantly flew over the resort and buzzed quite close to the water and swimmers a few times - I think they are tourists on pleasure rides. We walked down the beach to see some of the other resorts. All the same, more or less. Lots of people, crowded bars, crowded pools.SUMMARYThe entire Punta Cana strip is basically row after row of all-inclusive mega resorts that cater to those who enjoy non-stop drinking and loud music. If that is your taste, you will like it here. If you prefer a quiet, relaxing vacation, you would be well-advised to consider somewhere else altogether. If you DO go to Punta Cana, stay away from Majestic Colonial for at least another year - it is simply not ready and not worth the headaches of everything that it is struggling with - no matter what discount your travel agent offers. If you're looking for 5-star, or any quality vacation, this is not it.I read many reviews on tripadvisor before finally selecting the Maroma over Tides and the Banyan Tree as our final destination on our trip to Mexico. One theme that was often repeated was that the prices in Maroma are very expensive - I assumed that this was referring merely to the room rates, but we got a rude awakening upon arrival. Everything here is vastly expensive - you can expect to pay between 3 and 6 times as much as you would elsewhere. Just some examples: the morning yoga will set you back $35 (+11% tax, +15% service charge = $44), the cheapest 50 minute massage will cost you $125 (+11% tax, +15% service charge = $157), a meal for two with 2 glasses of wine, 2 mains and a shared appetiser and dessert will set you back $132. A two-tank dive with the resort to the house reef (fairly dead) costs around $240. But, such prices might be considered acceptable if the hotel can deliver on what the prices promise: great food and awesome service. Unfortunately, Maroma delivers neither. Every day (save for our last, more anon), our breakfast was a disaster. Twice I ordered dishes with cheese in them and both times the dish tasted rancid, twice, the dishes we ordered arrived cold. Every time it was a lottery as to how long you would wait for tea or coffee - once my coffee arrived quickly, but I had to wait 20 minutes for milk (asking 4 people, including people offering me things like hot chocolate...), by which time my coffee was long gone cold. Room service was another disaster - our room was only cleaned once before about 2pm, and twice our room had its first clean and its turndown service at the same time! We made our disappointments known to their hospitality staff, and were told that someone from the management would try and fix things for us. Much later, the manager of the hotel spoke to us on the beach and asked us what he could do to 'make things better'. We were unsure how to react as we thought that surely most hotels would know how to make unhappy customers happy. We said we would think about it, and just asked if they could make our last meal there perfect if at all possible. We were assured that this would indeed be possible. Ha! What a disaster from start to finish - to begin with we were forced to eat in their 'premier' restaurant 'El Sol' - I'm not sure why they consider it 'premier' as it is musty and dated, when we would have preferred to eat on the beach (which really is a beautiful setting). A very quiet alarm bell went off when our server chose to 'remember' our order rather than write it down, but I figured they would have given us one of their better members of staff. But no, it was just a simple disaster. They forgot our starters and delivered our mains to us first. The person who delivered the dishes didn't know what they were and asked us 'who wanted the chicken?' - neither of us had ordered chicken - eventually saying, hmm, maybe it isn't chicken - what did you order again? Eventually we realised what had happened and asked for our starter instead. I made the point of asking if we would get fresh mains as I didn't want to eat a cold main (2 cold breakfasts was enough) to which I received the astoundingly insulting response "Don't worry - be happy". Seriously. A five star resort, and the waiter spectacularly screwed up our order, and rather than apologise, he tells us 'don't worry - be happy' - incredible. Twenty minutes later, our mains arrived. Mine had clearly been microwaved, while my wife's fish had been cooked afresh while all of her side dishes were allowed to go cold. Since it was our last night, we tried to put a brave face on it but my food was cold and inedible and I had to send it back. When we were finished, we asked for the bill and told "don't worry, it's been charged to your room." We insisted, and insisted again, and on the fourth asking, we finally received a bill - we were mostly interested to see if they were going to charge us the customary compulsory tip of 15%. When the bill arrived, I was somewhat surprised as a number of the dishes seemed to have cost more than they did on the menu, so I asked if I could see the menu again - instead of receiving the menu, I received a new bill with one of the over-priced reduced. I again asked for the menu to check the bill against it, and again I received yet another bill with another item reduced in price, at this point we said can we please just have a bill with everything matching the price that was in the menu and the service charge removed please. Finally, the manager came over and we tried to explain the situation and how utterly contemptuous we had found their definition of 'service' and ot his credit, he said he would not expect us to pay anything towards the meal as we clearly had not enjoyed it at all. We went straight to the hospitality desk and asked them to take the compulsory service charge completely off our bill for the entire stayas the whole experience was just awful - we spent more time saying to each other 'and another thing that is awful here is...' rather than just enjoying the last few days of a holiday which, up until we arrived at the Maroma, had felt like a second honeymoon. The following morning, they made an extra special effort for us, and our breakfast experience was pretty positive with some excellent coffee for me, rather than the usual watery brown stuff we had been served the few days before. The swiss hospitality manager apologised to us in person and offered us a bag of sweets to eat on the plane, and confirmed that the service charge had been removed from our bill. Sadly, it didn't make up for the experiences of the previous 5 days. Our suspicion as to 'what is wrong with the Maroma' is that the fact that the service charge is automatically added to your bill for every single little thing means that there is no incentive whatsoever for the staff to provide you with anything like acceptable service. Coupled with this, at breakfast they do not seem to have people assigned to tables to make sure that you get everything you want or need - it is totally haphazard as to what you get and when you get it. I would strongly recommend anyone to go elsewhere if they are looking for a fantastic experience on the Mayan Riviera.Two wasted steaks -- what a crime!I'm in NYC 10-20 a year for business, staying at all levels of hotels depending on company budget, policies and deals. I know what to expect from each grade of hotel. I wound up at the Paramount due to a client deal that covered my room and tax. Even if it were free again, I'd never stay here a next time. The room: NY hotel rooms are small but smart hotels offer storage and work solutions that maximize space. This had nothing. I was in 1841 which felt like the maid's room - and as I learned from the room guide, it probably was since the 18th floor was the original hotel's attic. The room was spartan: bed, one nightstand, a chair. No desk despite sufficient space for it (also no real dresser). A sad lopsided floor lamp. There was some rolling tray table that fit over the bed or in front of the lone chair. Great concept if every guest is over 5'8". I'm 5'4" and this was completely useless, too high. I had no place to do work. The closet was entirely taken up with a clumsy two-drawer cabinet that left only a 4" space to hang clothes...space further reduced by 1/2 because the ironing board was also stored there. So if you want to hang anything longer than a shirt, you can't. The bathroom is terribly outdated, with cheap 1980s metal fixtures. The room was dirty. Not in need of dusting or vaccuuming but a deep serious cleaning. It had two nasty decorative pillows on the bed that I couldn't toss on the floor fast enough with as little touching as possible. The toilet this disgusting black ring around the bowl at the water line. The toilet should've been replaced. It looked like mold was starting in the shower. The shower curtain didn't even reach the floor so water ran out everywhere. The ceiling vent in the bathroom hasn't been cleaned in ages and was full of black dust. I hated touching any surface in the room. I had no washclothes (my colleague had them daily). I had a $10 travel hairdryer; my colleague got a full-sized one. I was so busy on business that I didn't bother to try and change rooms. And the room was simply rundown. The rolling tray table was chipped. The walls were gouged, needing spackling and repair. Several doorframes were corroded at their bases. On the very last morning, I saw that one wall had been cut open for someone to reach an electrical box and hadn't been repaired but instead left peeling and fraying. Even the room service hangtag was beaten up, dirty and frayed - it looked as if no one had been in this room in a decade. The room condition was a disgrace. It was also unsafe: the marble threshold (the piece of marble that serves as the transition on the floor as you step from the bedroom into the bathroom) was abnormally high on the room side and I tripped the first time I went into the bathroom. The height of the threshold is probably in violation of NYC laws. It took nearly 5 minutes to get hot water in the shower. So I'd turn it on, do many other things and then come back to find it suitable. And a small but important point: someone had filled the peephole with gum or something. It was unnerving. If I had decided to spend one more minute than I needed to in the room, I would've alerted the desk to have it fixed. But the dismal condition and user-unfriendliness of the room kept me out of it as often as possible. Which cost the hotel several hundred dollars since I'm normally a room service user. Instead, I ran out as quickly as I could. A final point was check-in. Because of my travel schedule, I arrived too early to get my room - which was fine - but the woman at the front desk said she'd check me in and all I needed to do was stop back for the key. She saw that the room and tax were being covered. She asked for, looked at and made note of my photo ID. Oddly, she didn't want a credit card imprint although I would be responsible for non-room/tax costs. All set, she said. I returned 8 hours later to get my key before rushing out to dinner. What I encountered at the desk: --first, the man (Sean) couldn't find my reservation --once he did, he insisted that "there is nothing noted that the room and tax are paid for" - I kept reiterating that I'd already checked in and it had shown up at that time; he kept claiming otherwise --finally he found the room arrangements note but said the woman earlier hadn't taken my photo ID documentation. Useless now to argue with him. Plus, as should've been done originally, my credit card imprint was taken --I decided to use a particular card that's both a platinum-level Visa card ($8000 a day limit) and a debit card. Sean refused to use it as a credut card - despite the fact that it's noted as such on the card itself and had he run it as credit it would've been approved - and would only take it as a debit,. Which as he explained, required that a certain amount be withheld to cover incidentals in advance. Which wasn't appropriate but again, it was uesless trying to get him to understand. While the amount was nominal (and as explained, I had no interest in generating any additional costs in the hotel), he seemed to have no understanding about such cards or in even running the card as credit to see he was wrong. I've charged multi-day stays at better-quality hotels on this particular card with no problem but apparently it was too difficult for the Paramount. Instead, this guy wasted my time as I headed to a business dinner, This place is a dump with service to match. There are numerous comparably-priced hotels in the area that are better-designed and better-maintained. Use them instead.We ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came.I recently stayed @ the Holiday Inn Wall Street with my Fiance right after staying at the Chelsea Indigo and the Staybridge suites. At both those other hotels i received decent service but kept mentioning to my Fiance that Holiday Inn would be way better. I am a platinum priority club member & I travel alot for work at always stay at Holiday Inn Express and Holiday Inn they always treat me very kindly and go out of their way to make me happy. This is NOT the case in this hotel. On cleanliness, price, and location alone the hotel would receive a 3 the hotel is clean but going through construction which instantly dirties your suitcases, the price is great and by using points they are one of the cheapest hotels in Manhattan, and the location is not very great unless your day revolves around wall street and the Brooklyn bridge. Now for the service it was terrible I am a platinum card holder (the highest level) for the hotel and I dont believe i should be waited on hand and foot but I do believe I deserve to be treated respectfully. Let me start by saying there is i ONLY 1 great employee there and that is the woman in the complimentary breakfast section she is very kind and friendly. Everyone else could not make the time to be bothered. When i arrived for check in the girl behind the desk waited a couple seconds to attend to me since she was on her facebook then I was given a decent room. I wouldn't bother asking for upgrades or paying for the most expensive room all the rooms are pretty much the same with an uninspired view. The room is very small and the bathroom is even smaller I would not recommend this hotel to families but only solo travelers or couples on a budget. Since I am a platinum member I received a free "gift" bag that was made up of a bunch of flyers from local businesses, 2 waters, and a bag of cookies. Don't break the bank! Versus at staybridge i received gourmet chocolates, a bottle of wine, and a handwritten thank you card. At hotel indigo i received a credit for my room mini bar and a room upgrade. My first of many problems occurred when I did not receive information about how to log onto the internet I called down and the phone rang for awhile so I hang up called back a little later. Then second time I called back Carlos picked up promptly and gave me the information on the internet code. After seeing a mistake on my bill while looking online ($110 dollars for using my free night for "incidentals" even though with no mini bar or room service I don't know how this would be achieved) I called down spoke to Carlos where I was told he could not help I would have to wait for the manager in the morning. In our conversation I was told too calm down and let him speak even though I hadn't even explained the situation and was only talking for 5 seconds. I think he just didn't want to deal with me. In the morning I went over to the front desk to speak to the manager who was in the "back" I said I would wait. The person at the front desk continuously asked me whats wrong so that she could tell the manager I kept saying I would wait but finally told her the situation and she went to the "back" to speak to the manager. Seconds later she came back and said "Ok I'll take care of it" no I'm sorry, no were sorry for the inconvenience of charging you $110 on your vacation, nothing! Not even a visit from the manager. Finally, I went back to the room and then down to the business center at around 10AM. I first turned on the computer and had wait for it to start up, then it asked for a password to log in to the desktop that only the employees had. Luckily there was a phone in the center so i called over the front desk and they said they would send someone over. I waited 10 minutes and no one showed on my way up I saw a maintenance person who helped me turn on another computer than didn't need a log in. I began using the computer and another person came into to use the computer I told them it didn't work and that they would have to speak to someone. They too called the front desk and no one came. As i finished up I passed by the front desk to see that the person waiting for the computer was trying to explain the situation to the front desk person who not only didn't understand the situation but offered to change rooms, hilarious! Finally, I checked out, left the luggage with the front desk who leaves there bags at the front desk hours before actually putting it anywhere. I went around the city and at about 1pm I called over to the hotel and said I need a cab to take me and my family to Newark airport they said I had to call back and they would get me a rate. I personally think it would be more professional to call me back but oh well. I talked to the front desk a little later and they said it would be 100 dollars, plus toll, plus tip to get to the airport, which is way too much. In a cab alone the fair would be 80-90 bucks max with tolls & tip! How do i know this? Because I found a cab and this is what they charged. In fact last time I left from staybridge suites and got a limo the charge was $75 + tip! I'm very disappointed in that I feel some type of backdoor deal was made to charge me extra. Lastly, while I was holding a few bags from shopping I got my luggage on my way to the taxi waiting outside an African American gentleman at the front desk assisted me with my bags he pulled them out of the closet put them in front of me and walked away! Come on! Help me out! I understand your not the "bell boy" but give some type of decent service I would've tipped you! Overall getting a cheap stay is always good but spring for the extra money get the uptown experience and get decent to good service not horrible service. The staff did definitely needs to be trained correctly starting with the manager!WOW, Much Less Than Expected Let me just start of by saying my Fiance and I are not picky people at all. We just returned from this resort last night. We stayed there from June 28th to July 5th. I will honestly say read the reviews about this place if you are going there, trust me you will be very disappointed. I have stayed in the carribbean several other times an this is not a 4 star hotel I would personally give it about a 2 1/2 along with a lot of other people that were there. Honestly, It is a very layed back place. So when you land in the airport expect massive delays and confusion. I was hoping not to have this problem because my fiance speaks fluently in spanish. However, that really didnt help. The Dominican Republic is farely new to tourism and the airport in Punta Cana is new as well. So the staff is well over worked. After we landed, there was no direction. Yes, there was signs for Liberty Travel. So, a guy ran over an took our luggage and we proceeded to our bus 9 different buses we went to. They had no clue what bus we were on. Now, picture you self in a parking lot with about 4 planes that just landed with app. 1000 people. It truely was a mess. After 40 minutes of walking from bus to bus in 91 degree temps. They guy stands in front of us and stick out his hand for a tip. Now, believe me I am curteous however when there is no direction I wont compensate. So, he got mad an walked away. After, arriving at the hotel. I would have to say the ride was not really bad at all. It takes about 45 minutes to get to the resort which we new. The front desk was well over worked. The staff members were scrambling all over the place. Our room was ready within 15 minutes. A staff member brings your bags to the room an gives you a little personnal tour. That was well worth a tip. They days were very hot and relaxing. The beaches were very nice and well groomed. However, the pool area has a very bad moldy odor and spell to it. So, we spent most of our time at the beach which we enjoyed. The food was rated about a 1 out of 5. It was extremely poor. There were several other people complaining about bad stomach aches, massive bathroom problems. I honestly could not get used to the food where my fiance liked some of it. The fruit is very good however the actual meals were terrible. A lot not cooked properly or thoroughly. Which, was not agreeing with a lot of people. It would not be an understatement if I said the bathrooms were so overworked that you could actually smell sewage on the resort. It was that bad.Let me explain reservation as far as restaurants and water sports. I just dont get what the point of a reservation is when you have to wait to the extreme were you dont even want to do the event anymore. The hotel has several restaurants. Only one was good (Munasun) this restaurant was actually the only food that was extremely well. If you want to go out to eat more than the three times all you have to do is make a reservation at the front desk. However, they get full very fast so you have to get there at about 9 am. to eat that night which was not a problem. So, for example wanted to make reservations at the Paris restuarant they started off by telling us the next available time was at 9:30. So, we argued with them and she mad a special one for 6. We got to the restaurant and it was empty. I am talking empty like not even open. It was really bad business. As far as the water sports the resort gives you one free ride on the bananna boats. Where the second time costs $10 US. We mad reservations for saturday at 11:50 am. We got there an proceed to find 3 full groups in front of us. Now, for a resort that has nearly 700 rooms. Why is there only one bananna boat operating. Just made no sense. So, we waited over one hour to take a ten minute ride. Along with others staying there we felt like we were being invaded on. What I mean by this is that they let people from the outside to use the resort on the weekends and they also allow outside sellers to come in an sell on the resort. Which doesnt sound like a bad idea. They set up there tables in the lounge areas and near the bars and pool. To where you have to walk by them. They sell all kinds of goods. But as soon as you walk but they they are all over you. Now, I know they want to make money but it got to the point where a lot of people were very uncomfortable. When you said no the next table would jump on you. For example, we stayed in breezes Bahamas last year and this is why we returned to this Breezes because it was excellant there. In the Bahamas we went into town and we went into there shops so you can expect they to invade you we are on there property. BUT unlike this resort they deffinatly invade on you when we were really there to relax anjoy ourselves.There is deffinatly a language barrier. Yes, you have to understand that we were going into a place where they speak spanish. However, my fiance speaks fluently in spanish and she was even having a hard time. There was a lack of professionalism. The hotel room was fare. The balcony was infested with small bugs. At the end of the trip they give you a survey to fill out about the place. And we did and when I went to hand it in at the front desk they guy there opens it up an starts reading it questioning me why we rated to resort that badly. Pretty much arguing with me. In all my experiences this should have been annymous and either in a drop box or something. I know for a fact after he read the bad resort it was never pasted on to the proper management. That is truely poor business. We actually took this one step further and I have already contacted Breezes main department and have filed a complaint about the resort. And they were nice enough to tell me this is very frequent with just that place Punta Cana. I was shocked that they told me that. They said I will have some type of compensation with in a week or two. To top off our vacation, we arrived back at the airport to leave to find out there was a 3 hour delay. This you can never help. We were first told it was just normal delays which was understandable. To later find out the New Jersey area was experiencing heavy rain. We then later found out that it was poor communcation from the Punta Cana airport that they mixed up the time of our depature. We were expected to leave at 2:00 yesterday we left at 5:30. That again is very poor business.I understand that it is hard to get a true feeling of a place before you experience it but do you homework before you go. And beleive me I did and we were very unhappy. And lastly if I was the only one who felt this way I would of thought it was me however there were so many people going through the same thing day after day. Overall, we enjoyed being away from our busy lives. Again, do your homework an I wish people good luck on there vacations. Anyone can feel free to email if they like more information.I wish I paid closer attention to the negative reviews Just like everyone here, I diligently read all the positive and negative reviews, thought that those who wrote negative reviews were spoiled brats (please forgive me now) and took a leap of faith-a family of 4, with two kids, ages 3 and 7. For the first time in my traveling experience, I wish I paid more attention to the negative reviews, but after all, the last resort we went to was Sandals MoBay and the reviews were mixed as well, but we had time of our lives. OK, so let me start:Positives:1. Rooms-this is the resort's biggest playing card. They are clean, spacious and comfortable. Kids each had a twin size bed, we had a king size bed in a separate area, the bathroom is huge as well. Both hot and cold waters were running great, we always had plenty of clean towels and supplies. First floors have patios, second floors have terraces. We were in bldg 84, about 5 minute walk to the beach and 10-15 minute walk to the main area. Overall, I am more than impressed by the room. The maid service was not coming in at the same time each day, somtimes, they would be planning to do cleaning during kids nap times, and then it would be too late, but they always made sure to leave clean towels and drinks on the terrace. 2. Grounds-are vast and beautiful. There is a shuttle bus and sometimes, they are full, no big deal, just hop on the next one, or break your group in two and go. The kids enjoyed the mangrove and the birds, it's very pleasant to take a walk before/after dinner and enjoy the nature. 3. Entertainers-these guys do terrific job. In the mornings, they round folks up for volleyball, salsa dancing lessons at the beach, and at night, they put on amazing shows. We especially enjoyed the Lion King, the Tropical Show and the Legends in Concert. These are young and talented folks who deserve numerous rounds of applause. Each of them is like a mix of a dancer, acrobat and gymnast. Negatives:4. The beach-while the beach is indeed long and wide, forget about getting a beach chair if you are a late sleeper. And, I am not even talking about a beach chair under the palapa, even under the hot sun, there was nothing available! The sand itself is silky. The water can get choppy, not resort's fault, Punta Cana is on the North Atlantic Ocean, not Carribean Sea, so be prepared that there will be days when it might be not safe for kids to go into the water. 5. The pool-again, it's nice and big, same problem with getting the chairs. 6. Food and service-the food in the buffet is served in open trays, so flies are all over it and you cannot help but be disgusted about eating it. The best bet was pasta and grill stations, and the service on both of them was pretty good. The waitresses are hit or miss. For example, for 6 days in a row, they have been bringing soft drinks to the table, then one day when I am sitting with two kids while hubby is out getting them food, I ask one to bring some juice and she tells me I can go and get it myself. Even if this option now exists, it is a common courtesy to help a lady with two little kids! Also, only a few tables have fans above them, so the room is very, very hot. Also, they don't let you take food outside the room, so if your kid feels like having a banana for an 11 AM snack, good luck here. To book a restaurant, you have to be at the service desk prior to 8 AM, and once you get to the front, there is no guarantee that there will be spot you want. You can only book for today or tomorrow, not for the entire stay. They only do 3 seatings per evening and book each rest. half-full. I guess this ensures that a) they are cost-efficient by feeding you cheap food at the buffet rather than give you good fare at the rest. b) they don't strain their staff too much by allowing them to take a nice long break between each seating. We were able to book 3 times out of 7 days, El Gaucho was really great, Bella Pasta and El Pescador were OK. On the last day, we found out that if you booked with Apple Vacations, and you go to orientation, after that, they would book the rests. for the duration of your stay.I was there during the spring break, so maybe when resort is not crowded, all the things I wrote above are not applicable, but it just seems that too many things I wrote about were the same issues other people complained about. And, the worst part is-I speak Spanish well, not perfectly, but certainly well enough for a decent conversation. In Mexico, it helped a lot, we would get a great service before even the tips started flying, here, it was useless. So, to sum it up-I would NEVER return to Bavaro Princess again. I might travel to Punta Cana again to another resort, I heard IberoStar visitors were very happy.We requested they re-slice the sushi, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes.In general, I've never been so disappointed with a hotel. With everything from the booking to the reseption to the rooms to the service; all was BAD. I've been to almost 40 countries, and three times to Berlin, and this hotel is about the worst of all, due to the attitude they have. First of all, it was impossible to get an answer to my emails from the hotel. We had bought vouchers from Groupon, and I emailed all the addressess found for the hotel. Then I emailed the representatives of the hotel's chain. No answer, to any of my emails regarding a reservation enquiry. And I emailed at least 10 times. Well, as there was no other way to get contact, as I couldn't get through by phone either, I asked from Groupon, and they said that the hotel had had some problems with their emails, but everything should be fine now. Ok, so I emailed yet again. No answer. Furstrated, I made the reservation through booking.com, writing into the booking about the problems with their emails, and after that I also emailed the hotel directly about having to have reserved through booking.com as they did not respond to anything. Guess what? No answer. I was quite worried, but as I'd been to Berlin twice before I knew I'd find a hotel in case the Excelsior would not provide us with the rooms. Well, when arriving at the hotel, we received our rooms and the receptionist did not comment anything when I explained our problems. Ok, so all was well we throught. We had reserved one superior and one standard double, and asked if we could have two superiors (I had emailed about that too..) as we travelled as two couples, the other with two under 2 year olds. The receotionist said they had upgraded the family into a superior as well, due to the babycot. Well, when we went into the rooms, our rooms was not a superior, as there was barely enough room to walk around the bed. Really tiny, Italian size room, which we did not expect. We went to see the familyroom, and that indeed was a bit bigger. So it seemed that we had got a standard nevermind what the receptionist said. Too tired to complain, we settled with that. The next morning the couple with the family went for an early breakfast, which was included in our vouchers. The receptionist (a man, different from the night before), said that our bookings do not include breakfast, and that they should pay 18 euros per person for it. Our friends tried to explain that it was included in the voucher, and the man lost his temper and started demanding that we have to PAY for the first night because we did the booking the wrong way. And he did not let my friends and their kids to go to breakfast before they had paid! At this point my friends came to wake me up, I took all my papers with me and went to talk with the man. He insisted that the whole thing was OUR fault, and that we had to pay for the first night, then cancel our booking at booking.com and then we could stay with the vouchers. I explained again about the connection problems, and he just shook his head and said there were no troubles, never had been, and smiled! That clearly we had not booked properly, and all of this was just our problem and we had to pay. I started to get really angry as he treated us like criminals, and insisted that he ask the manager or someone else to come, as he was not willing to even listen to us, let alone try to solve the problem. Finally after reluctantly speaking on the phone with someone he said that we had to prove that we had emailed them, and so I went to one of the computers in the lobby to print out my emails to them. After seeing them the guy finally called someone, and then reluctantly said that "ok, this is now ok." No apology, not even a "sorry", just "you can now have breakfast". And then he went on to the next guest at the counter like nothing had happened. I was so angry I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a four star hotel!!! Other downsides; - the cups and plates at the breakfast always run out, there were never enough. - At the first breakfast we we were asked coffee or tea, took coffee, and then saw that other people around us were having cappucinos and lattes, which we were not offered. Oh well, decided to ask for that the next morning. However, when we did that, the waitress said that the coffee machine was broken, and it remained broken for the rest of our stay. - Our friends asked for more towels on the first day, as they had the two kids, but despite asking again and again, they had to manage the whole stay with 4 people and two towels. - Our vouchers included late check out, but the receptionist (yet another different person) just said "we're fully booked, that is not possible"! - Then, when we were leaving for the airport they called us a cab (needed a bigger one with the kids), and said it would come at 18.00. At 17.50 a big cab came to the front of the hotel, but we were packing the kids etc. in the lobby, and assumed that the cabby or the receptionist would come to tell us if it was ours, as we were right in front of the counter, and the girl at the reception had asked where we'd be waiting. We went on packing our stuff and went to the bathroom, and at a few minutes past six I looked and saw the cab still there. I asked the reception and the girl just said "oh yes that's yours". Pardon my french but WTF kind of service is this?!?! - Also, the bathrooms downstairs of the restaurant were apaulling; literally there was actual brown materia around the floors on two different occasions when I went there. In different stalls. - When we were checking out, we had the rooms till 12.00. At 10.30 the maid started to knock and ask if she could clean, we refused. A moment later, when we went to our friends room down the hall, she came again. Then she went to harass our friends again, about the same issue. She went on to peek into the rooms everytime we moved our stuff or otherwise opened the door. - the rooms were worn, the design was ok but it could be seen that it had been a while since any renovations. E.g. our mirror was cracked. The one and only nice thing I have to say about this "hotel" is that the lobby downstairs is designed nicely. That's it.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Let me start by saying that I travel frequently on business, and have for well over 20 years. I ended up staying here last week because I failed to account for the NYC Christmas crowds, and was unable to get a room at one of the places at which I usually stay. Every negative review you read here is 100% right on! Anything positive you read here is inaccurate and misleading. (I must note though that the hotel staff themselves were all friendly and tried their best to be accomodating. They simply don't have much to work with here.) The simple fact is that this hotel should not be allowed to operate as is. I have stayed in many, many different places all over the world, and have never experienced anything as bad as this. Like a couple of the other reviewers, I too merely needed a place to sleep, and wasn't overly concerned about the lack of amenities. (The last I heard however, "cleanliness" and "sanitary" weren't considered "amenities".) There are far too many things wrong with this place to list, but I'll try. It is unclean - and I mean everything. The entrance, lobby (if you can call it that), the shoebox sized elevator, the hallways, the room (and every single thing in it), and the bathroom. The sheets were threadbare and did not appear or smell clean, there were clumps of hair on the pillows which certainly weren't mine. (It was to the point that I wondered if they rented these rooms out by the hour during the day, when most of the patrons were either working or out sightseeing.) The walls and ceiling were badly stained. The carpeting almost defies description - filthy indoor/outdoor carpeting, which kind of "crackled" when you walked on it, and which was cut out around the bed and dresser, as though whoever put it in was too lazy to move the furniture first. The mattress was as hard as a rock, and also provided that lovely "crackling" sound when you sat in it. (My therapist has advised me that it would be in my best interest to try to forget the details of the "comforter" on top of the bed.) The bathroom lterally had piles of debris/hair/ etc... in each corner. I wanted to wear my shoes in the tub, never mind even considering taking a bath in it. No shampoo was provided of course. I am thankful that it wasn't summertime, because I have no doubt that the place would be chock full of bugs, cockroaches, and who knows what else. I had to scrub the dresser drawers before I put my clothing in them. I lined them with plastic bags as well. Let's see, none of the windows were openable, there were noisy, inconsiderate people coming and going all night long - up and down the 5 foot wide hallways, making no effort whatsoever to try to be quiet. The neighborhood, although not the best/safest, and certainly not what you are led to expect (by hotels or Expedia) by any stretch of the imagination, wasn't terrible, and was convenient to Times Square and the Theater District. The TV got about 20 channels - of these, 3 were in Spanish, 3 were Oriental, and most of the balance didn't come in well enough to either watch or listen to. From the outside, this hotel bears absolutely no resemblance to the picturesque little brownstone you see on the Internet. It is a squat, drab little place, with the word "Hotel" handwritten on the back of a sheet of printer paper, taped to the door. (There were some sort of dead, skinned fowl (I think they were ducks) hanging in the window immediately to the left of the entrance. There is also apparently a place very nearby that has been rented to a fledgling rock band (and trust me, they are very early on in their careers), which is used for their nightly practice session, which thankfully seemed to wrap up at about 10:30 PM. It is also billed as an "Internet Cafe". This portion of their business consisted of two computers on TV trays (or something similar) in the already crowded lobby. I didn't see anything that would render the term "Cafe" an appropriate name for the business. When I returned home, I washed everything, whether I had worn it or not, and brought my suits and ties to the dry cleaners. (I neglected to mention that there wasn't a closet in my room - I was forced to hang all of my clothes on the wall-mounted clothes rod, for all the world to see while the maid was "cleaning??" my room.) I should also mention that this is the second room I had here - I was in the first one for about 30 seconds before I was on the (dirty, sticky) phone calling the front desk insisting on a different room. They were equally disgusting, but at least in the second room, I was able to get into the bathroom without the need to sandwich myself against the filthy wall and slide sideways into it. (I am not a big person either - 5'8" and 155 lbs). As for climate controls - there was no lack of heat, in fact there was no controlling the heat. It was stifling all night long. I peeled off the "comforter" and "blanket" and just slept with the dirty sheet. (Even now I shudder at the recollection.) I am most surprised that this was listed as a halfway decent place on Hotels. In fact, the only reason I remained here was due to the fact that as I had booked the room on hotels, I had already paid for it. I sensed that if I mentioned anything about a refund to the person at the front desk, I would have been laughed out into the street. (Which in itself would have been an upgrade.) The room was not inexpensive - $109/night for the first few nights and then $149/night for the final night. The bottom line is that people should not be expected to shell out that kind of money and then end up in a place like this. If this is the new baseline for price/value in NYC, then shame on the hotel industry. My advice would be to either plan your trip well in advance, and you absolutely can get a decent room in this price range (or even for slightly less) in the city, albeit with a little advance planning; or as an alternative, simply budget a little more for this expense. If you can't afford to spend a little more, you would be well-advised to postpone your trip untilyou can. As for me, I will never, ever stay here again!Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

It's garbage.It's always quiet because it's awful.Nice location but very poor customer service I was really looking forward to staying at this hotel based on the mostly-positive feedback I'd read in advance ... however, I was disappointed.First of all, it's located immediately next door to a nude gay male dancing bar. I hadn't seen THAT fact in any of the reviews. Don't get me wrong - I'm open-minded, but I also had my young sons and father with me and I would have liked to have made a more informed decision regarding where we were staying. Also, it was ~$18/day to park at the structure across the street from the hotel. It was very difficult to get across 3 lanes of one-way traffic to pull in front of the hotel each day.No one offered to help bring in our luggage. The hotel is mostly run by people who are very disinterested in providing customer service (both front office and waitresses). The male owner is emotionally removed from conversations with guests. The female owner was nicer, but can't undo the lousy customer service provided by the other workers there.On one morning when my father had a nose bleed and got a small amount of blood on the carpet, my husband went down to the front desk to notify them so they would know what it was and could remove it with the correct product. The front desk woman was ONLY concerned with the carpet and went into detail telling my husband that the carpet was new and how concerned she was that the blood might not come out of the new carpet; she indicated no concern for my father's condition. For the first 2 days of our stay, our bathroom sink was plugged and water could not run for more than 10 seconds without pooling in the sink. I told the front desk on the 2nd morning and they said they would fix it. They didn't. When I used the bathroom sink on the 2nd night and saw it was still plugged, I was very disappointed. I told the front desk on the 3rd morning and they argued with me and said that they already fixed it by using some special liquid. I told them that it obviously hadn't worked since it was still plugged up and that it was totally unacceptable, and that they needed to do it again and then make sure that it worked. She said okay, and when I returned on the 3rd night it was fixed, thank goodness. There is only one elevator to service the 7-floor building (basement with restaurant and 6 floors of rooms) - an old 4-person elevator (with a wire door) which is quaint. It broke down one day when we were there, so people had to walk the very narrow staircase; I felt sorry for people checking in who were staying on the 6th floor, for my father (who's 78), and anyone with mobility challenges. They had it fixed within 24 hours, so that was good.Every morning there were only 3 things offered for breakfast: eggs, french toast, or an omlet. They all came with a 1/4 cup of hash browns, 1 piece of bacon, 2 pieces of toast, a small glass of juice, and coffee. The food was okay, nothing special. Service was very fast, but servers were extremely emotionally detached, except for the one morning when the female owner was serving - she was nice. Every day, every table had a vase of real roses - they were very beautiful. The dinner menu looked really good but we didn't try it due to our anticipation of bad service which can ruin a meal. One of the rooms we had (of the 4 rooms) had a make-shift sheet setup on the window - the owner explained that the window blinds had broken and that she had ordered some custom blinds and they hadn't arrived yet. So instead, they hung some sheets on a flimsy curtain rod and she said you needed to GENTLY move the sheets over the window to cover them and that if you weren't careful, the sheets would fall down. Unbelievably tacky and unprofessional - I was shocked. Be aware that there is no one in the front office after 11 PM, so if you need something after 11 pm, you're pretty much out of luck....The restaurant and lobby have a Joan of Arc theme, which was interesting.The rooms were uncomfortably warm; there is no air conditioning, and some rooms have ceiling fans. In one of our 4 rooms, the ceiling fan was broken. The towels are amazingly thin (the cheapest I think I've ever seen). The bedsheets were really thin and cheap too, and the blankets seemed old and rough (we didn't use).They said there was wireless internet in the rooms for free, but the signal was so weak that I could never connect and had to use the San Francisco citywide wireless network (costs $5.95 per day). There is one computer in the lobby and they charge $1 per 15 minutes. That's reasonable. However, when I used it to print my boarding passes for everyone in my party (there were 7 of us in 4 rooms), the front office woman was very concerned that I was using 10 pieces of paper to print on, and said that I owed her $2 for the printing. I was shocked that she would act so cheap - I had just spent 2 THOUSAND DOLLARS at their hotel for 4 rooms ! Unbelievable... Again, a complete lack of customer service and no concept of wanting satisfied customers. After I agreed to her charging me $2 for the printing, she asked me if I knew very much about computers, and said that she couldn't read one of her computer drives. I told her that I knew a lot about computers, but would have to charge her a consulting fee of $2. She smiled but continued to ask my computer advice. I was unable to help her :-)I will NOT stay here again - when there are so many other choices in the city, there's no need to be treated like this.first of all, one postivie reviewer wrote 'there are free waffles!' oh god...that is twisted! a disgusting machine in one of the most pathetic depressed rooms you can imagine with gross waffle stuff oozing out. i do not believe for ONE SECOND..that ANY positive review is real. there is no way. this hotel has the atmosphere of a 99cents or thrift store. i swear when i walked in i was in shock. it was EXACTLY like a halfway house that would be on hollywood and vine in LA. the parking is 'free' becuase it is either on the street or in a nasty underground type area that is full. ie--no parking. the interent was free for me because it did not work. although, this could ahve been temporary. if you are young and used to camping out or hosteling it..then you won't care as long as you have a bed. i requested an 'upgraded' room. the bed did not have that tacky flowered 70's type quilt so that was an upgrade. the bathroom floor had a bunch of black, what looked like pubic hairs to me and the tub as well. if i was hosteling it, fine but i was told, when i called , that this was a beautiful place and that the bad reviews were exaggerated or that those people were not in upgraded rooms. part of this 'hotel' is not inside the hotel but in a separate area. when we drove in that evening..there was a hooker knocking on one of the room doors. she knocked for a long while and i called out to her, 'maybe you have the wrong room number!' so she went to check her book. As we went past her...there were some decrepit beachy plastic chairs with some men sitting on them staring into space. It was exactly like being on hollywood blvd in the bad areas. They call the building 'hollywood style' but it is the same as i said, as those halfway houses or other places on hollywood blvd..that you would never go near. yes..maybe the main architecture is there..a giant pillar ot two...wider staircase...but thats about it. my room was wthe 'gary cooper room'! wow...unbelievable. ------------- my husband is the kind of guy who occasionaly eats at mcdonalds or gets a doughnut at ampm . I went with him to the 'breakfast' room. he then said he wasn't going to stay but would leave for work. 'why don't you eat here?" i asked. he said, the food looked sick and he'd pick up a doughnut somewhere. wow! when he said that...it was my triple confirmation that it was not jsut ME who thought the 'breakfast' was horrendous. its basically a basement storage type room, that has the infamous plasticy 'waffle maker' , a vat of waffle 'dough'...dperessing bagels sitting in a plastic case, a bowl of waxy apples. i took one thinking..well if wash it..but the wax was so thick. it jsut grossed me out. when we arrived, and there was no parking, the guys tried there best to find one. (in vain) i felt sorry that they had to deal with things that were not their fault. they really tried though. you could tell they cared. one of the workers helped me bring a suitcase down from my room..so these guys were jsut doing their job.. so, there you have it, unlike the comfort suite inn i had stayed in that had a nice room but horrendous staff, this one had a horrendous hotel with one or two hard-working guys. basically , even if a hotel room had hairs or whatver and the palce was decent,,well things happen...but this place is decrepit....just falling apart,...literally,. hyou could tell they tried to cldean up the sofa in the waiting room...it was a thrift store type couch...but so gross even with the intended clean up...and the table was 70's brown completely chipped formica. as i said these things in and of themselves dlon't make the hotel bad or good..but jsut trying to paint you a picture that if you are looking for a decent 2 and a half star hotel...this isn't it. this is just plain gross and depressing. oh one more thing! prior to coming i read the reviews and a lot of people said, it was sort of a party place. i was worried about that...but when i called they assured me that it only meant that once in a while you could hear some sound...that the walls were not 100% sound proof but in general you could only maybe hear a sound from the cars or whatever. i could hear the suitcases and the conversation up and down the hall so this wasn't true. oh god! forgot this! my rrom had NO VENTILATION! The windows were patsed shut and the bathroom door facing the bed had a big giant square with slats in it. so basically No sound privacy at all when you use the bathroom..since there was no air outlet..they had that giant square in the door so the steam and smells from the bathroom could have a place to go. which is right into your room. that was one of the worst parts of the experience. i've never seen anything like that before.I must prefice this review by stating that I lived in the UK for some time, and have stayed in hostels, bed and breakfasts and up-scale hotels (and never had a problem) in London since 1997. This was the first *and last* visit to the Royal National. I will speak to several ideas in detail (including the petty theft). If you're not interested, just go all the way to the bottom and read about the amenities and key points. The concierge are actually *porters*, so do not expect them to have appropriate concierge-esque (?) knowledge. Only about 1/6 of them are kind and willing to help; many just blink at you if your question doesn't relate to where to find the laundrette or pub. Very, very rude. A friend of mine and I had a flight to Dublin at 6am and required a taxi at 4:00am. We confirmed our wake-up call and pre-arranged taxi with the porters TWICE, as well as the operator. Wouldn't you know, the taxi wasn't there and many blessings on my friend's alarm clock that morning... It can get quite noisy at night, especially if your room is on the 'inside,' facing the courtyard (smoking area by the bar). Bring some earplugs -- the walls are thin! Bring your own alarm clock -- phone-requests are either 15 minutes early, late, or never! Room keys become deactivated just about every day, or every other day . . . you will get all the way up to the 10th floor and, "Whoops!" you have to go all the way back downstairs. Since I was staying there for two weeks (with the group; I would have changed hotels if I could have), I did this at least 8 times throughout my stay!!!!!! On the second day of my visit, my laptop, camera and other items were stolen from me in the hotel lobby. I turned my back to put on my coat and when I turned back - they were gone. The security guards (the only kind souls, besides the wonderful housekeeping staff) caught it on video but were not there to assist because they don't come in until 3:00p.m. Interestingly enough, the same two thieves snatched a purse just two days prior from the same place in the lobby, at approximately the same time. Be warned... Breakfast in the morning is every man/woman/child for themselves. :) Go early...toast, cereal, bread rolls and jam/butter are available. There is also a hot-food bar for a fee (sausage/bacon/fruit/eggs/tinned tomatoes). Bring your own coffee or tea...blech! However, the free(included) breakfast was the best part of my stay. :) If you have sensitive skin, be aware that many people have minor allergies to the soap used on the linens. I know this because I was traveling with a college-student group that returns to this hotel twice a year, and many of the students break out in a rash due to the harsh soap. The rooms were quite clean and, as I mentioned previously, the housekeeping staff is friendly and accomodating. Shirin was the housekeeper on our floor, and she was quite helpful (especially when I had to move rather quickly for security reasons after the theft). Remember - washcloths are not provided in the UK; bring your own. There is a tour-booking booth just outside of the hotel, and a theatre-tickets booth inside the lobby. The location of the hotel is BRILLIANT; just 1 1/2 blocks from Russell Square tube station, and across the street from a bus stop. The British Museum is within walking distance (5-10 minutes). A 'Tesco Express' (grocery store) is across the street from the tube stop, and multiple restaurants are nearby. A laundrette (fluff and fold or do-it-yourself) is about 2 blocks away; athough the facility is small and expensive (expect to pay approx. 7-8 pounds for one load of wash and dry), the staff is friendly. An American-Express office is just one block beyond the tube stop on the 'High Street.' A bank and a currency exchange office are just 1/2 block away as well. The Internet cafe is just a couple of shops away, and the price is only 1 pound per 30 minutes! There are printing facilities at the cafe, or go across the street to the Xerox/film developing shop. Purchase phone cards from the post office, which is also just one block away. These cards have the best rate, by far. Don't bother with the 'America First Gold/Platinum Edition' cards from the tobacco/7-11 shop across the street or the internet cafe two-doors down. You'll get about 30 minutes of international calling time for $10 (5 pounds). The post office card gives you two hours or so. **So...in a nutshell, be VERY cautious when staying at the RNH, and if you frequent the pubs nearby as well. I'm an extremely conscientious traveler (money belt and all), but it can happen to anyone. There are signs on the London Pub, etc.. that warn of thefts.** -Be VERY much on guard in and out of your room -Be prepared to pack your own sheets (harsh soap used) -Bring flip-flops or sandals so you don't have to walk on the dirty floors on the way to the pocket-sized bathrooms -Bring your own coffee or tea -Bring your own alarm clock -Call your own taxis, and don't rely on porters for information -Bring earplugs -Convenient location -Get a new room key every couple of days -Wear a money belt -Hairdryers require 20pound deposit -Non-smoking rooms...ha! :( -BYOW - Bring your own washcloth -Hotel internet is unreliable/phone-card telephones in lobby are in high-demand after 6:00pm I understand that the Tavistock and President's Hotels (also owned by the Imperial Hotels - but are around the corner) are much safer/cleaner. The staff was kind when we held meetings in their conference rooms. Their breakfast was much, much nicer than the one at RNH. Good luck, and Mind the Gap!We stayed as guests at the Grand Velas Resort in Playa del Carmen as part of a much larger wedding celebration. I want to relate our check out. As the last couple of the group to leave, I stopped at the concierge at about noon the day before our departure to confirm the car service our friends set up for us as a gift to all their guests, the same car service that we had all been using all week, coming and going from the resort. The concierge, at first saying he was unaware of our friends wedding party, they had checked out that morning, or knowing the car service, after I texted the groom luckily still in the airport for the contact name and showing the concierge the name and # on our phone, he suddenly knew the service. At that point he instructed me that he will call the service and confirm the pickup and then leave a message in my room with the pickup time. Spending the day in Playa del Carmen and Cozumel, I returned to the room at 9 pm to a note saying “We don’t have any information about your check out, please if you need help with your transportation call the lobby and quoting me two prices for a cab or a limo and signed by a woman. Clearly I was passed off to someone else during the day and telling me that I have no pre-arranged transportation through the groom. The next morning my wife went to the lobby and arranged a taxi, curiously, now even more then the note quoted, as the hotel couldn’t confirm our prearranged outside service, for noon. At 11:30 am, the car service that our friend arranged arrived. In the lobby, we asked the concierge, another women, to cancel our taxi. She spent a couple of minutes on the phone and related to us that the car was canceled, but we would have to pay for it, a charge of $39, even though it was a half hour early and no taxi came. All that was repeated to us was we were responsible for the unwanted taxi. There was no ownership or acknowledgment of how the resort made the mistake of not confirming our car thru the prearranged service. Needing to leave for the airport, we refused to sign the credit card slip, told them we were going to dispute the charge with American Express anyway, and chose to leave. At this point, we attempted to get in the car the groom arranged, but the front desk radioed across the lobby to the valet, in Spanish. Here it gets amazing as a sudden new rule for the resort was created. The valet told us we need to get an exit paper from the desk to give at the gate, and thus need to sign for the taxi. I was outraged, I had been traveling in out of the resort, for wedding errands and trips at all hours and never had we been stopped for exiting the resort. Upon return it was confirmed that not one other wedding party member had to give an exit paper to leave. At this point, 4 to 5 other employees gathered around our luggage and a blue shirted manager individual stepped forward and feigned attempting to calm the situation. He heard us out once on the hotel confirming our car service, and then continued to repeat that we could not leave without an exit paper and we had to sign for the taxi. He repeated the mantra, ‘you chose an outside service and now you have to pay for ours.’ He never acknowledged that I had used the hotel to broach a language barrier in helping to confirm our prearranged car to get to the airport. We attempted to leave and even got in the car, but our driver was instructed not to leave. I demanded to leave, he said he could not let me leave until I signed and then would receive my exiting paper. He said if we didn’t sign for the taxi, then they would not let us out of the gate. I told him the resort has my contact information and credit card authorization on file, so signing for the taxi was an empty gesture. The resort had one goal, for us to sign the credit card receipt. At this point there had to be 10 employees, many encircling the car, several had now moved in between the luggage and the car, and the blue shirted individual in the van’s sliding door, forcing me to sign a credit card receipt. At this point, cornered in my car and starting to fear for my life, I exploded; I started to curse and yell to leave, and was told I could not. Here I was in a 5 star resort and being told I couldn’t leave over what we viewed as a simple mistake, was in my opinion now tantamount to extortion as well, being forced to pay to leave the resort. I finally, under duress, crossed the lobby and signed the credit card receipt, an empty gesture and got back in the car. No one moved, not one employee, the blue shirted individual then came forward to the car and accused me of not signing my ‘proper’ name, and I would have to sign again. As if this is going to calm the situation down at all? At this point, my wife signed another copy and wrote disputed on it, the blue shirted manager said we could not leave until we signed a clean copy and only our name, to his liking! I finally, in fear, signed a copy. We were handed no ‘exiting paper’ and drove out of the resort, we could not calm down until safe at the gate in the airport to ease what amounted to being held detained by the resort until I satisfied their needs. Upon returning to the US we disputed the charge immediately and didn’t have to pay. We were contacted over a month later to refund the taxi charge, but it was too soon too late and we now repeat this story about the Grand Velas when we talk about traveling to Playa del Carmen. I can’t relate the other wedding bungling that happened, but I can relate how a guest is treated once they are no longer a paying guest and are leaving the resort.I can't imagine how much worse it would have been if we'd gone at a prime time!We do a lot of traveling and I rarely write hotel reviews of our stays, but I feel strongly that those of you even THINKING about traveling to this resort should read this and RECONSIDER. I have never been to Daytona. I have never been to this resort. My family traded in a 5-star Paris Marriott timeshare for our week stay. A week alone to celebrate our anniversary. Booking was difficult, as it is Spring Break time... so we got Daytona and this hotel. We were excited to explore the area and relax. Thanks to the Grand Seas and it's deplorable condition, the week was an absolute nightmare and total waste of time and money. I'm not going to sling mud. I will just spew the facts and have the photos to prove. - Upon our Sunday arrival, 2 of the 3 elevators were broken. We stayed on the extreme North of the hotel. Only the elevator on the extreme SOUTH was working, so it wasn't worth it. Mind you, the elevators were broken until Friday morning. 5 days of up- down up-down with laundry, groceries, and 40 pound suitcases. Not exactly the ideal way to begin a "relaxing vacation". - We realized in the middle of our first night, when we were SWEATING to death from the Florida humidity, that the A/C in our condo WASN'T WORKING. The next morning (Mon.) maintenance "fixed it". It, once again, stopped working in the middle of Mon. night. This pattern occurred the first FOUR DAYS of our stay until on Wednesday, when it was 85 degrees according to our thermostat and HUMID AS HE** in our room, management finally told us that we had to move units. They couldn't fix it. Would have been NICE to know that a few days earlier before we went to the grocery store or lost several night's sleep due to heat and humidity in our unit?! In addition, HUGE pain re-packing and unpacking EVERYTHING including groceries. FIRST UNIT THAT WE STAYED IN (in ADDITION to the AC not working): Built-in Microwave didn't work so they had a SECOND one sitting on the counter. Toaster didn't function at all. Safe was not attached to the floor properly AND didn't function. Remote control for the TV didn't work. Tub was dirty and not draining properly. SECOND UNIT THAT WE STAYED IN: Tub AGAIN not draining properly. After several run-ins with maintenance that week who had proven to be idiotic and incapable, my husband finally got fed up and found a plunger. He had the sheer delight and honor of removing enormous CLUMPS and CLUMPS of other people's hair so we didn't have to stand ankle-deep in funk every time we showered. If you opt to use the old jacuzzi... be aware THAT'S what you're soaking in. GROSS! Again, the safe didn't work. The A/C of our NEW ROOM stopped working on THURSDAY NIGHT. By that point however, were counting down the MINUTES to our Saturday check-out and didn't bother reporting it. No working TV remote. BOTH ROOMS: HORRIBLY FILTHY. And I am not talking a little. Scuffs on the walls. Film on the windows. Gunk on the baseboards. Paint chipping. Visible dirt on the bedspread. Not to mention, ridiculously high internet charges (hello Starbucks across the street). Total rip off. THE WORST: If you are a guest here, plan that every time your bare feet touch the tile floor... they will be black. Even a quick midnight run 4 feet to the bathroom. We heard SEVERAL other guests complaining about this. We finally bought a box of baby wipes to wipe our feet before getting into bed or putting on our shoes. AROUND THE RESORT: Obviously the elevators were an issue. Doors covered with rust and unmaintained. Roaches and cigarette butts a common sight in the corridors. The steps to the beach are flat-out DANGEROUS. Crumbling, slippery, total hazard. 1/2 of the laundry machines were broken. When we dried our clothes, it took THREE CYCLES ($1.50 a pop) to get our clothes dry. The outdoor pool so cold there's NO way you could enter. One of the hot tubs SO hot, seriously it's dangerous. The Tiki bar was never open. Nothing going on during the day or night, minus a wine and cheese that was actually kind of fun. Plus, the rooms don't have balconies?! This is like the ONLY hotel that doesn't have them in the area. Everyone just stands like prisoners looking out their windows. It's very odd?! OVERALL: If you are accustomed to Marriott (or ANY OTHER REPUTABLE, HABITABLE hotel) quality, do NOT come here. This resort is dirty, unmaintained, and is in need of a TOTAL overhaul. DO NOT ALLOW MARRIOTT TO PLACE YOU HERE AS A TRADE. YOU WILL BE APALLED BY THE QUALITY AND DEFERRED MAINTAINANCE. PLUS, IF YOU WANT ANYTHING OTHER THAN A ROOM THE SIZE OF A CLOSET WITH A MURPHY BED... YOU WILL BE ASKED TO PAY FOR A $100 UPGRADE!! We talked to many guests. The only people HAPPY at the Grand Seas are those who, seriously, don't know better. This IS a nice hotel to them?! They have never been to a 4 or 5 star hotel. They will overlook dirt and grime and broken appliances. The management responses on this site are laughable. I have BEEN THERE and seen it for my OWN EYES. The only work being done while I was there was to the roof of the Tiki Bar thingie that WASN'T EVEN OPEN?! And mind you, they blessed all of the guests with the BANGING of these repairs at 8:30 in the MORNING. Hope that you weren't planning to sleep-in guests?! A working elevator would have been nice instead?! ~roll eyes~ I feel as though when staying at a timeshare or hotel for that matter: appliances should work, the rooms should be clean, and guests should be comfortable. If you agree, then PLEASE do NOT stay here. You will be extremely disappointed. The Grand Seas ensured that our anniversary getaway was stressful, tiring, and disappointing. If you have even a MINUTE amount of class or standard... avoid this money pit at ALL COSTS!!to whom it may concern, from a family in ireland, about the worst hotel we ever stayed at. === On arrival after our long journey from ireland, we stepped into dubai airport, it was beautiful, even though we were tired and jet lagged, it was our first visit to dubai, so not knowing what to do we went to information, to see how to get to our hotel, either by bus or taxi, taxi was recommended, so of we went, after about 20 min we arrived in a part of dubai called deira, it was near the famous gold markets,when we stepped into the foyer we looked at each other, and my heart sank, it was dull and scruffy looking, we filled in some forms and were taken to the lift with our baggage, by the bell boy i would say he was helpful, the lifts were smelly, and scruffy, finally our rooms on 4th floor no 406 and 409, when i opened the door and seen my room i knew i had made a bad mistake,the carpets were disgusting and dirty, so bad you needed to have something on your feet , the tiles were mouldy in the bathroom and you wondered to yourself was it safe to sit on the toilet seat.. the bases of the beds were also very dirty looking, we had booked a double room for ourselfs, and a twin room for our daughters. double room was 2 single beds pushed together, so when you lay in the centre you nearly fell on the floor between the 2 beds. they had given us some sort of heavy blankets, that you were afraid to touch, my wife took at least 1hour before she could get her breath, with the smell in the room, lights were not working on the walls, by now we were really tired, so sleep was getting the better of us, my wife asked me to close the so called curtains on the veranda, but when i went to do this , i noticed that the lace curtains were missing as well as the runners, all that was there was 2 heavy curtains that were fixed either side of the window, i knew if i went to move these the whole frame holding them would probly break., so we had to sleep first night with no privacy. and people across the road could see clearly into the room. when i lay down i found myself getting very itchy, as if the bed was alive with fleas, this also happened with my wife. after getting up a few times , with scratching myself, we finally fell asleep,, next morning my wife showed me little lumps or bites on her back, i went to front desk and told them about curtains and no wall lights, maintainence man arrrived about 20 mins later, told us he would sort out the curtains, so he used the 2 heavy curtains, and pulled them closed in the middle and joined them with a large pin, this was ok, i thought, this would only be for a short time, but was still like this on the morning of our departure. so we had no veranda or sun during the day. i asked at reception were the pool was located , they told me it was under renovation, so i went for a look, on the top floor, there was a pool ok, with no water, looked like it had not been in use for a few years, actually there were black rubbish bags thrown into the base of the pool, it was totally disgraceful. nothing was matching the photos and the information we had seen on the internet. when we booked this DUMP. the breakfast was very poor, we tried to contact the company we had made the reservation with ,,,, they asked me for my ref no, but the paper with this was locked away with our passports, so it was a waste of time trying to explain, i will be reporting this to the u.a.e tourism board, i know if someone owned a hotel like that , over in ireland, the health people would close it down, thia was meant to be a special holiday as my oldest girl is getting marrried next feb07. so this was our last family holiday . and what a dissapointing one it turned out to be alll because of the hotel we had booked, i have contacted the travel company we booked this through, to see what they have to say, after alll ,,, they are given false information. i left the best bit to last, on thurs we went out around the souks, for a walk, came back to hoel around 11.30 pm, room next to ours had a massage sign over the door, i said to my wife i never noticed this before, and us only next door, next thing some girs, chinese ithink, came to the door and asked my wife and myself if we wanted massage, we both replied no thank you, as we had to pack our cases, as we were leaving for the airport 4 am, well let me put it another way, it was the first time that so many people visited that one room, the 5 days we stayed there/ it was disgusting with my wife and myself one side and my 2 daughters the other side of this room. i will never use this company again, i would safely say it would be better to sleep in one of the parks or even on the street. watch this space later when i will attach photos of this dump, they called it 3 stars, i rate it less than 1 star. never stay here.Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter doesn't mean we should be automatically impressed.We stayed here 3 nights, 2 of which were with a tour and the last on our own, figuring that it would be easiest to stay in one place and not have to pack, move luggage and thus get extra time to see the sights. So, we ended up paying 102 euros cash for our last night. By big city European standards, this was a "big" room. It had A/C, which kinda-sorta worked. (More on that later.) It had a double bed, which you could walk all the way around, without having to turn sideways. The tv was on the wall. There was a ledge running the length of the wall opposite the bed, underwhich you could put your luggage. The ledge dropped down to desk height for about 4 feet, and there was a chair, creating a working surface. There were two corner niches by the beds, acting as night stands. No alarm clocks or phones in the rooms, but some kind of radio, with a very bright LCD light. The double bed was two twins with one sheet over them, and sagged horribly in the middle of each. The pillows were flat and hard. The sheets were coarse. One small twin blanket stretched across the width of the bed. The underside of the bedspread was stained, so I pushed that off of the bed promptly. The floors were tiled and patterned to look like wood and hadn't been swept or mopped in a while. Everything put down on the floors promptly became dirty. We could not walk barefoot in the room, even after a shower. The shower had a raised pattern of bumps on the floor for drainage that made it painful to stand in. The sink had two mirrors, as it was set in the corner of the bathroom. It had no stopper. The stopper seemed to be lying in the bidet, which didn't appear to be working. The toilet ran, and had been running for some time, based on the stains in it. No amenities other than two tiny bars of soap. No Kleenex. Housekeeping seemed to consist of emptying the trash and refolding the towels and making the bed. No washcloths, of course (this is Europe), but the face cloths were dish towels! To turn on the electricity in the room, you had to put your room key in a slot by the door. No key, no electricity - no A/C while you were gone. So, the maid would throw open the windows and let in all the bugs and humidity, so by the end of the 3rd day, those coarse sheets were unbearable to sleep in. The walls were paper thin. Someone sneezed in the next room; I said "bless you" and that person said "thank you". The hallways are tiled with a mosaic pattern down the middle, so any rolling suitcase makes a loud racket - so latecomers wake anyone sleeping. Doors open and close noisily. There is a door to the breakfast area and lobby that can be closed - we closed it to cut down on the noise since we were so close - and people kept propping it open. We probably got 4 hours' sleep our first night there. Breakfast was not good caffeine, lousy juice, spoiled milk on the 2nd day, cereal and pastries. We bought breakfast outside the hotel it was so bad. The breakfast area itself is pleasant - it opens to a courtyard below, that is, of course, undergoing construction. The hotel is on the 5th floor - tiny elevator should be used to send up the bags. We counted 144 steps from the street. There is Internet access in the lobby, but all the 20 year olds were hogging it for their life-and-death Facebook updates. I had to get up at 5 a.m. to check in for our flight back home. Staff is great when the tour guide is around. Once the tour guide left - well, suddenly their English isn't so great and they have "deals" for you. For example, the law in Rome is that it is a flat 40 euro rate for the taxi to the Fiumicino Airport. Front desk guy said no, I was wrong, there were surcharges for luggage, and that he had arranged a minivan for me - only 50 euros. I said no, 40 euros and that I would use the other 10 euros for breakfast. (There are no surcharges for luggage.) One of our tour group people couldn't afford to stay another night at the Nardizzi - they sent her off to a hostel that required a 2 night stay - but she didn't find that out until she got to the hostel! But the Nardizzi had successfully gotten rid of her. Last example - one of the staff was answering a question on how long it would take to walk from the hotel to Vatican City. "15 minutes." Heck no, it takes 15 min. to get to the Trevi Fountain or to Santa Maria Maggiore or to Termini Train Station! It's a good 1 hour walk and that's only if the Italians in front of you are walking, not strolling. They have wine for sale to drink in the hotel, but there's a neighborhood bar/minimart just down the street with tables outside that has better quality wine for much cheaper. And no view of construction! None, and I repeat none, of the other members of our tour had a good experience in this hotel. One person wanted to get a set of wrenches to dismantle the bed frame to put the mattresses on the floor to sleep. The hairdryer died on another. We all ran out of hot water about 3 minutes into our showers. (So we learned to shower fast.) Others couldn't get the A/C to stay on. (It's on a timer - you just have to push the power button 3 times to keep it on.) Another person turned on the hairdryer and the electricity for her room and all the rooms around her cut out. All noted the bad housekeeping and poor quality of sheets and towels. All noted the terrible noise. This was a 2 star hotel. Hate to see a 1 star! And to think that Rick Steves recommends this and actually sends his tours here.Oops on this pick! May 17, 2006 - Just returned from a long weekend, May 11 - May 15 at Secrets Excellence.....Okay, to start I have spent time reading reviews, and becoming leary, almost scared about going to some of these resorts, but in the long run, we give it a try. On this pick, I wished I would have paid closer attention to the reviews! My husband and I have done some traveling, not worldly but enough to know what we like. Same time last year my husband and I, and my twin sister and her husband stayed at the Secrets Capri in Riveria Maya which was absolutely fabulous! Loved everything about the resort. This year we decided to try another Secrets because of our experience last year, but in Punta Cana. My husband and I visited Puntia Cana five years ago staying at the Iberostar Bavaro. I think we must have overlooked a lot of important stuff about Punta Cana. First both of our stays this year were booked as anniversary packages, my sister's being her 25th, ours being 22, which gave us both a big fat zero with this resort. Nothing special, no upgrades, no champagne, (even upon arrival), no mention of it! I thought we paid for this package???? I guess I need to talk to our travel agent! Here is the good-we all loved the beach, the water was beautiful, the waves did not bother us, and the beach is simply beautiful. We spent all of our time at the ocean, very little at the pool. The pools are also very nice, but I didn't get in them often enough to comment. A stupid thing I did was upgrade on my own to a swim out room, dumb, dumb. Never used it....What a waste of money! Not technically a swim out room either!Lesson learned - do not upgrade to a swim up unless you plan on sitting in the pool outside your room! The sports bar, which no one goes to, was also very nice. Quiet, played some pool and checkers... Can't comment on the swim up bar, never got to use it! Always crowded though!Here is the bad - the food, boring, the same thing everyday at breakfast. Yes, you don't have to worry about gaining weight on this trip. Not many good desserts either. Some of the restaurants better than others, surf and turf is now shrimp and turf!!!! Not sure, but I think they had a lobster shortage when we were there, or they are trying to save money with the pending ownership change of Secrets. So no good review on the food. The ride from the airport - nothing good there!Staff- nothing fabulous, numerous times we had to track down for coffee refills in the morning for breakfast. Bar drinks definitely watered down, not frosty at all, thank goodness for vodka and cranberry! We did track down Tangeray gin, but not all the bars stocked it! Most of the bartenders never heard of it! Never had a bartender that was overly friendly. Only once did a bartender take it upon himself to bring us another round of drinks without us asking. This was at the sports bar. Another time at the sports bar, are barmaid just kept leaving the bar unattended to go talk with other staff members. It was sort of help yourselves! Not good policy!Rooms - our ROOM # 10001 was cleaned daily,(one time very late in the day) definitely puts a damper on an afternoon nap, barstocked daily, we also did tip daily! We had the robes and slippers that every room is to have. Plus we did have turn-down service. My sisters room was another story. First, she also upgraded to a ocean view room ROOM 1232 at her expense only to encounter numerous problems. First, no robes, no slippers, cleaning was hit or miss, and on the one day she received turn-down service the choclates the maid left on the nightstand ended up being covered in ants during the night, which the ants also got into her bed, and both her husband and her got bite up!!!! Not a way to be woken up during the night. She made an express trip to the front desk. They sent in someone to spray her room, removed all the floor rugs in her room, etc. This event did ruin my sister's stay. She was never comfortable after this event. Bugs are not her thing but then, who wants to wake up to ants in your bed biting you!! She handled it well though. She did not make a big scene. I think the resort owes her a refund or an apology. Neither was given!!! Nor did Laura from the front desk follow up with her! She never let them do turn-down service again! Both rooms had musty odors - not pleasant. It does get in your clothes.The outside Vendors - pain in the butts...they were pushy, not pleasant pushy. I don't have a problem bartering, but they were downright obnoxious!. We had vendors not only pushing thier wares at us, but requesting bottled water from us, dollar bills for their sons, trying any angle they could think of - it was not what I have encountered at other resorts. This resort may want to rethink who they are letting in! Bugs - oh boy, the bugs, there were some people bite so bad...it was unbelievable. We all got bug bites but we did spend twelve dollars on a small, small can of OFF in their pharmacy at the resort. We ended up buying three, we used it so much! BRING BUG SPRAY!!! They ran out of OFF...high demand!!!!We do tip, but I did feel that it was expected, and really not appreciated. The service overall was poor. I don't think tipping encouraged any better service. They could learn a lot from their sister resort's staff in the Riveria Maya. Will we go back to Punta Cana, absolutely not! I'm not sure if I will try another Secrets Resort! I think they are going downhill - FAST!!!!! Should a secrets representative read this review, I would love a response, especially about the ants, and lack of an anniversay package.Beware of the chili signed food items not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth.My husband and I were just married at Caesar's palace Las Vegas on February 21, 2005. The wedding service and cordinators were great but our stay at Caesar's was very disappointing and terrible. We arrived at the hotel on Sunday February 20th, 2005. We arrived at the valet area around 12:30 p.m., the valet attendants were a little friendly, but could have been better. When we went to check-in we only waited for about 10 mins. We thought that our suite would not be ready until 3 or so. The front desk person said that there was not a room ready, and that it would not be ready until at least 5p.m. I told him that check-in time is 3, and that I needed it to be ready by 4. We were scheduled to have our wedding party, up to our suite at 4. He said o.k. and gave me a number to call back in a little while to see if the room was ready. That was fine, we had planned to go have lunch with our family and friends at the Rio at 1:00pm. Well as we were leaving I sat down for a few minutes, because I had just drove 7 hours to get to Las Vegas. The front desk gentleman (Adam) came to find us, he said that they had a room ready, and we could check-in and go look at it. He said that we could have the bell-men take up our belongings while we were gone at lunch. We thought everything would be fine. Well we got our room keys, and went up to suite 482 in the Roman Tower. When we steped in, lets say that it was not pleasant. It had 2 nice marble steps to go in to the roon, and a huge marble floor once you stepped in. After that the first thing we saw, was a huge stain in the carpet, that looked almost the color of I don't know what. I thought, well maybe they can cover it with a rug. Then there was a huge round table, that was proble nice when they first got it, as you got closer it had a lot of big gashes in it. A lot of the lights and lamps did not work, and there was actually broken glass from a light bulb on a table, not to mention the broke off bulbs that were still in some of the lamps. When you walked to the right where the bar was, the marble bar was very dirty, and stained. My husband went in to the master bathroom, he went to turn on the water, and the fixture came off. Well my friend that was with us called down to the front desk and talked to Adam. He was quick to help, and still very nice. Well by this point we had to call our families and friends to tell them that we would not make it to lunch, and we still had not ate that day. Adam took us to the same suite on the 5th floor # 582 to give it a look. My husband and our two friends looked it over, to make sure non of the other problems were in this suite. It was good, so we said o.k. They brought our luggage and things up, and then we left to get some lunch, finally around 2:30p.m. So, we had already delt with the hotel for 2 hours. We called our wedding party and said 4o'clock was still a go in the suite. So everyone got there while I went to pick up my sister/maid-of-honor. When we got back I had to run to the restroom, when I came out, I saw my daughter open a cabinet under the sink, then she began to scream histarically. Then she yelled" ROACH", I thought I was hearing things, and my best-friend, the god-father of my children began to chase it , and kill it. How bad is that? My friend who had already delt with the hotel people, called down to the front desk again. Whoever answered was very rude, and said that they would send someone right up. After 25 minutes, my sister took the napkin that had the roach in it to the front desk, and asked them what they would like her to do with it? The lady looked at her crazy, and grabbed it, and tossed it in the trash. Then offered a $50.00 food and beverage credit, that I already had. She continued asking my sister and friend what they wanted her to do about it, while I and the rest of our wedding party waited for the person they were sending up. When she got there, she looked quickly, and briefly, and then said I do not see anything. One of my bridesmaids asked her to check again, she said o.k., o.k. meha, I look again, very rudely. My sister and friend went to check out suite 1082, same tower. It was o.k., but I had to go down and get the new keys. So, my husband, sister, best-friend, best-man, and about 6 other friends went down to talk to a manager. Well after we asked for a manager it took about 30-40 mins before she came, and the front desk peoole kept saying, oh, they do this to us all the time. They don't worry about us or the customer waiting. Well by the time she can, I very very emotionally drained and upset. My friend had to talk to her, because I was so upset, I could not talk. My friend proseeded to tell her what we had been through all day, and that I was mordified by what I went through, and how bad it was for roaches to be in my room, and for all of our wedding party to witness it. She kept asking, what do you want me to do? Then my friend said to her, instead of asking me what I want you to do, why don't you tell me waht you are gonig to do to make it better? I guess she finally remembered how to do her job, and what she was there for, and finally offered to move us, and comp us for our last night, that we were going to have to move to a smaller room for. So, in total we spent about 7 hours dealing with our room, and all of our plans were ruined. My whole wedding party, were yelling at eachother, and upset with me. All beacause Caesar's Palace put us behind schedule. I almost did not get my marriage license in time. When I woke up in the morning, I looked like a mess, because I had been crying so much, thank god, my wedding did not start until 4:00p.m. Oh, by the way, they did not refund the rest of my cash deposit either. I put down $200.00 and only used about $90.00 of it, so they still owe me $110.00 for my deposit. To sum it all up. I do recommend the wedding chapel, it was beautiful, unfortunalty my wedding cordinator did not work that day. As for the hotel, I give it a F-, a straight failure. I forgot to mention that the valet yelled at my friend right after she picked up my car from then, even after she tipped them quite generouslly. So, my advise is go the the New York New York , MGM, Mirage, Luxor, even Imperial Palace if you want good sevice, because Caesar's is truely not a Palace fit for anyone.Had a great business/pleasure trip in London, marred by one very important aspect - this awful hotel in Bayswater. Everything to do with it was awful, and I'm not usually very fussy about where to stay. I chose here as it was a last minute trip and availability in London wasn't great, also they were offering B&B at Â£75 a night, good for London I felt. However, like any accomodation this cheap in London, there's a major price to pay. To be positive, the hotel is a 2-minute walk from Bayswater Tube, and is excellently served by buses, taxis, all public transport, and it's a minute or two's walk from Hyde Park, Notting Hill and a few minutes from Paddington station. The road where it's based is in a nice location, with lots of white-fronted multi-storey townhouses, the type that make London famous, particularly in its more affluent areas. But that's where the positivity ends, I'm afraid. The hotel is in dire need of renovation, it clearly hasn't been touched since the 80s and everywhere stinks of cigarette smoke and sweat (despite the fact that I requested a non-smoking room). I was told upon checking in that during my 2-night stay, I would have to change rooms which was annoying, but a necessary evil, so I was willing to overlook the fact that this was stated to me with no apology by the grumpy receptionist. I checked in, and was moved to a room on the left extremity of the fourth floor which was apparently a double - if the two people staying there are both 6 stone! It was tiny and very basically furnished - no hairdryer or trouser press (very annoying considering I had a formal business meeting the next day), and not even any coffee, biscuits or soap or shower gel etc! Mind you, these are only garnishes to me when it comes to checking into a hotel but it goes to show the contempt in which they clearly hold their clientele. The room was sordid and sleazy, the paper was falling off the walls, there was mould on the ceiling and in the bathroom. To make things dramatically worse, I went to bed that night early for my business appointment the following day, only to be woken up at 2am the next night by the very loud lady next door. There were loud knocks on the door every half-hour, and a loud "hello" being uttered by both her and her male callers - make what you will of that, considering that it went on from 2am until 6am that night. I reported it to the desk but was told that she was a regular client to the hotel and considering that my room was going to be moved anyway it shouldn't be a problem anymore - not the ideal satisfactory response I was hoping to get but anyway...... So I vowed to spend as much time as possible out of the hotel for the rest of the trip, which resulted in me having a good weekend I guess! To be fair, my bags were moved to the other room (which was single and absolutely miniscule, but thankfully my neighbours were much quieter). Both rooms were extremely hot and stuffy, even though the radiator was switched off and there was no air-con of any kind in either the room or the bathroom, so they really need to do something about this - I could barely sleep the second night it was so stifling - and this is London in November, what must it be like in July?! In fact I was so overheated I chose to walk round London the following day with no coat on as I was almost rendered nauseous with the heat. And speaking of nauseous - breakfast. Absolutely awful, awful, awful. The only edible stuff they had was toast and small little pastries, no fresh fruit, no cereal and no other options at all bar extremely watery juice which was dispensed from a dodgy-old looking machine. Oh, and tea and coffee. The dinner menu didn't look brilliant either, I saw a few room service plates being left outside rooms, that were barely touched and to be quite frank looked sloppy and not very edible. The final touch was when I checked out, I asked for my bags to be left, as my train was not until 5pm that night. This was not a problem, however bear in mind that when I returned to pick them up, the receptionist left me to my own devices and I was left in a left luggage room to collect what I wanted - potentially I could have left with anything I wanted (none of the bags were tagged by the hotel as belonging to anyone in particular). Nobody noticed when I left either. Oh, and did I add that I was behind the counter at the time and was free to do what I wanted as well? Very poor security there. So all in all, despite the price paid, I wouldn't go near the place again. I think London's private non-corporate owned hotels need to take a good look at themselves and buck up their game, as this really put a downer on my trip. It really is non-hygenic and a grotty little place, and as noted earlier, not for the easily offended or the woman on her own (as I was).Worst vacation ever! My fiance and I stayed 7 nights at the BBP in June of 2006. First, let me start of by saying I'm writing this review now because I only discovered TA 6 months ago and seeing the importance of travelers reviews in helping others plan a great vacation.The Positive:I will start off by saying that Punta Cana and the Bavoro beaches are beautiful. One of the best beaches I have seen. Beautiful sugar white sand and clear blue water. Absolutley gorgeous!!Before I get to the negative I want you to know where we are coming from before hearing my story. Let me just say that I'm not a picky person and am always easy to please on vacation. I don't care about the having the best liquors or if the food isn't all that. I can pretty much always find something to eat at any of the resorts I stay at. I don't sweat the little things like outdated rooms or musty smells. These things are minor and never interfere with having a great vacation. All we really care about is staying somewhere with friendly service and feeling welcomed. We also want to stay somewhere clean and that doesn't mean it has to be a 4 or 5 star resort and have a fantastic beach. We have stayed in 2 - 3 stars before and they were fine. We have stayed at several All Inclusive and Non Inclusive resorts as well as cruises all over the Caribbean, Mexico, North Africia and so on before. I'm definitley not bragging just trying to explain that we have never experienced anything like we did at the BBP at anyplace we have ever been.With all these things bieng said, I wanted everyone know first what kind of person I am before you decide whether my review was helpful to you.The Negative:When we arrived at the resort to Check in there was a huge line. Which didn't stress us too much cause this can happen at any hotel. After about a 4 hour wait we finally got to our room. The room was fine and didn't have any problems there. So we went down to get something to eat and the only thing that was opened at that time was the Grill. There was a long line there to but we didn't let that bother us. After waiting 45 min we were finally seated and starved to death by the way. Anyway, we sit at the table and waited for our server who we though was never going to come. We noticed there were several workers standing by talking to each other and ignoring the people waiting to be served. Finally she arrived after a 15min wait and looked like she was mad about taking our order. She couldn't speak English very well and we can only speak very little spanish but that was fine we knew we were in another country so expected to have language barriers. Which I'm ok with. I just pointed at the item I wanted on the menu and smiled. Of course she never smiled back and about 10 min later she brings our food with that same pissed off look on her face. It wasn't what we had ordered but we really didn't mind. We are not picky eaters at all so we ate all of it while dieing of thirst even though we had asked twice for a refill. We pretty much stayed dehydrated our entire stay. The rest of the week only got worse. When we would go to the bar area to get a bottle of water or soda we would get completley ignored. There were other people sitting at the bar getting waited on. Some come up after we had been standing there forever unwaited on and they would wait on them. It's like we were completely invisible. It was like this everytime we were waited on in the Bar or any of the Restuarants and no matter how much you tip didn't change anything. Sometimes we would finally walk off and sometimes we starving or thirsty and waited it out. At one of the Restuarants one night we waited an hour before being seated. Although they were people just walking up and they were seated right away. The only reason why all of these people were getting waited on before us was because they were Non Americans or someone who spoke spanish. It was like this the whole time. The staff at the BBP were by far the ruddest people I have seen in my entire life. I felt unwanted there and that they disliked Americans. One time that I did recieve a bottle of water at the bar it has been opened. The bartender could have cared less and didn't offer to give me another.Anyway, one our 3rd day I got extremely ill. Now getting sick wouldn't keep me from returning back to a certain place because anytime you travel out of the country and eat food your not use to eating there is always the chance of getting sick. Anyway I ended up having to see the so called Dr. at the resort. I had been throwing up non stop for over 24 hours along with a fever and diarrhea. This Dr.'s office/ hospital clinic didn't have any blankets or pillows or even something I could vomit in. My fiance went and picked up a small garbage can in the waitng room for me to use. After recieving iv fluids and give med. I was finally released. My fiance asked about the bill and whether it was billed to our room liked it normally would have been at any other resort. The Dr. told my fiance to come by tomorrow and pay. Finally went back to the room around 2:00 am and am still very sick so I lay down to try to rest and about 8:00 the phone rings in the room and I had very little sleep from still bieng in the BR all night , my fiance answers it and no one says anything and just hangs up. 5 min later we here a banging on the door and he goes and answers and there standing was the Dr. and nurse who we had seen only 6 hours before. I though maybe just maybe she could have just been checking to see how i was. What a joke, she didn't ask anything about me she wanted her $400 bucks right then. This is the resorts medical center and they had all our creditcard info on file but it didn't matter. Even though the Dr. told us to come by the office the next day to pay she hunted us down like we were thieves and called the room to see if we were in it and hung up and came banging on the door. Only six hours after leaving. We were once again blown away by the way these people had treated us our entire stay. We meet several American families while we were there and all of them were experiencing the same treatment. Several were very ill. Some of them left the resort after the first couple of days. Everyone was trying to leave early. We were planning on going home after the 2nd day and I got so sick I couldn't travel. So I had to wait it out miserably. It really does shock me that anyone could give this place even a decent review. It's like there not taking about the same place. You can be the judge but I would hope that writing this review would keep other travelers from having a horrible vacation like we did.. I wish I knew about TA before booking that trip..Goodluck and happy vacationing!!!My wife and I stayed here - - or rather, didn't stay here, depending on your interpretation - - during a 12-day trip through Europe in October of 2011. We landed in Paris for one night before setting out for England and Germany, and for that initial night, used the Renaissance Place Vendome, which was outstanding. Based on reviews here, and the relatively low cost, we decided to stay at the Ares for three nights on our return to Paris to close out the trip. We just narrowly averted disaster. First off, if you do decide to stay at this place for some reason, be sure to get detailed routing info to the hotel from the hotel via e-mail. We didn't, and the cab driver took 10-15 minutes of trial and error and mapreading to find the very small side street upon which the hotel sits. Check-in was fine, about what I expected for a boutique hotel in Paris, where I've traveled before. The staffer at the reception desk was polite, but certainly not overly welcoming or warm. There was no offer of assistance with luggage, which, again, is to be expected for this sort of property. The elevator is absolutely tiny and not for the claustrophobic. The room cleanliness and overall appearance was exactly what I expected based on the TripAdvisor reviews; very pretty linens and drapery, huge bathroom with a window, plenty of space if you understand the general size of Paris hotel rooms. (Some reviews here say the rooms are small - - they aren't, not for Paris anyway.) Immediately, however, we noticed the distinct musty odor of cigarette smoke, which was disappointing for a nonsmoking room. I figured that the A/C would take care of it, and went to activate it, but found that I couldn't. I went downstairs to ask the staffer at the front desk what was wrong, and she told me (not rudely, but not very apologetically either) that since it was "so cold" outside, she had disabled the A/C for the entire hotel. This meant that there was no circulated air of any kind inside the room; no heat, no A/C, no central fan blowing uncooled air from the vents. As we continued our discussion in French, she told me that "in winter, there is no air conditioning." I'll grant her that it wasn't 80 or 90 degrees F outside (it was about 60-65 during the day and maybe 50 or a touch lower at night during our visit), but October isn't winter, and there's a difference between "no air conditioning" and "no central air." Both my wife and I have mild allergies and we need some sort of air circulating - - particularly if there's a lingering air of cigarette smoke from a recent guest. The staffer's solutions were to tell me to open the windows and to offer me an ancient-looking fan to carry back up to the room. The window solution was out of the question, as the Ares has large windows with no screens, and we weren't trying to deal with insects and perhaps even a bird in our room. The portable fan, of course, was unacceptable. I told her that this probably wouldn't work and that I would be back down soon to let her know. She said that was fine. I returned to my room, and my wife and I thankfully located a room at the Renaissance Arc de Triomphe (which was far more expensive but wonderful) for the remainder of our stay. We left, having sat in two of the chairs and logged on to the high-speed Internet. We were at the property for just over an hour. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, the front desk staffer was totally rigid and unwilling to waive the night's charges. She told me archly that I should have e-mailed the hotel in advance, and she would have readily told me all about the coerced deactivation of the air conditioning. I told her that wasn't my obligation, and since the hotel claims on its website that it offers air conditioned rooms, the hotel needs to live up to that promise. I simply didn't understand why any guests who didn't want A/C couldn't turn it off in their rooms, leaving any of us who did want to have some air moving around with that option. No dice! (I suspect the A/C might have been broken, but if so, she certainly wasn't telling.) In any event, although she had not taken my credit card upon check-in, I certainly didn't want to break any laws, so I handed it over and she happily charged us for the full night's stay - - about 350 Euros. She offered no apology and (even though we had seven bags) did not volunteer to call us a taxi. We walked to one of the nearby major streets, got a taxi, and went over to the Renaissance, thankfully enjoying it thoroughly regardless of the far greater cost. I followed up directly with the hotel by e-mail after returning home a few days later; they didn't even bother to answer me. No refund or reduction in the price was made, and the full charge appeared on my credit card statement as I expected. I realize that a lot of TripAdvisor registrants wouldn't care about this sort of situation, and a lot of people wouldn't want anything to do with air conditioning in Paris in October. Completely understood. However, the point of this review is not really in the details but in the big picture - - the Ares is fully prepared to mislead you about at least one of their claimed amenities (two, if you count the "no smoking" room that wasn't), and if you complain, they won't do a darn thing about it, and in fact will blithely ignore your request for a refund or price reduction later. So, if you're prepared to take that risk, the hotel is well-maintained and in a nice, well-located neighborhood once you find it - - just hope that you don't have any complaints! And, of course, if you like to have air circulating in your room during a "transition" month like October, April, or May - - forget it. Naturally, I will never stay at this place again. In fact, this experience has sadly soured me on all Paris boutique hotels. I'll be sticking with full-service establishments going forward. With the Ares, you definitely get what you pay for - - or in our case, you pay for it even if you don't get it. Lowest possible recommendation. Everything a hotel should not be.This was the worst hotel I have ever had the great displeasure of staying in. I've paid less for a room in NYC and I've paid more, but what you get for your money at this Sheraton compares extremely unfavorably with any other hotel I have ever stayed in. It's not because the hotel is busy and noisy -- although it's both of these -- one must expect this when staying in a large NYC hotel, but is solely the result of a poorly trained, extremely rude staff, who don't have the first clue about how to provide satisfactory customer service. First of all, when I called ahead of time to confirm my reservation (it wasn't showing up on SPG) and asked to be transferred to the front desk, I was transferred to a recording system, and then put on hold until the computer hung up on me. This happened three times. I hope some of you can understand the frustration of this, and the ominous feeling this would give a guest about their prospective stay. So I called back and asked to speak with an on-duty manager. They connected me to a woman named Andrea Williams. I explained my frustration at being hung up on three times, and that I just wanted to confirm my reservation. She simply confirmed my reservation and asked if there were anything else she could do for me. I said an apology would be great and some indication that she might look into whatever the problem was with the phone system would be appropriate. She very disingenuously said she would and hung up on me. No apology. Just rudeness. This is not an appropriate response for anyone in a customer service position. So I called Gary Sims, the hotel manager, and left him a voicemail letting him know about my experience and how it left me very unexcited about my coming stay. Of course, he never bothered to respond. Upon checking in, I found the hotel extremely noisy and busy, but as I said this is to be expected. There was a long line at the understaffed reception desk, but I was happy that my Starwood Gold Status saved me from that debacle. The room was small, but adequate. I noted that the room was quite warm, and immediately set the thermostat to its coldest position and put the fan on high. I then went down to meet friends for dinner. When I returned I had been out of the room for several hours, and it was still too warm for me to sleep comfortably. I like to sleep in a cooler than average room. Temps should be below 70 degrees, or I really have a hard time sleeping. This is why hotel a/c and heat units have thermostats...or so I thought. It was now about midnight, so I called down to the front desk. Again it was inadequately staffed and there was no one to answer guests questions...I waited on hold for nearly 15 minutes before getting to talk to someone. They said they'd send up someone from engineering. I waited....no one showed up. I tried to call the front desk again, but again too long a wait. It was now 12:30am and I just decided it would be better to visit the front desk personally. After waiting -- even more disgruntled guests were there now, and only two receptionists were present at this huge hotel -- I asked if I could change rooms to a cooler room, they said they would send someone up, I said that I'd already waited for someone to come up. They said they get him there quicker. Finally an engineer showed and -- of course -- told me there was nothing he could do. Oy! Back down to the front desk I went. After waiting another twenty minutes out came Mr. Long -- a manager -- to take care of me...Yeah! He came up to my room and announced that the temperature was fine! Hallelujah, I'd been up and complaining for absolutely no reason. All I needed was Mr. Long to tell me that my discomfort was all in my head. I explained it was not a comfortable temperature for me. He suggested I sleep on top of their "heavenly bed" blanket. "After all," he explained, "it's a heavy blanket." (I wouldn't allow this man to run a Nathans Hotdog stand in New Jersey, nevermind a hotel in NYC!) Absolutely, outrageously rude and incompetent. Where does Sheraton train its employees? Attica? I told Mr. Long that since they were unable to deliver an adequate room, I simply wanted to check out immediately so that I could check into the W Hotel nearby -- at an additional profit for his parent company Starwood by the way. He refused and let me know that I would be charged for that evenings accomodations no matter what. After a long argument he finally agreed to do me the "FAVOR" of not "PENALIZING" me if I chose to check out the following day. INCREDIBLE! I checked into the W New York the next day. And although the initial room they put me in was also too warm, you'll never guess what they said... They said, "we are so sorry Mr. Carp, please let us find you a more comfortable room." Which they promptly did...and I lived happily ever...well for the next two days. Point is, it takes so little to make a dissapointed guest into a satisfied guest. We can all understand when there are issues with equiptment or other things outside of the personal control of hotel employees. What is absolutelty unacceptable is a staff that cannot simply understand that all a guest needs is a sincere apology and a genuine effort to correct that which has gone wrong. Stores like Nordstroms, and many other companies have recognized the value of such a philosophy, and train their employees accordingly. In it's New York Hotel and Towers I urge Sheraton to start from scratch, as it will never serve its customers adequately until the replace all of its managers. Do yourself a favor and stay at any other hotel in Manhattan. My mother liked the Marriot in Times Square very much, and I've had excellent stays at the W New York, the W Tuscany, Swishotel's The Drake, and The Paramount. Very Sincerely, Ed CarpA hotel for masochists. I am writing this review a year after my stay only because I've just recently discovered tripadvisor.com. I wanted to share what was for me a really unpleasant experience at The Black TulipLast year I planned a trip to India. I booked a flight from LAX to Heathrow and planned to stay overnight in London before continuing on to Delhi. Just before I left Los Angeles I discovered my favorite band, Radiohead, would be playing the final night of their tour in Amsterdam on the night I was supposed to be in London. I quickly found a ticket to the Radiohead show, booked a plane ticket from London to Amsterdam and then booked a room at The Black Tulip for the night I was to stay in Amsterdam. I was excited to stay there because I'd always heard from my other kinkster friends how great The Black Tulip was. Once I arrived at the Amsterdam airport I caught the train into Amsterdam and then carried my (heavy) bag to The Black Tulip (which is within walking distance from Centraal Station, the main train station in Amsterdam). By the time I arrived, I was totally knackered.One of the owners, Jurrich, opened the door when I rang the bell. Jurrich was as cold as the Polar Ice Cap. While he was filling out forms and finding the key to my room I tried to make pleasant small talk. I was met with virtual silence and tight, forced smiles. O-kay, I thought...'the man doesn't want to talk.' Fair enough...I shut up. (I should point out, Jurrich's English seems fine, so a language barrier did not appear to be the problem.)Jurrich then showed me to my room, one of two standard, non-S/M rooms on the property. Unlike Jurrich, the room was completely charming. I was exhausted from my travel and desperately needed a shower. I pulled my contact lenses from my eyes and hopped into the shower. At this point I should say that I am extremely near-sighted, to the point that I can see only about one foot in front of my face without the aid of contact lenses before everything becomes a total blur. I jumped into the shower, fairly blind, and proceeded to have a nice relaxing shower...all the while, unbeknownst to me, the shower was flooding the bathroom because the drain was clogged. Unfortunately, I couldn't see this...and the level of the water from the shower never got so high that I could feel it on my legs. As far as I knew, everything was fine. But then I stepped out of the shower expecting to plant my foot on dry tile...and stepped instead into a puddle of water. I put my glasses on and saw that the entire bathroom floor had water standing about an inch. Luckily the water had not seeped into the bedroom. I threw all the towels into the floor and immediately called Jurrich. Jurrich came down and promptly started blaming me for the mess. Why didn't you turn the shower off?!, he shouted in a very exasperated tone. I apologised and told him I had no idea the shower was flooding the bathroom. How could you have not known the bathroom was flooding?!, he asked, again in an exasperated, blaming tone, one decibel from shouting. I calmly explained that I was not wearing my contact lenses and that I am almost blind without them so I simply could not see that the water was not draining properly. Jurrich huffed and puffed and made exasperated noises while I basically tip-toed around the room getting my things together. Once he opened the drain he saw that it was clogged and admitted that it was not my fault...but he never apologized for taking a harsh tone with me or initially blaming me.Before I left the hotel for the show, I asked Jurrich for directions to the venue, The Heineken Music Hall. He sent me to the Heineken Museum which is in the center of Amsterdam...unfortunately the Heineken Music Hall is in the opposite direction in the suburbs. This was a bit of a disaster because the concert was general admission and getting a good view of the band depended on being early for the show. Thanks to Jurrich's incorrect directions, I was going to be arriving later than I wanted to arrive. It took forever to find a cab, but finally a taxi came along and took me to the show...I walked in about ten minutes before the music started, which meant I stood in the back of the auditorium with a very poor view of the stage for the entire show.The next morning I went to the lobby/kitchen of The Black Tulip. Jurrich asked me if I wanted breakfast (which was included) and I said I did. As he began to prepare breakfast (which was a good breakfast) I again tried to make pleasant small talk, complimenting the renovation of the property, asking how long they'd owned the place, saying how nice the kitchen was, etc... Again, I was met with forced, tight smiles and one-word responses. Clearly, Jurrich did NOT want to talk to me. After a few minutes a few more guests came down for breakfast and lo and behold, Jurrich brightened up. I wouldn't exactly call him a social butterfly, but he did make conversation with the other guests. Was he rude to me because the bathroom of my room had flooded the night before (it wasn't my fault)? Was it the fact that I am American (again, not my fault)? Did he simply not like the looks of me? Who knows...all I know is that the man was never anything but cold.So, if you are keen on being humiliated or if you are a complete masochist, I can recommend The Black Tulip with no qualms. But if you appreciate being treated with courtesy this might not be the place for you.This is the cheapest 5-star hotel in SIngapore on booking.com -- with good reason! The staff, the building facilities and the service are awful and the only saving grace is the location smack in the center on Orchard Road. First, my gripes about the building. There are no chairs or sofas in the lobby on the ground floor. So when my dad (who walks with a cane) was waiting for a friend to pick us up, he had to stand around for 20 minutes. When I asked the concierge for a chair and why they didn't have sofas -- the reply was "security reasons". So the Mandarin has security concerns, but the Grand Hyatt and the Marriott across the street don't? I'm sure the hotel manager would say the lobby is being renovated, but when we stayed here a month ago, there were still no chairs. The hotel is designed so badly that you get off on floor 1, then take an elevator to floor 5, then change elevators to go to your hotel room. There are two wings which are completely separate towers -- looks like the hotel has bought out another property later and tried to combine the two into one brand. So if you are stuck in the Tower Wing (which we were first time around) then you have the old, horrid, dingy rooms. And if you get the Orchard Wing (where we stayed the second time around), the rooms are better - much better. But wait..... we had two rooms - one on level 14 and the other on level 22 - and you can go up in the same elevator, but if you want to come down from level 22 to level 14 you have to use a different bank of elevators and you need to come down to the lobby level and go back up a different set of elevators. We wasted most of our time doing this! The hotel has sold it's soul to shopping. It looks like most of level 1-4 has been turned into a shopping mall, which is why the hub of the hotel (lobby, restaurants) are on level 5. Chatterbox restaurant used to be at the ground level, but they have moved this to level 5. And there are no chairs or sofa to wait in the lobby either -- they just direct you to sit in the hotel restaurant instead. I wanted to upgrade one room to a suite - but the receptionist said it would cost an additional $700 per night, taking the room cost to approx $1000++. I refused -- for that kind of money I can stay at a suite in the Raffles Hotel! They then offered a club room at $170 extra, but you know what -- the room is the same size, just on the club floor. But kids are not allowed into the club facilities despite paying for it? So what am I supposed to do with them -- give them up for adoption? And to confirm that the hotel hates kids - get this! The TV has news, Indonesian, Korean, Japanese, Arabic - you name it - channels, but NO KIDS CHANNEL. So when we woke up at 7am and asked if there was a kids channel, the operator said that there is a one hour kids program on channel # 7 between 0900-1000. And what was I supposed to do at 0700 -- operator says, take your kids for a walk or a swim! So once again - the facilities are horrid! The service is unexceptional, uninspired and sometimes downright rude. We didn't get our luggage for 30 minutes, and my kids were sleepy after a long haul so I went to the lobby to check. My 6 year old daughter was with me and when she stepped about a foot into the aisle next to the reception desk (but not even behind it), the receptionist, Mr. Tommy throws a fit -- saying that you cant come in here. I asked him firmly whether this was an airport and whether we had committed a security breach. He smiled but didn't say anything. So I asked him again - even more firmly - and then he apologized. All this for a kid straying a foot forward! Imagine my surprise when the same Tommy shafts me at check out time! My bill came to $859.78, so I handed over $1059.75 expecting $200 in change. Now I haven't seen a 5c coin in Singapore, so I thought this would be fine. But no, Tommy insists on the 3c, so you know what, I handed him 5c and asked him for my $200 and 2c change back! Now the sneaky Tommy hands me a 5c Malaysian coin from his own wallet (not the hotel till). I only spotted this later when I had already left the hotel, but can you imagine the cheek of the guy! Finally, it doesn't look like the concierge desk has it's act in order. I had a package waiting for me, but it didn't show up on their system after I had checked in. The concierge desk said they had no record of it. Yet when I insisted that the package was there, they go into the luggage room too look for it.... and find it in like two minutes! Would have saved me the cost of three long distance calls to my Singaporean friend (who was overseas, hence the drop off) to locate the package if only they had checked even once without saying "no". Two good service experiences -- we called Room Service to ask for the kids menu, but when I said I would think about it, the day called back in 10 mins to check if we had decided. And our next door neighbours were making a lot of noise at 6am so when I called to complain, the duty manager said he would speak to them -- and he did! Wi-fi is frightfully expensive, beware! The exchange rate that the hotel gives is horrid - take the elevator down to level 4 and go to the money changer there instead. He usually beats his rate by 2c for a decent amount, and is good to do business with! We didn't try any of the restaurants except the breakfast once (which was good). I have been too scarred by my experience to stay at the Mandarin again. Farewell Mandarin - for ever and ever! The sooner you turn completely into a shopping mall the better - because clearly the facilities are more geared to you maximizing your revenues from retail space rather than running a hotel. The best thing about the hotel is the location - smack in the middle of Orchard Road - so the sooner it decides it wants to be a shopping mall, the better!Here are the many (mostly) small things that built up over time to really frustrate me at the NH Amsterdam Centre: In general, they would give me incorrect information, but with such certainty as if they were 100% sure with their answer. I personally consider this lying: 1. When I checked in, the lady at the front desk informed me that the breakfast was included. So I asked if I still had time to get it that day, and she said yes and that it was included. And I asked again to verify that I was able to get it that day, and she said yes. Excited about my free breakfast for the day, I go to get it, and they guy tells me that I would have to pay cash up front since it wasnâ€™t included on the first day. He even called the front desk (which was literally right around the corner) and he said that they verified what he was telling me. Why tell me one thing, if you are going to immediately deny me it seconds later? 2. The first day, I called to ask how to use the heating since it was too warm in the room, and they told me that if I turn the knob all the way down that it would cool down in about 15 min or so. So even though it had been turned down all day, I did as they told me. 20-30 min later I called and told them that it did not cool down as expected. So she asked if I wanted to switch rooms (which really was the nicest thing they did for me all trip), and so she showed me a couple rooms until we found a room with cooler temperature. I slept that night, and it heated up a lot. So I called again that morning to tell them about it, and she said that the engineer would come and check it out and that it would be the right temp when I got home. When I got home, it was still hot. So I call again, and I show them the instructions on how to use the heating and according to that, the room should average at 22degC, and that you could heat/cool it plus/minus 5degC. They tell me that during the winter it is always warmer than that and that I just have to open my window. Why couldnâ€™t they have told me that the first three times I called? Plus, when they showed me the rooms, the first room they showed me was considerably bigger than the one I was in. Why wouldnâ€™t they put someone who is staying for 2 weeks in a nicer room? 3. When checking out, she asked if I wanted my phone charges on my CC, to which I asked how much and she said it was 5.50eruo, so I said ok. Then she gave me my credit card slip to sign, and it was over 18 euro. Why did she tell me the wrong information to begin with, and why wouldnâ€™t she have corrected herself before charging my card? 4. After opening my windows, the next night I get home from work and my windows were closed and the room was once again warm. So I called to ask that they not be closed, and they told me that they wouldnâ€™t close them again. The next day I get home from work and they were once again closed and it was warm. So I once again called to ask that they not close my windows. Finally, they stopped closing them. I understand that not everything can be perfect, but I felt like they just kept getting things wrong: 5. Friday night at 2am I was locked out of the hotel outside for at least 5-10min. Luckily someone was leaving that allowed me to get into the hotel because they didnâ€™t hear me pounding on the windows. When I asked them about it, they barely shrugged their shoulders and said sorry. When I called the customer service number to complain, after talking to them for about 6-7 min or so, they told me to hold and then hung up on me. I also informed the person the next morning about it, and again, itâ€™s as if they didnâ€™t care. 6. I bought the internet, and immediately upon using it, I had troubles accessing sites that I know were up (ie, cnn ...). So I had to call a service number to figure it out. 7. I asked to use their free internet in the lobby, and it couldnâ€™t access google. So I had to ask to have someone look at it. 8. They told me that they sold stamps, so I had planned on getting stamps there to mail post cards, and when I went to purchase them, they told me that they were out. 9. I asked the concierge to make a reservation for me through a tour company, and he told me that they donâ€™t do work with that company and that he wouldnâ€™t call for me. Incredulously, I asked why he wouldnâ€™t call, and his co-worker (realizing that I was annoyed) said that he would call for me. 10. After he made me the reservation, I asked him to point out where on the map I had to go. He pointed to the wrong place on the map (it was close, but wrong). Why wouldnâ€™t he say that he wasnâ€™t exactly sure where it was located, but that it is near where he pointed? Or why not look it up on the internet that was right in front of him? I know that a lot of what I said above are really small things, but it just kept building on top of each other. I especially take offense to being told wrong information with such certainty. I would much rather be told that they will look into something than to lie to my face. I hate to sound like a whiny American who expects the best customer service, but I have travelled a good amount through Europe and some parts of Asia. Also, I have stayed in a wide variety of hotels (from the cheapest hostels to much nicer hotels), and this is by far the most frustrating experience I have ever had. In terms of good things about the hotel, the facilities were clean and new. The shower was nice. The breakfast was good. It is in a great location (close to a lot of action, but removed enough that I could thankfully sleep with the windows open without any noise). They seem to have at least a couple larger rooms (although mine was tiny). I think that is about it for the good.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.The waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch!!!!!Let me start by saying that I've written a lengthy report of our experience if you are interested, but if you are one of those who prefers a shorter review.... This hotel was awful. As I've detailed below, the rooms are old and have obviously not been checked for quality (see below), only some contain the "Sleep Number" beds that Radisson boasts, the management is horrible and treats you as though "you should be lucky we let you stay here" attitude if you book on sites such as Priceline, and is an overall terrible experience. I am not one of those that looks for much out of a hotel besides a comfortable bed, good service, and cleanliness, but this hotel does not have any of them! Our first image of the hotel was an extraordinarily busy lobby (about 2:00pm on a Thursday) with only one guest service attendant. After a short wait (totally unacceptable for a desk that could accommodate 3-4 GS Reps) we were called over to a small desk by an Asian female who we were later told was a manager on duty. She checked us in silently accept to ask for my ID and credit card. I jokingly said that is was my birthday so please make sure I have a great room to which she responded with a sarcastic (ha ha) and kept silently about her business. My partner and I were lifelessly directed to the elevators and entered a very small room that had 1 very small double bed when the reservation was made for two people. I called down to ask about changing to a larger room. The phone was answered by the same lifeless personality that checked us in, and after expressing my issue, she asked for my room number and what my room number was and that she would return my call momentarily. During the next ten minutes we looked around the room only to find paint peeling from the ceiling and a not so pleasant smell. After my call went un-returned (10 minutes later) I called the desk, was answered by the same lifeless personality and was told I would again be given a call back - all with no answer to my complaint. This time the call was returned after about 2 minutes. I was told that because I booked through Priceline, I automatically got the smallest room despite my reservation being for two. However, she would, "as a courtesy", upgrade the room if there was something available. After two more five minute waits I was told that all larger beds were sold out for the evening but to check back later that night. Having worked in the hotel industry before an knowing that this is a common falsity I checked the Radisson websites availability for the evening an low and behold it had queens and kings available. My partner asked to speak with the general manager , and explained not only our issue about the room, but also the fact that we were lied to. This gentlemen (which I will identify as being of Middle Eastern or Indian decent) apologized for the lie by saying that previous manager only had limited access to the hotel's availability and that's was the reason for the inconsistency. Instead of handling the remainder of the issue himself, he stood by while he had a gentlemen he introduce as his "assistant" checked availability (he did however step in to say that if he was given the opportunity to make money off of us he would do what he could) and then once larger rooms were found he offered to upgrade the room for a fee! We explained the previous offer for a courtesy upgrade and he replied that he didn't know why she would offer this and that he would need to call her. At this point he disappeared into a back room. His assistant Michael followed him and returned saying that he would process our courtesy upgrade. We were then told to leave our original keys in the room after "moving our things as soon as possible." Upon exiting the original room, a housekeeper in the hall asked if we had "messed anything up in the room" with the connotation that she did not want to go in and clean it. He apologized and stated that the only room he had available to upgrade us to was on the noisiest level of the hotel. We accepted and were sent to a room that had a foul odor and a 5 inch square hole in the wall's vent paneling that blocked the electrical system. ( Prime exposure for bugs, rats dust, etc.) As if that were not bad enough we the ledge outside was covered with cigarette butts! We of course felt uncomfortable in this room and notified the manager again by phone, and were told to wait so he could come down and see what I was talking about. After another 10 minute wait we went upstairs to find him sitting at the desk talking to other guests. He changed the room to another on the same level which, as I tried to enter, was blocked by the housekeeper's closet left open with a broom. After she closed the door, we entered the room to be greeted by an even worse foul odor (smelled like a dumpster had been emptied), a dirty stained window, and a view cinder blocks, and loud air conditioning units. After returning to the desk, we were given a fourth room room on the hotel's top floor *which takes to elevators to get to). The room was much better with the exception of the chipped paint on the bathroom fixtures,missing handles on the dressers, broken iron, and incomplete towel set (which we had to wait about 35 minutes for to be replaced) As it was my birthday, and more than two hours after our arrival, we chose to ignore these things and kept the room. The remainder of our stay was filled with inconveniences and overheard constant complaints of others: 1. When we left and returned to our room, our keys did no longer worked and had to take 2 trips on the 2 elevator ride to the top level to get back to our room. 2. We heard several other guests complain about false charges, $100 hikes in rate to extend their stays, and one guest even expressed that his hair dryer was sparking and he felt unsafe during his stay. During checkout, that I could not wait for!! I waited about 10 minutes at the again under-manned desk, while the Middle Eastern rude manager who disappeared and never returned the day before stood and watched the slow progression of guests checking out. I was asked about my stay, and explained my problems only to be told that nothing could be done to accommodate me because I booked with Priceline, but that I should have a nice day! Do yourself a favor..never stay here!Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

We are originally for Orange County, CA so it was going to be quiet an expensive trip to gather a group our closest friends to travel out to Vegas with us. Having monthly comps at the Palazzo we decided to go outside the box and try a hotel stay at Encore at the Wynn. We were extremely excited after viewing how elegant and nice the hotel is on their website. We decided to plan the entire stay at the Wynn. Club Tryst on Friday night and Club XS on Saturday night. This is so we would never have to leave the hotel. I had arranged the whole weekend the week in advance to ensure that everything was set in stone with our stay at the Encore. At check in, the lobby area felt extremely clutter due to the fact that they do no host an employee to direct any one person to a check in station. Upon check in, each guest is supposed to wait in any given line we unfortunately stood in a line with a guest who took 25 minuets to check out. When my party got to the front I told the check in host that I wanted to check in for 3 rooms on my reservation but leave the key cards up front so when my friends came they could pick up their room keys without checking in. The host had me write down each person’s name myself so she can have a key card ready. I had originally booked my stay at the Wynn’s website so I was surprise to know that my reservation rate was changed upon check in. I had to wait around 25 to 35 minuets for the host to fully check me in since she had to rebook my stay and get manager approval at the rate I booked on Wynn’s Website. This was very annoying. You walk into this hotel come to find out that you are already starting to have problems. All 3 rooms were booked on the same floor. Unfortunately my room was booked next to a room that had a barking door, THAT NEVER STOPPED BARKING. I don’t even believe dogs are allowed in the hotel. I am not certain. The room is small compared to The Palazzo. Nothing too special about the room except that it is modern and updated. The restrooms have no vents so when taking a hot shower it steams up the whole room. There is only one TV for the room and one for the bathroom. Which in other hotels I receive 2 flat screens and 1 in the bathrooms. So that night we went to Tryst. We were placed at a outside deck table, when we specifically asked to be inside. The table host stated that unless we tipped him or bought 2 additional bottles we would not be able to be sat inside. Due to the fact that we were going to have bottle service at XS the next night we wanted to keep simple for the first night so we decided not to tip the table host $200.00 and keep our table. To be so blunt about a bribe I was very shocked. I received a call around 11:00pm while at Tryst from a friend that was staying in one of the 3 rooms. He stated that he was unable to check in and I would have to leave Tryst to check in for him. I couldn’t believe that the original check in host did not do her job, but now I was being asked to leave the Tryst night club so I could check my party in. I asked my friend to hand over the phone but the check in host stated that I would have to come to the front or call in. I called in and my friend was able to check in. Come to find out when he checked in, the host upstairs gave my friend the key to my hotel room, not theirs. How would you feel as a guest barely checking in to your hotel room to find that the room was being used by someone else. The immediately got on the phone with guest services stating the room was already used and to bring a key to their suite immediately. It took them 25 minuets. WHAT HORRIBLE CHECK IN STAFF THE HAVE. The next night we went to XS at 9pm to get our table. The table host blew us off and made us wait in line foe 3 hours. Then around 11:30 they stated that all the tables were given away and that all they could do was free entry. WTF right? We had a table reservation, we waited in line and they treated us like crap. I was furious by that time. The next night I check out of the Encore totally sadden by the customer service. I called into the hotel asking for a credit with Hotel Correspondence. They stated that I would hear back within 5 to 6 business days. I did not hear back in 6 Business days so I called back again. They still did not have an answer. Then I called back a 3rd time and still no results. All in all the service at the Wynn, Encore, Tryst, and XS are horrible. I will never stay their again due to the help that they hire to run there table service and check in. I cant believe my boyrfirends trip was ruined due to Table Host who would not treat a hotel guest GOOD unless they were tipped under the table.My wife and I are in our early 50s and were looking for an upscale quiet relaxing vacation spot. The good news. The hotel is a a beatiful porpety with with large rooms, weel decorated, and very comfortable. As with all Mexican resoorts we have stayed at, the staff are excellent and do everything possible to accomidate you. Now the not so good news. The hotel overbooks the rooms because they count on a certain percentage of guests to take advantage of various offers to move to their other properties, the Gran Royal Real across the street as well as their two hotels in Cancun. This practise, depending on the number of people moving, results in rooms that have been booked not being available, or guests not getting the types of accommodations that they paid for. This was a constantly heard complaint amongst guests which was discussed all over the resort. The hotel is huge, about 2 city blocks long, and their definition of Ocean View Junior Suite is if you strech over your balcony and can see a postage stamp bit of blue green water, than that's an Ocean View. Of coursewhen we checked in we were told that the room that we booked was not available, and they offered to send us to Cancun, or to give us another room and move us the next day. We opted for the later. We were put into an Ocean Front ground floor Jr. Suite and decided that rather than moving around, we would just stay where we were. The next morning when I went to advise them at the front desk that we would just keep the room we were given, I we were charged an additional $345.00 U.S., to keep the room which we paid, (according to other guest we spoke to this is their standard practice, although the price varries) Your are then referred to guest services, which are really front men for time share vacation package sales at other Real Resorts. They immediately try to encourage you to attend an information session at the property across the street, by offering you free breakfast the next morning, (which we did not go to) by mid week they would stop us when we walked by their desk and offer us car rentals and trip excursions to attend the information sessions. They also try to encourage you, for a small surcharge to move to the property across the street, or to one of their 2 Cancun resorts, which we also did not do. The guest that do move free up rooms at the over booked Gran Porto Real. Each night we would get enticements to move slipped under our door. Due to the room suffle game, the housekeeping staff was unable to keep upand on Sunday our room did not get made up, but we survived. The food at the resort was not up to par with other resorts we have stayed at, at got real old real quick, it was pretty much the same every day. Breakfast was the best meal of the day, how can you screw up bacon and eggs! The ala cart restaurants were ok but after awhile listening to drunk Americans being rude to the waiters lost its charm. The real kicker was Spring Break. Not the type of Spring Break that I anticipated. I was under the impression that Spring Break involved collage and university students. There were a few university aged people staying at the resort, the ones that were there were well behalved and considerate. For some reason Ameriacan pareents now feel that their SPAWN in the 13 to year old crowd should also be included in Spring Break. These kids were brought in by chapeones, usually 1 mother to 20 kids and turned loose on the All Inclusive resort, and came in on 5 day excursions. There was a consant flow of durnk teenages, throwing up, young girls falling off their high heels, crying, screaming, and putting on BARBIE parades. The young lads thought that screaming obsenities at the lobby bar in the evenings, (which is where guest would migrate to in the evenings for a drink and a QUIET conversation!), was the grown up thing to do. To get away from this, you can take a couple of drinks back to your room, go out on the balcony and be entertained by the gowings on late at night on the beach, some of which was very explicit. Where were the mother chaperones you might ask? Alot of them were gussied up hitting on the guys that ran the daily activies programs at the hotel. "What Happens in Mexico, Stays in Mexico", right mom! If your room is on the ground floor facing the beach, and the beach entertainment is slow, you can sit on your balcony at night, have a drink, listen to the sound of the waives, and count the RATS running in the greenery infront of you room. We quickly discovered why the cats are allowed to run freely in the restaurants and other parts of the hotel. We did not feel compared to other resorts we have stayed at in Mexico that, we recieved value for our dollar. We would not recommed the Gran Porto Real as a place for the 40+ crowed who are looking for a quiet relaxing holiday.I just returned from a one week long nightmare at the so-called Kona Kai Resort and Spa. My co-workers and I were there for a radiology conference that was held at the resort and felt it was best to stay on premises as transportation was limited and daily parking was expensive. Looking back now, I would have stayed off-site. I went to a radiology meeting there, and arrived few days early and the hotel was disappointing to say the least. There were over 250 attendees at the meeting with a general consensus that the facility was less than adequate. Many people only tolerated an unacceptable situation, others changed rooms, others stayed out of their hotel rooms for as long as possible and yet others simply moved out of the Kona Kai. I reserved at this particular hotel from the radiology association website and now I realize that the links to the Kona Kai Resort website have been grossly photoshopped, doctored, embellished and glorified! The Kona Kai at Shelter Pointe in San Diego, CA is rated 3.9 and average for the area by Hotels.com. This is a FAULTY rating as it does not even come close to the description and photos in on Hotels.com. The lobby was spartan, the furniture in the lobby was worn and needed replacement or reupholstering. Upon entering the hallway to my room, it was obvious I were staying in a sub-standard motel that had no pretense of being a three star hotel much less a resort. There were stains on the carpet, food trays left in the hallways, dust hanging from the ventilation grates, scuffs along the walls of the hallway and doors to the rooms. I was in a room and it was not worth anything close to what they charged. The Hotels.com and AAA rate listed for the room is around $89 and yet they charged $189 in November - off season. My room was not only dated, the last time it had been renovated was probably years ago, but it had a strong musty and mildew odor. The air conditioner was antiquated and turning it on only added to the moldy and mildew odor. The room is dark and poorly lit, only a light by the door and two lamps beside the bed. Opening the cheap aluminum sliding doors leading to the courtyard-pool area to get rid of the foul musty smell, only reconfirmed what I was seeing. The flimsy screen door latch looked as though it could be easily opened from the outside even when locked. Also the curtains covering the door to the patio were also stained and torn. The wall papered walls in the room had stains running up it and was dusty. I don't think anyone has cleaned it in quite some time. The carpeting in the room had numerous stains on it and worst of all, the bed sheets were stained. The furniture in the room was old and worn, small TV, few cable stations. The bath linens were no better, having yellow and dark stains on towels. The bathroom looked as though it had received only a cursory cleaning with soap scum evident on the shower stall tiles and hairs on the shower floor. The bathroom had no vanity area or counter space at all even though this was a handicapped room. The coffee pot was placed on a cheap water damaged wooden stand next to the bathroom sink so that it could be plugged into the razor outlet. All the other electrical outlets in the room were removed except for one in the small corner between the air conditioning unit and closet/ TV armoire. This single electrical outlet is not even accessible for the handicapped person. It looks like that at one point were electrical outlets in the room but all the convenience electrical plugs for the computer by both the desk and night stands have been removed. There is a table on the patio with two chairs but it has not been cleaned for a while. There were cigarette butts all over the rocks providing ground cover for the shrubs. My room was no different in lack of maintenance than that of my colleagues attending the meeting. Many rooms had foul odors which were permeating clothing and you could smell in the person's clothes at the meeting. The drains in the showers, bathtubs and sinks did not drain properly resulting in standing in water during a shower. In my room the shower drain was backing up when showering. This problem must have persisted for some time as the cheap particle board stand for the coffee machine in the bathroom had been soaked in water enough to cause swelling of the wood and loss of paint on the surface. The walls are so thin, you can expect to be awakened when the staff push their service carts down the hallway each morning at 6 a.m. Also, the housekeeping staff was very loud in the morning -- they would be outside in the corridors calling down the halls to one another. I could hear the conversations in the hallway with the room door closed. You can also hear creaking of floor above every morning from the people walking around. The worst part was the outside door slamming very loudly each time someone left or came into the building. Very poor room service. Rooms were not cleaned promptly. Often they were still cleaning at 2 p.m. There were a lot of room service trays left outside doors all the time and the food trays would be left there for several days. Overpriced on-premise restaurant. Cockroaches were seen in the dining area by more than colleague so I decided I would eat out even though it is quite a walk. The Kona Kai does offer a shuttle service to local restaurants but it is a Kia minivan that can only accommodate 6 passengers. The wait for a shuttle out to a nearby restaurant was 2 hours. Shuttles to the airport in the same minivan. Makes for long waits when you are at meeting with over 250 people. I discovered several restaurants which were much better than that offered by the Kona Kai- i.e.; Blue Wave in the Best Western Hotel next door, Fiddlers Green (steaks), Brigantine (good seafood), Point Loma Seafood and Juice It Up (smoothies and panini). Most of the restaraunts are a fair walk away (about 1 mile) so bring comfortable walking shoes except the Blue Wave which is about 5 minute walk. Expect to be nickeled and dimed to death... Charge for the fitness center!!!! $10.00/day Charge for computer and printer use!!! $.35 per minute on old antiquated computers Charge for the parking!!!! $10 or $15/day Charge for extra chair in room!!! All in all VERY disappointing. It was a disastrous eight nights in the hotel and although I tried to talk with reception staff, there was great difference. I felt a little hospitality. I was referred to the hotel manager who conveniently was never available when I was at the reception desk. There are three other hotels next door that are much better. Best Western next door at only $95 per night, and the Bay Club. Keep on looking, pass on the Kona Kai. The rooms are run down and the staff were less than enthusiastic about helping. Save your money and heed this advice and the other negative reviews, as they are the TRUTH not the pictures you see on the Kona Kai website or Hotels.com. The positive reviews must be from relatives of employees or paid evaluators. Do NOT waste your $$ here!!”1. September 03, 2011 Front Desk during check in was NOT detailed in the amenities included with our stay and where to find those amenities during our stay. She was even given a $5.00 tip to spark her motivation but that proved to be useless. 2. September 04, 2011 Went to what was supposed to be a full breakfast buffet which was not the actual buffet but a continental breakfast. The host (male) standing at the podium looked at us, turned away and started looking at the ceiling and gazing around the room. Not sure what his issue was. We only heard from him when it was time to collect money. Asked for two eggs over easy was not NO! Not here. Here you only get this and pointed to watery scrambled eggs. So we left but on our way out we were presented with a bill. We informed the host that breakfast was included. He said no that is for the other restaurant. I explained to him that if he was paying attention and greeted us like he was supposed to instead of picking his nose and scratching himself, we would have been in the right place. I do not work there so why should I pay a room rate and walk around and say good morning to each and every staff. I definitely did not pay to serve the staff! I went to the other restaurant and informed Gabriella Ponce the manager and she appeased the situation by inviting us for lunch. We ate at Atlantico Restaurant. The Mahi Mahi salad was good but the french fries were disgusting. Service from Yuri was good. Wanted to rent a car from Hertz in the hotel but the lady at the counter was more interested in eating and talking on the phone rather than wanting to rent a car. So I called Enterprise at the Conrad Hotel and they took care of it right away. Will NEVER rent from Hertz again until I die. Even if they give a free car I will never use them. September 04, 2011, Jose the manager on duty gave us two coupons for free drinks. He told us that we can redeem them for two drinks, complimentary of Rums of Puerto Rico. Very nice of Jose. Coupon numbers: 248683 and 248682. September 05, 2011 we went to the bar in the lobby and ordered an Oasis Breeze which was recommended by Jose the bartender. Drinks were made and bill was presented. I presented the coupon and he started making a big deal of the situation in front of all the other guests. He said that the coupon is not valid for special drinks and can only be used for "other rum" and not the good rum. So jose gave us a "slap" in the face by offering us third class quality liquor as a gesture to appease and set a positive tone towards a very negative Check in and overly horrid morning on the second day. Jose called the Bar Manager Joel Joel immediately said very loudly that those tickets are not for special drinks. They are only for Pina Coladas and those type of drinks. So with that we told Joel that he can keep his drink and we left the bar. We called for the manager on duty and Heydsha who was a supervisor came by. She wanted us to move to her office to talk but we were already comfortable in the lobby sofa. We told her of the situation and gave the coupons back. She offered to give us the drink, however, we REFUSED! We do not any freebees from the hotel. We are not poor and we will not be insulted by Hilton in the manner we have been the last few days. HILTON, you can keep your drinks and coupons and use them on yourself or other guests. What you have done is highly insulting. September 05, 2011, I called down to Valet like I was told the night before if I wanted my car. 20 min later I showed up at the lobby and the valet guy was sitting there cleaning his nails. Mark was having a casual conversation and talking to another employee. I saw not cars being pulled in or out and bellmen were all standing around the desk by the parrots. I asked for my car and he showed me the key and said, is this it? I said yes but why is the car not here???? " Well we are very busy Sir and there are other cars in front of you. Mark stepped in and said "it is very busy today." So this leads me to believe that cleaning ones nails and talking to employees is considered busy. No worries, I noted it down. As I did, Mark saw me write it down and he started to act sweet and say it will be here in a few minutes and so on acting like nothing was wrong. The car took forever to arrive. Later that day, I arrived back and dropped the car of to valet and it took a short while for someone to come to the car. They gave me a ticket and took no info down and left with the car without any words. This morning when I had breakfast, I asked Euclid to cook my eggs with butter only and no oil. He gave the most dirtiest face and starting demanding at the top of his lungs for me to go and get him some butter from the buffet table next to the honey and fruits. Finally his partner, whom I think was also Jose, calmed him down and basically told him to shut up. His partner got the butter and cooked my eggs for me. The freshly squeezed orange juice machine was not working and broken. There were several other guests complaining on Euclids behavior towards them and so that made the "made to order" line very long. I had a good experience with Leo in the Il Gardinia Restaurant. Employees to recognize on a positive note: Michelle in Room Service, Gabriella Ponce, Leo, Jose in the breakfast buffet, Jose in security, Jimenez the police officer. After housekeeping cleaned our room on September 05, 2011, the room was still filthy. My wife got her hair done at the spa. The receptionist at the Spa is very moody and rude but the lady that worked on my wife's hair was excellent.This was the absolute worst and most atrocious hotel that I have ever stayed in. It was literally frightening. I booked a “family room” package, which consisted of two rooms on the same floor in close proximity. I did this because I was told by hotels.com that it was forbidden to have more than two people per room for security reasons. Upon arriving at the hotel, I discovered that I was given one room that was supposed to house four people (a “quad room”). The room was absolutely horrifying: no lock on the door, dirty soaps stacked for new use (I found a hair on one of them), no toilet paper holder, light switches that didn’t work, a wall heater that was precariously dangling at a 45 degree angle until it finally fell off, 4 gaping holes in the wall, a dirty shower, dysfunctional toilet, dirty windows, cracked floor tiles, and a phone with no dial tone. We called hotels.com immediately, and were promised a new “quad room,” despite our original reservation for a “family room.” The fact that hotels.com called down to the front desk for us, but refused to acknowledge the fact that we received one room instead of two, was the most infuriating part of our check-in process. I was on hold for at least 15 minutes; I could have stayed in the Savoy Hotel for the price of my useless phone call. The new room that we were given looked like a low-end dorm room: 4 twin beds in a line under a chipped and peeling faux-wood grade headboard, broken bathroom tiles, no door handle on the entry door, an uncloseable window, no toilet paper holder, dysfunctional toilet and sink, no light source, where else can I take this! Beware, o potential client, room 503 may have a view of chimneys and TV antennas with a partial image of the London Eye in the distance, but that moleskin door handle came from yours truly! It’s probably still up there for the next customer, but if not, grab the room numbers with your fingernails to help close the door when leaving. Don’t even get me started on the stairs – they were narrow, uneven, lumpy, cramped. If there were a fire, you would end up at the bottom of one of the many stairwells with a broken ankle. Out of the kindness of the hotels heart (haha), breakfast was provided in the basement (Steven King, what a book you could write on this place!) One of my fellow travelers had to leave the basement because of its low-lingering clouds of burnt toast, loud ethnic music, and dim lighting – she had a panic attack, the first one out of a twenty-day vacation. The breakfast served was sliced white bread, a toaster, rancid lunchmeats, and coffee or tea. The only thing we were willing to stomach was the coffee. On our last morning at the hotel (thank god it was only three nights), we accidentally woke up a sleeping patron on the fifth floor, who was fast asleep on the dirty carpet of the hallway. Before you blame this experience on us six “pampered” women who don’t know how to book a hotel, two other groups/guests were thrown into the same predicament: they booked a “family room” and were expecting two rooms, but were instead greeted with a smelly and dirty quad room, as were we. One of the groups was a Chemistry teacher and his three students that were addressing Parliament; another was a family from Sweden. All of the guests in this hotel were first-time clients there, and swore that they would never come back. Two of my fellow travelers in a different room said that their door supposedly locked but would pull open occasionally; for safety, they put their suitcases in front of it just in case. Every time somebody opened a door across the hall or in another part of the fifth floor, it sounded like someone was rattling the keys in your door, trying to get in. To be honest, the Ascot Hyde Park Hotel would be great for Halloween fright night for a bunch of drugged-out teenagers. The hotel looks more like the lowest-grade youth hostel one could find, but with an astronomical price tag. I wouldn’t stay here even if I was paid, and would never wish these circumstances on a most despised enemy. Hotels.com lied to us when we booked the hotel, telling us that we would receive two rooms. Their customer assistance personnel felt that they were assisting by getting us yet another quad room, but failed to acknowledge that we weren’t supposed to have that style of room in the first place. Beware of the photo on the website – it is an image of the façade of the building adjacent to the hotel. The only part of the photo that is the hotel is the small awning that appears in the lower right hand corner, that reads “Ascot.” What you are seeing is a view of a restaurant next to the hotel. Please, do yourself a favor, and never stay in this hotel.The appetizers are ok, but the service is slow.As we waited I watched 3 seperate groups of diners discuss how dissapointed they also were.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.I've stayed at a few resorts including a real 5 star. This is not a 5 star resort. 3 at best. Look into my profile and you will see that I always write a review and this is the only time I was really dissappointed with a resort. Three of our group stayed at a 3 star in Cozumel the week before and rated it much better than this resort. I went with 30 friends to this resort, they were the only reason I had fun. Because this resort is so big, everyone would get seperated during the day and would meet up occasionally to tell the others where everyone was. The halls are banged up from the housekeeping carts and make the building look rough. I did notice a few people walking around and pointing at things which I assume were management checking things. I guess because they see them everyday they just stopped noticing the little problems. Housekeeping is a joke. We had a cigarette butt outside our door everyday the entire week. We don't smoke. We just watched to see when they would clean the halls. I wonder if it's still there? The only time they re-filled our fridge was when we asked, and they may have made our bed but they didn't take the dirty glasses from the bar. Nor did they refill the shampoos until the second last day. Most of the staff speak very little english so it's hard to communicate. For a 5 star there should be no problems with the language in the restaurants. I know a little spanish so I was OK but some people had a hard time. One member of our group had knee surgery before Christmas. With all the walking he had to do to get around he ended up having to ice his knee down the last few evenings instead of joining us in the Sports bar. These great trams they talk about...if you can catch one. If you happen to see one coming your way and you want to catch it, stand in the middle of the road to force it to stop. We had them pass us a few times and when we yelled ALTO (stop in spanish) and the driver just laughed like it was a joke. There were only a few people on the tram and more than enough room for us. I will admit the food is good but not worth the line-ups. Because you can't make reservations the first day, when everyone arrives they have no choice but to go to the buffet. So do the people who could not get dinner reservations for that day because they happened to sleep in on their vacation instead of going to the conserige for 7am! Shame on them! By 9am all restaurants are taken. This also doesn't include people who go on excursions and get back hungry. If you walk over to the a la carte restaurants you will see empty tables, you just can't use them. This is the only ai resort I have ever been to that has extra prices on all the menus. I can understand for Lobster, Wines, Champaines etc but even the room service menu had a charge. $12.00 to order room service!!!! I can understand that if there was someplace else to eat but there is no 24 hour restaurant, Bars yes - drink as late as you want, but no restaurants like all other 5 star resorts (unless you want to pay), so if you are arriving late, get something to eat somewhere else before you go to the resort. What part of "All Inclusive" do they not understand? When you arrive you will get a map of the resort which has all the restaurants on it and the hours it is open. The first one we received showed the Midnight Buffet was opened until 2am. On our second day my husband and I went to the Midnight buffet at 12:30am only to be told they were closing. When we complained we were told we could have Cheeseburgers OR Nachos. When we went to the front desk the next day to find out what was happening they showed us a new map that said "Midnight Snack" and it was now only opened until 1am. If you don't like you room they have no problem changing you to a new room. It's like musical rooms there with everyone changing rooms because they made a mistake! We asked for a King sized bed and were given two doubles (there not queen sized beds - we have a queen and that's not what we were given) We changed to a new room the next day and while I was packing for our move, some people came to check the room I was in as they were interested in changing into it. Two single women who asked for two beds and were given a king size. Go figure... When you get into you room, make sure you get everything you were suppose to. We had to ask for the robes, slippers and beach towels that we were suppose to get with our package. Also check both end of the building your in. When we were taken to the building on our first day by the tram with our luggage we passed a desk that we thought was the conserige. it wasn't, it was the Nolious tour guy who was never there when ever we walked past the desk. We didn't find the conserige until the second last day of our stay when I went with a friend to her room for something. There is a beach with beautiful sand but the water isn't the beautiful blue you expect. The resort can't help this - that's nature. but you should be warned. Also don't use the dive shop at this resort. They are an accident waiting to happen. My husband and a few other friends went for a dive. My husband is certified and knew enough to check his equipment before going into the water. Good thing he did as there were a few small problems which he fixed before going in. The friends he was with weren't so lucky. One guy had his air tank start to float away from him after he was in the water. My husband who is by far from being a Dive master, took charge of his friends to make sure they all came back safely. Checked the equipment to make sure it was safely secured on them and kept and eye on them in the water. He said later he had never felt so unsafe on a dive and made sure the guys he was with didn't go too deep in case of trouble. There are a few good things about this resort. The sports bar was fun and the staff there were great. The lounge by the a la cartes was pretty. The little animals were cute. That's about it. If I had never been to a 5 star before I would think this was a pretty good resort. If I had never been to any resort before I would think this was a great resort. I would never go here again, nor would I recommend this resort to anyone until they lower the rating and the price to a more realistic level.Catamaran Hotel was actually recommended by a friend that have stayed w/them before. Sad to learn and say though that, that friend has no taste at all or cannot tell the difference between the Nice and not Nice. The minute I pulled my car in the parking lot to check-in I had the feeling that I will not enjoy my stay here and I was totally correct. The Front Desk Clerks are not very friendly, inefficient and does not give the correct answer to questions given to them. Anyway, As I enter the room assigned for me I got really upset because the room smells as if someone took a dumb in the bathroom and to be honest I think someone did and of course smells will stay when there‘s no vent or exhaust fan in the toilet. The room was literally DIRTY UNMADE!!! Kitchen was dirty!!! had lots of crumbs on kitchen counter and floors. So I started to scrutinized the whole room and found the flaws one after the other. In the Bedroom, the bed was just haphazardly made. Some pillows that I think belongs to the bedroom were in the living room, the edge of the dresser in the bedroom was sticky and so did the Flat screen TV I was guessing a family w/little kids stayed here. The sliding glass door in the bedroom was broken! Then the sliding glass door in the living room from the outside/inside was dirty, again sticky w/hand marks of little kids. To be honest, I’m not a fuzzy person and I hate to complain if the problem was minor and I don’t really will make a fuzz or make a big deal about it but then I was thinking wait a minute… I am paying for this room $350 a night I have to be comfortable at least. I called the front desk to ask to be move to a different room but the answer I got was they don’t have and I understand that because it was Holiday and they might probably sold out so I said ok. The funny thing is that the clerk on the other end of the wire did not even exert some effort at all to ask why, you know…to at least find out if there is a problem on my side you know... If I even like the room or not. I took one more look of the room and decided I really have to complain about it because it’s not right. Called Front Desk again and finally told them the problems in the room and demand to be move or I will just check out. Suddenly they have the room for me when they hear the scenario I was having in the room and so I ask for the room facing the bay at the first level (and Literally ask for the rate of it) and I was actually given a standard king one but before that happened I also asked how much was the room I was actually told by Sara that it’s okay it’s “COMPLIMENTARY” (but not “COMLIMENTARY UPGRADE“ did she forget to mention the word UPGRADE? I don‘t think so!) so I just said Thank You! Then I was told that the room will only be ready in about 20 minutes and should go down to Front desk in 20 minutes to pick up the key card for the room they’re moving me to, I said that’s fine. After 20 minutes I went down to the reception and was given the key card and also was told to wait another 25 minutes so I said ok again besides, what else can I do? 25 minutes lapsed I went over the front desk again to ask if the room is ready and Kelsey said, room is not ready yet and cannot give certain time when it will be ready because only computer will know if room is ready so it means that, if it doesn’t show up on their computer telling them the room is ready or not anytime that day I may just have to stay waiting at lobby I told her that I was told in 25 minutes it will be ready she answered me the same answer but this time looking annoyed with me. While I was waiting I decided to call the Hotel Del Coronado because I was so unhappy with what’s going on, it just ruined my short San Diego get away, before my call get picked up Sara waved at me from front desk saying that the room is ready, finally! I accessed the standard king room facing the bay small but way okay than the room given the first time and again, I must say that this hotel have a very poor housekeeping . Housekeeping overlooked so many things when it comes to cleaning, I believe that they only clean whatever is visible to their eyes, I don’t think they put effort in what they do because behind both night tables I found empty bags of cookies & chips. At night I woke up w/itching torso something bit me so the next day I put the tag on the bed to change the linens. I passed by at the front desk again to ask if I need to inform them for the housekeeping to clean the room because I was going out to check the Hotel del Coronado that day , the receptionist wasn’t looking at me when I approached her for questions instead engaging words with me while her eyes were glued to her computer while asking me of my room no. after answering her question she made me another key card I did not ask for key card my question was if housekeeping will clean the room automatically without me informing any of them at the front desk she naturally was not paying attention. Since I was so disappointed from the beginning I checked in I decided not to use anything in the hotel except for the room. To be honest my mind was actually set to get a nice massage in their spa and have dinner in their restaurant but because of all the problems I have encountered, the drawn agenda that I had totally changed that very moment. The next day, I drove to Hotel Del Coronado to get a room over there which unfortunately did not happen because they are totally sold out I believed them because they were packed and guests’ seems all happy as I gave myself a little tour of the area. I don’t want to drive back and forth that day from San Diego to Los Angeles so, I just made the most of my 2 days here in this crappy hotel cooped up in the most ugly room I have ever stayed in a hotel in my whole life. In fairness to them the only good thing I could say about this hotel is their location it’s by the bay but wasn’t able to use because the weather did not permit it. It was cold to even sunbathe and by the time the sun came out it was about time for me to check out. At the time of check-out the confusion began, I question the bill because I remember Sara told me it was Complimentary the first night because of the inconvenience I was put through but no, the clerk that’s checking me out insisted that it was not complimentary and later on she said oh, it was complimentary upgrade but I told her you guys weren’t specific because I wasn’t told that way I was told the other way. I was really devastated but because I just want to leave the place already I just paid the freaking bill and promised myself to not ever set foot in this ugly crappy place ever again. Sorry Folks so upset that i forgot to take pictures of the problems and of course, who wants to remember a crappy place like this one not me for sure! By the way, you don't want to have a room next to the restaurant because you won't be ab;e to have a good sleep because of the noise that's what happened to me I was up until 3 am. Just remember, DO NOT STAY IN THIS CRAPPY PLACE OR YOU WILL HAVE A CRAPPY STAY!!!The staff is arrogant, the prices are way high for Brooklyn.Myself and my partner (we are two men) arrived at 2.30pm on Saturday where we were told that only a twin room was available and for that we would need to pay £15 extra per night. We said that we were happy with a double bed which we had booked and a call was then made by the receptionist and we were told that we had to stay ‘down the road’. We asked if the room was the same standard and that it was all Ok and we were advised that ‘yes it was a very good room and we had to stay there because the Corbigoe was full’ (despite being offered a twin room and a vacancy sign showing on the door). We were taken to The Park Hotel on 64 Belgrave Road and were taken to a room 4 floors up (very steep stairs) – Room 14. This room was a very small room with a standard double bed. The room did not have any wardrobe or hooks – so in fact no-where to hang clothes, no cupboards, drawers or shelves so no-where to place anything. The bed was made up with a single sheet on the double bed so only half the bed was covered and the mattress was exposed. A thin blanket and a sheet lay on the bed. There was one towel, one mug (unwashed), one spoon, coffee, tea and no sugar in the room. We were unable to unpack or hang our clothes so spent the night getting ready stepping over our cases. The kettle would not fit under the tap so we could only fill it by scooping water from the dirty mug. The kettle then could only be plugged in on a plug half way up the wall and the kettle had to be held whilst being boiled. We went to Reception and asked to change room and was advised that nothing was available. We asked for the bed to be remade with a double sheet as we did not wish to lay on an exposed mattress, we were told there was nothing wrong with the bed and the sheets were changed only once per stay – after a lot of arguing we finally got a sheet and made the bed ourselves. We asked for an extra towel and again was told we could not have one, the towels were only given out once per stay, we tried explaining it was not reasonable to expect us both to use the same towel and after much arguing finally we got an extra towel, the same went for the mug. The receptionist was extremely rude and unhelpful and made it very hard for us to get these extra items, we asked to speak to a manager but was advised one would not be available until Monday am. When we returned to the room a few minutes later the receptionist burst into the room without knocking and said; ‘sorry sirs you are right the room is terrible, I will get you a refund, the fu~~ing cleaner did not do his job properly, tomorrow I will F~~k him F~~k him..... we were completely shocked by this outburst. The receptionist continually apologised agreeing the room was disgusting and said that tomorrow (Sunday) he would get us a better room and a refund for Saturday, he had also brought with him an open plate of sugar which contained dirty bits. We had an unpleasant nights sleep in what was a dirty cold room and showered in a disgusting mouldy shower. We could only sit on the toilet sideways as our legs would not fit in front of us. That night we returned to the hotel at separate times. My partner came in and went to bed taking the key from reception (we had to leave the key at the desk when going out). I returned at 4am and after knocking continually at the Reception window the receptionist got out his bed which was made on the reception floor and advised me I could not have a key to get in but I must wake up my partner to get in my room– which I therefore did. The following morning we chose not to have breakfast at the hotel as we did not feel satisfied that the food hygiene would be up to standards as the room certainly as not. We spoke to the same receptionist in the morning and again he apologised and said we must speak with the manager on Monday morning (Mr S...?) and he would arrange a refund for us. In the meantime he had said that he had arranged for us to return to our original hotel to a larger room with a wardrobe so we could hang our clothes – all was to be in order and waiting for us. We walked back to the Corbigoe with our luggage and was told by the receptionist that we had to pay £15 extra for the room! By this time I was really annoyed and made it clear i would not be paying anymore. We were then taken to a room on the 3rd floor – room 13. This room was larger with a wardrobe and contained 3-beds. The room was still dirty and the beds made with just a single sheet on the mattress, it was again a disgusting room , however we could hang our clothes. The beds that night were extremely uncomfortable and the towel rail fell off the wall, the Tv only had 4 working channels. During our stay I noted that every fire door was propped open and I advised the receptionist that this was not correct as the fire doors should remain closed to prevent the spread of fire, the receptionist would not accept this and said they were left open to let people in/out. This therefore gave us grave concern as we were up on the 4th floor and our only means of escape in the event of a fire was down the one set of stairs where all the doors were constantly propped open! I also noticed that some fire extinguishers required a re-service this month. That night I returned to the hotel before my partner (who had the key on him) and asked the receptionist for a spare key, he told me ‘no’ and that i had to get the key from my partner. Not being happy I insisted he opened the door with a master key to let me in, finally he gave me a key but said I must return it immediately after unlocking my door, I said NO as I did not wish to walk up/down 4 flights of steep stairs, and reluctantly he followed me up to take back the key. Again we chose not to take breakfast at the hotel. I explained to the receptionist that i wished to have a written confirmation of my complaints which he refused to give. He said i must speak with the manager but the manager was away on holiday. I have photos which I can send you showing all the above mentioned faults should you wish. I am an operations Manager for a Warner hotel so I did realise that @£50 per night we would be not be getting large rooms or anything special in London – we just wanted a clean place to sleep, shower and take breakfast;, however we did expect a clean room and bed, towels, blankets and sheets and to stay in the hotel we had booked and not get treated rudely. We did not get what we paid for and in fact one night did not even get to stay in the hotel we booked for. The whole experience ruined our weekend as we felt uncomfortable walking and washing in dirty rooms, stepping over our cases because we could not hang anything. We tried to speak to a manager and was refused 3-times.I Meant to write this a lot earlier to warn people about this hotel, but have had to deal with damage from Hurricanes Ramada Inn Eastside- New York, New York 161 Lexington Avenue New York City, NY 10016 We have traveled extensively all over the world for over 30 years and stayed in a range of lodging ranging from super luxurious six stars to rooms with dirt floors that you had to lock the doors to keep the goats out. When you go to Manhattan and pay those prices you expect a certain level of accommodation. Not a hotel better suited for some third world country. My apology for any third world county who has such a hotel. Ramada Inn - New York, New York is dirty, small and had an odor problem. As soon as you entered the hotel you are hit by wall of smell somewhere between musty and old gym locker. Our family stayed in this hotel for six days. We would have moved out within 30 minutes if could have found another room. For some reason most of surrounding hotels were booked. The lobby was small and dirty with furnishing showing their age. There were two small elevators so we had to split into two groups. My daughter got stuck between floors for almost an hour. This elevator continued to do this the entire time we were there so we avoid it. The other elevator was soooo slow. It was much faster to walk. Not sure they ever fixed it. Even now there may be some poor guest trapped. The hallway to our room had musty smell of mold. Although we had requested a non-smoking room our room had the odor of stale cigarettes and half cleaned ashtrays littered the room. I won’t tell you how the bathroom smelled. The seat to the toilet was broken and if you did not sit just right you would slide right off the toilet onto the floor. Despite numerous requests over six days nothing was done. Bath tub was filthy (could tell by the pubic hair the previous occupant was a red head) and the drain control had a jagged piece of metal sticking out is side. The grout between the tiles had a nice coating of slimy blackish mildew. This is the only time I can remember on vacation going out to corner market and buying a bottle of bleach and scrubbing pad to clean the bathroom so we could use it. Very low water pressure and at best it was luke-warm. Tried to adjust the temperature and the faucet knob literally came off in my hand. Found major dust bunnies and debris of previous occupants in the space between the bed and the wall. There was no tv remote in the room. Called the front desk and got nothing but promises. Had to wait until the occupants of a nearby room checked out and why the made cleaned that room got their TV remote. When we checked into the room the lightbulb to the reading lamp was burned out, called down to request it be replace. Said it would be. After several days and several requests and no action we went out and bought our own lightbulb. The bedspreads on the beds were in terrible condition with a number of holes you could one or more fingers through. Then we get to the really fun part- meeting the room’s wildlife. On our first night after checking in going out to dinner and getting ready for bed, we pull back the bedspread and blanket and watch a number of black dots scurry across the sheets- LARGE fat bedbugs. I even managed to capture one in an empty pill bottle. Took a picture of it for proof and I will post in the picture. I immediately called the front desk and they said they would take care of it. How they took care of it was to ignore the problem and continue to use the same sheets. The reason I know this is there was a stain on one of the sheets and it was the same sheet night after night. It not a very pleasant thing to have to strip off the sheets from your bed, take them out into the hallway and shake them vigorously to get rid of any wildlife. Were talking doing this for five nights in a row. Despite this the sheets felt itchy. Then we had the world famous game called “Chase the cockroaches up the walls as you take a shower” Don’t get too close or they might jump on you. New York Roaches are well known for being aggressive and nasty. See a race in progress in my pictures I have posted about this hotel Meeting the hotel’s wildlife continued at it Complimentary Continental Breakfast. Bagels were stale, juice had an off taste, fresh fruit had some pieces beginning to rot, flies and nats buzzing around food. Got a great picture of one when he landed on our table. I think he is smiling. What do you think? See picture I have posted. The bananas were in such bad condition they should have been buried rather then served to human beings. All it took was one exposure and a resulting queasy stomach and during the rest of our stay we ate breakfast elsewhere. Among the Amenities offered were Computers with Internet access. Which was very true if you can find one that works or you can try and use a keyboard with most of the letters and number worn off. What the hotel does not tell you is that they do not provide printers. I found this out when I was in the process of trying to check in for my flight and wanted to print my boarding pass. I was informed at the front desk I would have to use the next door cybercafe. This meant you would have to pay by the minute to use the internet. I found out later from front desk that this was owned by the hotel. Nice way to earn a few extra buck from something that was suppose to be a free Amenities. Then we come to the management and staff of the hotel. By their actions and response to questions asked and various requests by guests, they seemed to look at us guests as some sort of ill smelling bottom feeding scum sucking creatures and they were deities who like Job in the bible was cursed with the affliction of having to put up with them. Not only were they not responsive or helpful, they were ant-responsive and anti-helpful going out of their way to make the guest feel small when they dared disturbed important activities of reading a newspaper, talking to their girlfriends on the phone or just staring out the window. While the price may seem right, the experience is not worth it. There are a lot better hotels than this in the area for about the same money. NYC is a fantastic place. Why ruin your visit by staying here. Good Luck, See The World and Stay SafeAverage cake thats been courted by a LOT of hype.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.In mi burrito, here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste.What were the architects thinking when they desiged the intricately long walks to connect from some of the bldgs to the main lobby/pool?! The hotel is laid out in a choppy manner. The pool and the beach are nice. Surprisingly, the Pina Colada was undrinkable at the poolside! What is this reputation of the origin of the Pinia Colada here and the fact that you will be served from a prepared mix? Many complain. Delicious at the Pina Colada Club, in the lobby area of the property. $8 and $9 cost. ASK FOR IT TO BE MADE W/COCO LOPEZ AND FRESH or they will serve you the prepared mix that sits in a machine, like a frozen frape. Buffet bkfst is a disappointent. The buffet is lacking anything special or tasty. Eveyday is the same. Only omlettes are made in front of you as you stand and wait to order. The french toast and pancakes sit in a pan under heat lamps. Dry and tasteless. The waiter service is nill. Ask for coffee or tea and wait until after the meal. You'll get it then. I sent back two stained cups and one very chipped one. My tea came long after I finished eating. We forfeited the free bkfst and ate in Old San Juan bakery with the locals. Greasy fried stuff, not like our foods here. The recommended restaurants on this site are the same recommended by the concierge. Not one restaurant was satisfactory to everyone in our party. Only the black bean soup and rice and beans were tasty. All main dishes are in the mid 20 price range. Desserts $7 or $8. After your third night of rice and beans and flan, you can leave now! We were convinced that there really is no good retaurant worth the cost of the meal. Now for the reason for the title of this review. Ashford Ave, Condado, in San Juan is a suffering from the evidence of a very depressed economy with stores closed and graffiti on some of the bldgs. The hotels are worn and the streets in disrepair. I felt like I was in a country deep in poverty. There is no pleaseure in walking upon broken streets in humidity, looking at abandoned bldgs and some undergoing a facelift of construction. As for Old San Juan, the cobblestone narrow and hilly roads are quaint and remid me of what you see in Europe. Most of the stores are rip off jewelry stores, so many trinket sovuneer shops, and some restuarants. We ate in many that were recommended here. The Parrot Club served two under cooked salmons that tasted like the most oily fishy taste I have experiencd. $9 for the small tossed green salad and add'l $7 for the unedible fish we both sent back. The spoon had a dried piece of food on it. Server was nice. We do not recommend. The menu was lacking anything imaginitive. Cafe Puerto Rico was liked by my husband and O.K. with three others. Small and stuffy, only a few tables on each level. The cabbie told us it was his favorite place. Ropa Villa in Condado (Ashford Ave) had a live, too loud entertainer, hard to make conversation in this small restaurant with a man playing an instrument and singing. If sang more quietly, to create a sense of ombience, it would have been a nice idea. I had a fish that had a cilantro sauce that was very tasty. Food was served warm, not hot and fish was spongy and hard in the middle. Waitress was lovely and bread was good. Ceasar salad was a nice size and had the shavings, but the dressing was much too thick and made it difficult to enjoy. One dinner sent back because it was not warm enough to eat. Not worth the $$$$. Our first night we ate at Raices. Cold hard to chew steak sent back by two people. I only ate an appetizer of cod fritters. They were brought before all the other appetizers and placed in the center of the table, so we all ate it, thinking it was complimentry, like bread. Weird. So I had to order another one just for me to eat. When we asked why it was served right after the drinks were served and not with the other appetizers, the english speaking waitress could only laugh. She suddenly did not understand. That was our first awareness that many here pretend to understand and really do not and some choose not to when it meets their needs. There is really no attraction to come here. IF you plan to, then stay at a resort that offers it all. The staff here are friendly for the most part. Housekeeping is a mess. All calls take an hour to respond to and you will get less than what you ask for, the wrong request, etc. The operator is a total idiot who connects you to the wrong extensions. It takes forever for her and the housekeeping dep't to answer. We had water leak issues with our rooms and were moved twice. Construction begins at 6m and then so does your day! Low flying plans begin at 6:30am and are right next to the hotel. The pkg garage is heard from the room as well. If you plan to stay here and get rest, ...no, you will have little sleep. I did not see any kyacking, tennis or snorkeling that is advertised on their site. I did see a few men in shallow water wearing snorkel gear. We were told there is no snorkeling. 17 miles of beach? No way. A small, but nice area adjacent to a small public beach. From the pool area, you verlook jutting rocks and the ocean. There is no 17 miles of walking or usable beach here. That is an outrageous misrepresentation that may mislead you to thinnking it's a sizable place beach. No beach service. At the pool, I never saw a waitress in the week we were there. This site is has false and misleading attraction info that are just not true. P.R. is in a slump and that's reality. The food is over priced crap, and the cabbies try to charge more than the rate. Find another vacation destination that a friend has been to and recommends. I read these reviews and was astounded how no one spoke of the above comments!!!! It could have saved us from our miserable vacation.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

It's garbage.I did not do my research on this place before booking as it was a last-minute trip & that mistake just about ruined our entire vacation. I booked a 2 bedroom cabin at Trails End, which was supposed to sleep up to 10 people & boasted a view of the lake & a wonderfully serene setting in the woods. "Enjoy your morning coffee on your private balcony as you watch wildlife..." whatever. First of all, our cabin was right in front of the 2 dumpsters that I guess were used by everyone staying in the cabins. Those dumpsters smelled like dead animals & we literally had to hold our breath to get to the cabin from the car & vice versa. There was NO way that we were going to enjoy anything on our "private balcony", which actually was a dirty wood porch with an old picnic table that had a hundred names carved into it, including Lick. Even if it didn't smell of death, the noise from the window air conditioner would have prevented any enjoyment from hanging out on the porch. And I really wouldn't have gone out there to enjoy the scenery anyway because our view consisted of the 2 cabins in front of ours & the 4 cars that they had parked there. The lake was not visible from our cabin & when we walked down there we saw that we weren't even on the lake - the little bit of water where we were was like the edge of a farm pond. The whole air conditioning situation was absurd. The cabin is advertised as being air conditioned, but all we had was the loud little window unit in the living room. The a/c to the bedrooms consisted of fans that they had stuck in the walls to spread the window a/c air back there. Didn't work! It was miserable sleeping at night it was so hot in those rooms. We had the air on as high as it would go, which meant when my kids wanted to watch tv when we got home at night (since we couldn't go outside) they had to crank it to a volume that we had to yell at each other if we wanted to talk. The cabin had bugs, which shouldn't be a big deal since it is a cabin & all. And I would have been OK if it had been spiders or beetles or centipedes, even a scorpion, but this place had roaches & I draw the line at roaches. I had thought that we would eat breakfast in the cabin before we left for each days' activities & had bought everything for that, but after we saw roaches there was no way that I was going to let us use their dishes. The cabin didn't have a dishwasher & by that time I felt so dirty that I was not going to be satisfied just washing the dishes by hand before we used them. As mentioned in another review, there was no access to internet. That happened to be important for us because my college-aged daughter is taking an on-line class this summer & has to use the internet several times a week. I e-mail Indian Point & asked them about it & a Mary responded that they had a USB device that we could check out & that it was $5 per night. I was satisfied with this but when we checked in & I asked about it I was told that all of the devices had already been checked out & that there was a lengthy waiting list. Well, it would have been nice if Mary had mentioned that in the first place & I could have tried to get on said list. They sent us on a wild goose chase all over the place looking for a wifi signal & I guess they got tired of us because when my daughter & I went in for the 3rd time the lady said we would just have to go the the McDonalds in West Branson. "Sit and have a sundae or something." I wanted to ask if she was buying but refrained. So we drove in to West Branson twice just so my daughter could keep up with her class. Our last night there we lost power to the cabin. Luckily, we had packed some flashlights & my husband was able to find the fuse box & flip the breakers. There were 4 of us in a cabin that can supposedly be occupied by as many as 10 people. If they didn't have enough power to support us, how in the world could 10 people stay there?! I was very upset by then & called the office. Of course, they were all gone for the night so I left a message that we were unhappy with the accommodations & the loss of power was just the icing on the cake & left my cell phone number for them. Nobody ever contacted me. We are not a wimpy family. We camp & hunt & fish & hike & we are not opposed to roughing it. That's not the problem here. The problem is that this place was advertised as kind of roughing it with all of the amenities, in a beautiful & relaxing setting. That was the vacation place I was looking for & that is why I booked it & I feel like I have been swindled. We paid almost $800 for our 3 night stay at this dump & all I can say is that I'm happy that we did have some other good times in Branson or this vacation would have been a total disaster.Stayed here Thanksgiving week 2008. I called to get general information on TI. Asked the reservations person if in room refrigerators were available. She said “yes for fifteen dollars”. I asked is that fifteen dollars per stay or per day? Because I am staying there for 9 nights. She replied yes fifteen dollars per stay. I made reservations in September and reserved the fridge. I arrive at the hotel and I am told by the person checking us in that it was fifteen dollars per day. I informed her that I was told by TI reservations it was fifteen dollars per stay. She shrugged her shoulders and said it was fifteen dollars per day. I informed her that with the information I was given I had provisions for a refrigerator, fifteen dollars a day was ridiculous. She did not bother to call a manager, just smiled and said again oh well it’s fifteen dollars a day. We were tired from traveling and did not feel like arguing and we bought a few things for mornings that had to be refrigerated. She would not be able to do anything about this. I didn’t bother to make an issue of this with a manager later, we just wanted to start vacation and have a good time. We bought a $2.00 styro cooler at Walmart that worked fine the rest of the trip. All we wanted was to keep a few things cold for morning snack and keep ice in the room. The refrigerator was wheeled into our room on a old, dirty, rickety, squeaky, plastic and metal cart. It was hideous. I have never seen hotel room refrigerator that looked so disgusting in my life. It looks like TI does this on purpose so the guests are compelled to not have it in the room spend money in their overpriced restaurants. We only used the refrigerator for one day and returned it. Did not eat at any of the TI restaurants because it didn’t look like the food or atmosphere was worth the money. We did try to eat and have drinks at the Social House about 3 times but never did because they were closed each time we tried. 3 nights in one week ? Even the Social casino lounge was closed at 10:00 pm. [-] . Finding a restaurant was a chore. The Coffee shop an overpriced diner, boring for dinner. $13 for a cheese omlette. PHO does not excite me. The Social house was never open. Isla, we had drinks at a few times but never ate here. Pizzeria Francesco not open during the day,, cmon man it’s pizza, open the doors. Canters Deli,…over priced lunchmeat does not excite me either. Steak house, was always empty. That’s a sign Kahunaville.. our waitress did not want to be there. A real [-]. We arrived at 9:30 pm, kitchen closes at 10 pm. This does not make sense. Every table was eating at 9:30, even the bar. This is all nighter Vegas right ? Food was ok, drinks not good. Don’t get fooled by the free margarita coupons. Has no alcohol in it and WAY too much sugar. I took one sip and left it there. The bartenders would crank the music up and dance on the bar when Mystere theater patrons were leaving the theater to get peoples attention. It is next door. We were going to eat and have drinks there after the show one night, but the music was soooooooo loud it hurt and you could not have a conversation, the waitress could not hear you. What good is that ? I didn’t know they only did t his for 10 min then stopped. It deterred us from going there that night. What a bunch of morons. Oh we earned a comp for the breakfast buffet. Small variety for a buffet to start and The food did not taste very good. They put the desserts way on the other side in a corner where you can’t see it. The omelets bar only had 1 person working it and there was a huge line and wait for omelets. There are better managed buffets out there One evening after a show we decided to sit and have drinks in the Breeze bar. DH ordered a round of drinks and paid for it with a one hundred dollar bill that he obtained FROM A TRASURE ISLAND ticket redemption kiosk in the casino. The bartender stated it was counterfeit. He called security and told us not to leave the area with an attitude as if we were criminals. Casino manager came to speak with us and said she was not familiar with this type situation she did not know what would happen next. She said for us to wait for Security to come and talk to us. We told her we obtained the bill FROM THE CASINO. DH cashed in his winnings receipt and the $100 bill came out of the TREASURE ISLAND cash machine that morning. Then instead of sitting in TI bar enjoying drinks, we were discussing for a half hour the one hundred dollar bill that was confiscated and how are we going to get it back and what are they going to do to us if it is counterfeit even if it was passed to us FROM THEIR OWN casino ? Finally security came to inform us that it was just an old bill that did not have markings the IDIOT BARTENDER was looking for, NOT COUNTERFEIT and gave it back. It was printed before 1986 and the bartender was confused. Then security left. No one came by to apologize or anything.. I should have gone to the manager on this, but again I did not want to waste vacation time complaining. We were going nonstop and didn’t have time. Dealers are RUDE at Treasure Island. DH was playing black jack and he did not respond exactly the way the dealer expected. Instead of the dealer giving a basic, diplomatic clarification, he condescendingly told him “I can read your mind, you have to….” We never played cards there after that and made it a point not to gamble there. I had the do not disturb sign on our door. The maid still decided to enter the room, did not bother to knock, a rude intrusion! No privacy here. After I informed her that morning that I did not need the room cleaned or did not need towels or any other supply. I had just changed my clothes and went to the bathroom. It would have been embarrassing if she came in about 3 seconds earlier. Then she had the nerve to say to me “oh you are quick, you are back early “. She had no business in the room, there was no emergency for her to enter the room. The location was ok, This is at the very end of the strip where the decent hotels start. To the left is FSM and right is the strip. I would have liked to be more in the middle. This place has very tacky, sleazy business practices to rape their customers of every dime they can. It is so transparent. They emailed me a questionnaire about the hotel and comments about 1 week later. I gave them this and never heard from anyone. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN !!!!!!!My company puts us here. I've been staying here over two years and every single time the heater in my room is broken and I have to call for an engineer. A man arrives every time with a ladder, opens the vent grate, does something in there, and, it used to eventually work after it blew lukewarm heat for about an hour; a hassle every time that took from an hour and a half up to three hours, which causes great difficulty if you have plans because the first two hours of your stay will be occupied trying to do all this.But, the last two months, the heat never works even after I go through all that hassle! I have to get a space heater every time. Tonight, the same thing happened, of course, but this time, it took two hours for the engineer to show up, he said he even remembered me from before having to fix my heater. He told me the same thing as he always does, that the heat is controlled by water in common pipes that run throughout the building and they may need to be turned up to a higher temperature and that he'll go look at it and try to find me a space heater. I then waited a half hour and my hunger was too great, I left to go buy some food-to-go at their deli downstairs and asked the front desk person to please ask the engineer to just put the heater in my room if I'm not back yet. So, I got back and no heater. Then I called the guest service line and a gal told me the engineer was still trying to find two space heaters, one for me and one for someone else. Five minutes later a man from the front desk calls and asks me what I wanted. I said, just a space heater, I'm still waiting. He said the engineer told him he fixed my heater and the heat in my room is perfectly fine (he said that in a harsh and accusatory manner). I said, no, the engineer told me he admitted he could not fix it and will try to turn up the heat in the pipes and try to find me a space heater.The man again said he was told my heat was fixed, in an even more harsh and rude voice. I repeated to the contrary again and he said he'd call me back. Finally, the engineer returns, says he turned up the heat in the water pipes and it should be better now. I asked him if he told the front desk guy my heat had been fixed and he said no, and I believe him, he's always a super nice man, always polite, his name is Jesus, and he says it will get better, he can feel the heat blowing, give it 20 more minutes. Oh yeah, last time I stayed here they put in a room above the ballroom on a saturday night with a wedding going on. At 1AM I finally called the front desk and asked when the music would stop because I've been trying to sleep for two hours and the loud music is thumping through my bed and walls, they said 3AM! Seriously? Why put someone in a room right above the ballroom knowing full well the music would go on until 3AM without telling them as a disclaimer in case they might actually prefer otherwise? SO, after I'm all unpacked, showered, in bed, and after I toss and turn for two hours trying to sleep, they tell me they have another room for me and send up a key to a room on the other side of the hotel, quieter. They say I don't have to move my stuff, I can have both rooms, the new one just to sleep in, so why not put me here in the first place? So, at 1:30AM, after getting out of bed, throwing my coat on, I take the elevator to a different floor and crawl in bed again, for four hours, because I have to get up to go to work at 6AM! Then, I get up at 6AM and take the elevator back to my original room, embarrassed as heck because the people in the elevator see me in my pajamas, messy hair, half asleep, looking exhausted and I wonder what they're thinking about me. Somewhat humiliating. Now, I'm tired, embarrassed, stressed out and have to fly in an airplane across the country, yes, I'm a flight attendant; and now I'm supposed to act all happy and nice to the few hundred passengers I'll fly with today for three legs and 10 hours, serve food and drinks with a smile, and protect them in case there's an emergency, and try to look as glamorous as I can, or at least try to hide the dark circles under my eyes, with 3 1/2 hours sleep and stressed out! Great, thanks Hilton hotel! This is the worst hotel we stay in, sure, it's pretty in the lobby, has some nice employees, good drinks and service in the bar, and is a good location to the airport, but none of that is worth anything if you can't do what most people usually come to a hotel for, to BE COMFORTABLE and SLEEP! Oh, one more thing, another time I stayed here I left my Iphone charger in the room, called a few hours later & they said they never found it. Hmmm, every fellow employee in my crew who's ever left something accidentally in their room in this hotel says they never got it back either. Meanwhile, all the other hotels we stay at have no problem finding our things and holding them for us until we return. Wonder why in this hotel, left behind things somehow seem to never be found? My advice, unless you like cold rooms, not getting lost items returned to you, dealing with rude front desk employees who take out their frustrations with their company's maintenence problems on you; until they fix their "issues" I'd advise you to stay somewhere else! And you can bet that if any passengers ask me for hotel recommendations, I will not suggest this hotel, that's for sure! Unfortunately, I have to stay here, no choice at this time, but you don't have to.Extremely disappointed I am writing to express my complete displeasure and dissatisfaction with my recent stay at theGran Bahia Principe Resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. My fianc茅, two dear friends and myself recently returned from Punta Cana. I have never submitted any type of complaint, nonetheless, the experience at your hotel was so disturbing that I felt compelled to write this review. Although the facilities were facially picturesque, the hotel offered very little in the way of hospitality to its guests. I have traveled to numerous places throughout the world and can authoritatively state that this was one of my worst experiences. Moreover, it was the first time I felt insecure within the walls of my hotel room. One of the most frustrating aspects was the inability of the majority of the staff to communicate in any language other than Spanish. The inability to effectively communicate hampered any attempts at problem resolution. A simple question to the housekeeping staff could not be answered. The hotel did not provide any meaningful information in the form of either posted bulletins or in-room information brochures. As a result, the numerous questions we had concerning the hotel or hotel services went unanswered since, as stated above, most of the staff spoke only Spanish. Unbelievably, even at the so-called 鈥渟pecialty鈥?restaurants, it was impossible to communicate when placing a food order. The communication problems, however, pales in comparison to the lack of security when inside my hotel room. The hotel staff was able to enter my room at will, even when the alleged deadbolt lock was securely in place. For example, one night some time after 11:00 p.m. I was already in bed with my fianc茅. There was a knock at the door and before my fianc茅 could leap out of bed to answer it, a housekeeper entered purportedly to give us replacement beach towels. This was quite unnerving since we subsequently found out that housekeeping services ends at 10:00 p.m. Even more suspect the following day, another member of housekeeping entered our room [again the dead bolt was in place] at approximately 3:30 p.m. to ostensibly retrieve a paper bag. Upon arrival, the hotel had placed a brown shopping bag in our room that contained complementary Bahia Principe T-shirts. Once again, the dead bolt was locked and housekeeping had previously 鈥渕ade up鈥?the room. However, at about 3:30 p.m., there was a 鈥渢ap鈥?at the door and before we could respond, a housekeeper entered. She mumbled a bit and then stammered that she needed to retrieve this bag. She grabbed the bag and left. Understandably, we did not believe this pretence and indeed confirmed with the assistant manager in guest services that the hotel did not want and had no need for this little brown paper bag. I can only speculate that this person entered our room for some other reason. Regardless, neither of these events should have occurred and left me with a very uneasy feeling.Although nothing of great value was taken from my room, some small items were missing. For example, I had left various fully wrapped snacks on the dresser. I had brought these from home. In this case, the decision was very insightful since the mini-bar contained nothing more than 4 bottles of soda and two cans of beers. Hardly what could be termed 鈥渨ell stocked.鈥?As I said, the cost is not the issue, rather, this type of behavior is extremely objectionable and clearly undermines any feeling of security.In addition, I found it rather odd that the Bahia charged for use of the in-room safe. In order to use the safe, it was necessary to go to the reception desk, make special arrangements and pay $32.00 to use the safe for our 7 day stay. This is not the sign of a world-class hotel. On previous trips I have taken, hotels typically encouraged the use of the in-room safe without any additional charge to insure the safety of their guests. I would expect any organization that was truly concerned with the welfare of its patrons would freely offer this simple amenity. An additional security concern involves the purported 鈥渓ocked baggage鈥?room. We had a late check-in since our flight did not land until the evening, nonetheless, the hotel had a noon check out time. The day before we were scheduled to depart we attempted to make arrangements with the manager for a late check-out since transportation to the airport was not set to arrive until 5:45 p.m. The manager was unwilling to give us any answer at this time stating he did not know if the rooms would be available. Candidly, I did not believe this excuse. I find it highly implausible that the hotel did not know if our rooms would be needed for other guests arriving the very next day. Even so, the next day we renewed the request which was simply denied by the manager. He appeared annoyed that we dared to 鈥渂other鈥?him a second time. Interestingly, other guests checked out late without seeking prior approval and were simply assessed a $10 per hour fee. Apparently, the rooms were available and our mistake was taking the time to properly make a request. Absurd!In connection with the denial of our request for a late check-out, we were assured by the manager that while we waited for transportation to the airport, our baggage would be stored in a 鈥渓ocked鈥?room. In this way, we could still make use of the hotel facilities including public showers until we were ready to depart. Unfortunately, the baggage room was not locked, secured or guarded in any manner. We, as well as numerous other guests, entered the baggage room at will, rifled through our luggage unhampered by security! It was quite evident that the Bahia had been seriously overbooked. Indeed, there were several offers by the hotel for free all day excursions if the guests would agree to move to different rooms every time they returned. In an effort to accommodate a large in-coming party, other guests were offered $200.00 in exchange for moving to the Riu Resort for a couple of days. Upon their return, these guests reported there was much better food and service at the Riu. I should mention, I have traveled to many all inclusive resorts and I am not very fussy, particularly about food. However, the food at the Bahia was clearly substandard. Finally, although in no way connected to the Bahia, upon arrival at the Punta Cana Airport arranging for departure, we were told one of our bags was 2 pounds over weight. This could have been remedied by rearranging some items between the bags. Nonetheless, the person at check-in said it would cost $5.00. She must have noticed we were paying in cash because the price jumped to $50.00. What made this so appalling is the amount we paid but the fact that this girl took the $50.00 bill, did not give us any type of receipt and proceeded to stuff the money under her computer key board. As stated at the beginning, I was very displeased and dissatisfied with my stay at the Bahia. In particular, the lack of security is unacceptable. I will not return.The web site fools you completely. I stayed at Hotel Pennsylvania from Wednesday, March 30, 2005 and checked out on Saturday, April 2, 2005. You may be wondering why did I stay so long if I considered it awful. Because I was with a group of 21 people from Michigan that prepaid for the trip. This hotel came "highly" recommended from the travel agency in Michigan which went through an agency in New York. Not only will I ever go through the travel agency again, but I will shout to the rooftops not to stay at this hotel. Yes, the location was a good one, but you could easily walk to different locations because the streets are not long at all, or you could quickly catch a subway, bus, or cab to where you want to go. As far as I'm concerned, Vornado Realty Trust (the hotel owner indicated on their website) and the managers have no integrity. I say this because it is no way that they would stay at a place with blood-like stains on the floor, sink, and shower curtain, mold in the shower, rust on the vents, stains on the lamp shade and telephone, carpet that causes you to never walk barefoot, stained walls, peeling wallpaper in the hallway, duct tape keeping the hallway carpet together (in plain site), and decrepit doors. Not only was the entire room decrepit, but the entire floor was decrepit. Mind you, I was with 21 other people. There were three of us in the room. If you risk going to the Hotel Pennsylvania, view the rooms or floors first. They actually have crappy floors, meaning that all the rooms are similar by the floor. I was on the 3rd floor. My last day, after hearing that one of the people in my group went and complained for the 2nd time and insisted that the manager walk up with her to view the room that they placed her in after her first complaint, she finally received a decent room after initially being placed in a room that looked as if yellow crime scene tape should be placed around it (that is how she described it), we decided to take a look at her final room. It was very small, but cute. She had a bathtub and shower with minimal mold (I feel all hotels should pull out tile in the bathroom if they are not going to take the time to clean it properly). She had a cherry oak headboard and small entertainment center that held her television. She also had a clock/radio and refrigerator. It took her to complain two times in order to get a decent room. This room was located on the 6th floor. We were on the 3rd floor and had none of these things. And don't think it got better the higher you went because the 18th floor seemed crappy too. We walked around on a few floors as housekeeping was cleaning the rooms. Now the person that gave this hotel a decent review because they've stayed in crappier hotels, I feel sorry for him/her. But I have traveled on business for years and this was supposed to be a leisure trip so I'm assuming my expectations are either much higher or his/her expectations are lower because of the experiences. And since I travel so much, I will make sure that my previous employer and current employer know to stay away from this hotel. Yes, they have nice rooms, but Vornado Realty Trust should not be trusted. After returning home, I noticed that their website does not describe the amenities in the Standard rooms. This seems to be the "type" of room that we had. On the site, the pillows on the bed are covering up the fact that you do not have a headboard and that the walls are stained. You also do not see the bathroom for these "standard" rooms. And the lighting is not an accurate account on the website compared to what was our reality. Stay away, stay away, stay away. And if you have invested in Vornado Realty Trust, you are investing with a company that has no integrity. On the home (main) page of their site, in the second paragraph, they state "Inside of New York's Hotel Pennsylvania, you'll find beautifully renovated rooms, with new furniture and carpeting, a work desk with reading lamp, large color televisions, AM/FM clock radios, telephones with voice mail, individual AC and climate control are only featured in select New York City hotels." We should have assumed "compared to what." Well, we found out it that it was compared to the crappy rooms that they have. Read between the lines. You will find these renovated rooms, but you may not get one. This is an integrity issue displayed on their website. On the Accommodations page, it states in the second paragraph "The comfort and security of our guests are always important to us." Maybe the security because they have a security guard by the elevators, but definitely not the comfort. We were guests and our comfort did not seem to be important because they would not have placed us in a room like that. Again, proving their lack of integrity. I was not comfortable enough to step in the shower barefoot, therefore I constantly called housekeeping to bring extra towels, lay them in the shower and on the bathroom floor in order to avoid contact with any surface. And if I did, I would rewash that spot that touched the surface. Does that seem comfortable? We were so uncomfortable that we avoided the room as much as possible. The only good thing I have to say about the staff is that the man that brought me extra towels each morning seemed nice and the lady in housekeeping that I called to request for the towels would say "right away mam." Also, the people at the information desk seemed nice and helpful. We would sit in the lobby if we knew we were not going right up to bed. And now that I think about it, maybe I can assume that most of the people that sat in the lobby had rooms on at least the 3rd and 18th floor (the crappy floors that we saw). We were not comfortable at all. This is still fresh in my mind and although my description may seem over-the-top, we were the ones that stayed there.Not terrible, but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002.Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for?We stayed at the Grand Coco Bay (GCB) from June 29 to July 6, 2008. It was not the place that I thought it would be. If I had been in Florida and had a rental car I would have cancelled my reservation and drove down the road and found a nicer place, and there are nicer places. If I had never been to the Caribbean before I would have probably enjoyed myself better. On the way from the airport we stopped at some really nice resorts in the middle of the jungle that were very impressive and got our expectations up and then after you drive through the depressed neighborhoods (hood) and saw the GCB it was a real disappointment. I will start out with the positives: 1. The price was cheaper than some of the other resorts (you get what you pay for). 2. The majority of the resort was clean, except for a few hallways were the maids had hid some trash. 3. The pool bar was nice, and the drinks were nor too bad. I stuck with cold fruity drinks because it was so hot. The lobby bar was the best. 4. The beach is close and the resort is small so you do not have to take a tram to get from one area to another. 5. The hotel is about a 30 minute walk to 5th avenue. Now the negatives: 1. I would not recommend this resort in the summer. The air conditioning (A/C) in the rooms was just above sweating temp. You can not adjust the room temperature, in fact I talked to a couple at the pool and they said that their A/C was set with a motion detector so at night when they were sleeping the A/C did not come on. They argued with the hotel staff and on the last night of their stay they were finally able to over-ride the controls. The lobby and the buffet area was not air conditioned either. They depended on the ocean breeze to cool the place. The majority of the windows in the buffet area did not open so you could not get the breeze even if it was there. I felt the whole time I was there the only place that I could cool off was the pool with a drink in my hand. You could tell that the hotel management was trying to save some money on A/C. 2. The beach had 100 plus lounge chares but only about 5 thatched umbrellas. If you wanted some shade to get out of the 100 degrees temp you were out of luck. If we got up early enough we could find some shade near the pool. 3. The boats moored outside the hotel were not that bad of an eye sore, it was the fumes from the diesel engines that was bad. As the other reviewers said, the GCB was the only hotel as far as you could see that had boats moored on the beach. The boats moored on the beach were not as bad as the locals on the jet skies that liked to play chicken with the people who were brave enough to swim or snorkel near the beach. The hotel advertised that non-motorized water sports were free to guests. The hotel does not tell you that you can only use them for 1 hour for free then it is a 30 dollar fee for snorkel equipment or anything else you barrow from them. It was a ripe-off. Also hold on to your beach towel because when you check out of the hotel you better have the towels with you or your towel card or they will charge you 20 dollars per towel when you check out. The local beach is right next to the hotel, and if you do not mind seeing a few nude little kids swimming or the occasional topples or bottomless sun bather (they were not local). 4. The entertainment at the hotel was lame. The tall guy with the ponytail was not too bad but the rest of the entertainment looked like they made it up as they went. The theater smelled very musty. The resort advertized that this was family entertainment but a few of the skits had a local entertainer who was naked on stage with a sombrero in from and a smaller hat on his rear, which he dropped at the end of the skit to moon the audience. They also had a skit which was suppose to be like the movie sister act, except they had the nuns smoking dope, drinking tequila and one nun was pregnant. I noticed several families leaving at that point. 5. The taxi drivers were an experience. Sometimes the resort had a bell-person at the taxi station that would tell the taxi driver what the fair was from the hotel to where ever you were going, but coming back to the hotel they wanted to charge you 200 to 500 percent more. 6. The food at the buffet was not very good. They basically had the same food every night but they mixed it around and added some rice or other stuff to meet their theme nightly experience. The breakfast was not too bad. We ate lunch at the grill and the stuff that was suppose to be a hamburger was, well I do not know what it was. The specialty restaurants were the best dinner selection, but you had to make reservation early in the morning. The coconut shrimp and the chocolate symphony were good. When you walked into the restaurant, you could see that only half of the restaurant was full. Also men had to wear long pants or they would not serve you. 7. There must be a shortage of wash cloths in Mexico. We tipped our maid in an attempt to get 3 wash cloths for the number of gust in our room and the only night we received some was on the last day. I guess the maid thought she would get a big tip. 8. There definitely is a language barrier at this hotel. I tried for 3 days to get a battery for my TV remote control and could not get one. I am not sure if the hotel staff did not understand any English or they used it as a excuse not to help you. We were sitting in the buffet and a couple sat down to have breakfast. The table that they tried to sit at had a broken leg and the salt shaker fell to the ground and broke, sending big pieces of jagged glass on the restaurant floor. For 30 minutes, I and other gust tried to get the restaurant staff to clean it up but no one would. We finally pushed the glass under the table. None of the restaurant stuff seemed to care that there were kids walking around in flip-flops who could have been cut. 9. The travel people at the resort kept changing the price of the tour packages. If you asked them about the previous cheaper quote, they suddenly lost their ability to speak English.I would like to say that I am telling this story in all truth – everything I shall write is something that actually happened, without exaggeration. I will try to explain everything with fact and without emotion, because my experience was so utterly horrifying and strange that it should not require emotional emphasis. I checked in to the Hotel Mascagni with my two friends E and K (both women my age). The man behind the front desk (Luciano – I will never forget his name – Luciano) checked us in – this included photocopying our passports - and we went to our room. My friend K immediately put her things (wallet, checkbook, passport) into the room safe because she had them on hand. My friend E and I took a moment to take off our shoes, etc. When we went to open the safe, however, it would not open, even with the code. We called down to the lobby for help, and Luciano said he would send “the boy” up (“the boy” was the bellhop Giuseppe) to fix it. No one came for some time, so we decided to hide our passports in a drawer under some papers because we hadn’t eaten all day and we were starving. We went out for a quick bite and walked around, returning two hours later. When we returned, Giuseppe followed us up and opened the safe. K’s items were still there. However, when we went to get the two other hidden passports out of the drawer to put in the safe, my friend E’s was missing. We searched the entire room before realizing that it was officially gone. Just hers, mind you – mine and K’s were still there. E called her parents, both seasoned attorneys, and they advised her to call the police and file a report. We went downstairs to talk to Luciano, telling him the passport was missing. “That is impossible! You have clearly just lost it. Look again.” (He sent Giuseppe up with us – he lifted up beds that we had already checked under, moved furniture we had already checked behind, and when we asked what to do next, he just shook his head and left the room.) We went back downstairs and asked Luciano to call the police. He tried repeatedly to deter us from this. He wasn’t the best English speaker, so E tried to get him on the phone with her father, who speaks Italian rather well. He refused. Finally, he called the police. NOTE: It is important at this point to note that while my friend E and I do not speak Italian incredibly well, we understand it well. So we understood everything he said while speaking in Italian on the phone. While on the phone with the police, he did not report the passport as stolen. Rather, he said that “three little girls” had “lost” one of their passports. I can understand not wanting a police report with your hotel on file, but he essentially called the police and told them to not come because we were being “silly.” He said, “She tried to put me on the phone with her father, how ridiculous is that? What would that do?” He repeatedly got the facts wrong, and although we corrected him many times, he didn’t seem to care about the actual details of the story. Here’s a gem from this phone conversation: “We are like a family here, we would never steal. I can understand if it was a ring, or a hundred bucks, but a passport? And just one passport?” (So, just to be clear, you would never steal unless it was money or jewelry. Classy.) He hung up and told us that a police officer couldn’t come “because no force had been used.” To this day, I am not aware if this is an actual thing in Rome. But I’m fairly certain that the fact that he had not actually reported the crime that had occurred is why they didn’t come. He then started talking to someone else on the phone, presumably the manager of the hotel. Still unaware that we understood everything he was saying, he said, in Italian, “I’ve got the little one and the fat one here.” Now, I am overweight. But he is apparently in the industry of hospitality, and even normal human beings know not to call people fat right in front of them. That was it for me – I immediately got onto the INCREDIBLY slow Internet and started finding a new hotel. He had burned this bridge. At this point, it didn’t matter if the passport did turn up; I wasn’t spending another second there. I called the company I had booked with, and immediately demanded a refund. They promptly called the hotel, and Luciano proceeded to tell them the story that we “little girls” had “lost” the passport, and we were just being silly. My friend asked for the copy of her passport he had taken, and when he handed it to her, he said condescendingly, “Here you go, try not to lose it!” We went upstairs and packed our bags. As we got in a cab to go to another hotel, we turned to Luciano. “By the way, you should know that we understand Italian. And I heard you call me fat.” I said this loudly enough so everyone in the hotel lobby could hear. Very movie-moment. He denied it. He vehemently denied it. But then, as we put our things in the taxi, he came outside again and said, “Well, anyway, you are the more bigger one!” and scampered back inside. Without my friend’s passport, we had to beg a hotel to accept the photocopy so she could stay with us. We ended up staying in an incredible hotel (the Hotel Splendide Royal), which cost more, but was worth it because they salvaged the rest of our stay in Rome. The passport never turned up, as far as we know. They took down our contact information, but never “got back to us.” They still got away with charging us one night’s stay because of the cancellation fee. It also took them days to contact the booking company back to authorize our refund (as, I suppose, a final “screw you”). I ended up spending a lot of money to try and fix this disaster. This was, without a doubt, the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in. Look, if you really want to stay here – like, if your life depends on it - go ahead. But with a thousand other hotels in Rome where a passport has never been taken, and a guest has never been verbally abused, why would you?The 2 good things I found at this hotel: 1) LOCATION - You can walk to Universal City Walk within a few minutes. 2) Palm Restaurant is pretty good. Now the bad things I found: Arrival/Check-in Upon my arrival, it was rainy and I saw a sign to self-park. I followed the sign and parked the car expecting that I would enter the lobby level or at least a level with elevators or a covered walkway to the lobby. To my surprise, there is no elevators and I had to drag my 2 pieces of luggage across the parking lot in the rain and up 3 levels of wet stairs. When I checked in, they gave me 2 keys and 1 of the keys didn't work and checked me in a double-queen room when I asked for a King bed room. I went back to the front desk and told them that I requested for a King bed and the lady at the counter told me that my request was noted but it would not be guaranteed that I would get a King bed. They didn't tell me that when I booked the room. Some hotels charge a higher rate for a King bed than a Queen or Double Queen. It was a good thing that I traveled by myself and it was not a big deal. When we travel as a family, my 2 young kids like to sleep in with us (which may or may not be the best idea) but that what they like to do especially on a trip. I would have been really upset if I were to travel with my family. I later found out from another supervisor that they only have 4 King bed rooms in the entire hotel (that what he told me when he came to my rooms to discuss some other issues which I will share shortly below). Cleanliness (or should I say "DIRTINESS?") / Services/Conveniences DIRTINESS: After checking in, the first thing I noticed was a small bathtub with a filthy shower-head (the chrome shower-head is now in black color). I lifted up the sheets and there were some small black particles and even hairs! INCONVENIENCE - POOR DESIGN FOR BASIC THINGS This was a business trip and I had my work cell, personal cell and a laptop. I tried to look for place to charge all of these and another surprise, there is no outlet/place to plug in any thing around the nightstand between the 2 queen beds. Even their own alarm clock and lamp are plugged into the wall outlets behind the headboards that are not accessible. There is one duplex outlet on one wall of one bed and there is none for the other bed. I had to unplug the lamp to plug in one of my cell phones and the laptop and had to plug in the other cellphone on another wall that is not reachable from the bed (which means that if I either get a call from my personal phone or a work phone early in the morning, I would have to get out of bed to get to the phone or if you travel as a family and have other gadgets that you need to charge, you have to unplug some items to get other items charged). I have stayed at other much cheaper hotels where the electrical outlets are either on the lamps themselves or at a very convenience location. THEY TOOK SOME OF MY ITEMS THAT I COLLECTED FROM MY ROOM After going back from a trade show and stood in some long lines to get some freebies for my kids, I took them back to the hotel and left on the table. The next day I came back, I noticed that some items were missing. I picked up the phone to call their 'Star Service' number and there was no dial tone on the wireless handset. I walked to the wired desk phone and some of the buttons were sticky and worn out. I reported that some of my stuffs have been taken from my room and I gave them the benefit of the doubts that they might have mistakenly removed them and didn't report to security when the supervisor offered for me to do so. The house keeping manager called and left me a message a few hours later. The next day one of the front line manager called back and tried to address the issue. After all the issues that I reported, the only thing she offered to me was to find some replacement for the missing items (that would not be the same as what I collected). At least any other hotel or any service oriented managers would at least offer some incentives (such as discounted rate, complementary meal or some thing to keep the customers happy without the customers asking for it). They have no idea how to provide customer service. BACK TO DIRTINESS: On Thursday night, I took a shower and was about to use one of their bathrobes for the first time during my stay, I took the bathrobe out of the closet and there are few piece of rices on the bathrobe!!!! That means that never wash the bathrobes and put in the closet for new guests. How disgusting is that? I started to wonder whether they wash the towers or not. It's probably not a good idea to use bathrobes at any hotel from now on. I was too tired to deal with it and called the front desk the next morning and spoke to another manager. I asked him to come to my room to show him the DIRTY bathrobes and the chrome shower-head that had turned into a black shower-head. He found them to be disgusting himself but didn't really offer much until I asked for some incentives or discount. He offered future discount if I would bring my family back there in the future! I was thinking to myself, 'are you kidding me, you think I am going to come back after this experience?' I pushed the issue and he finally discounted the last day. Overall Overpriced, DIRTY and poor service. This is my worse hotel experience and I will never stay there again. Expect to pay $15/day for self-parking and ~ $25/day for valet (that is without tips). You don't even get wireless or internet access for free for a really expensive price already. I have not written any review before but I found that I have to write this review to share with people who may consider staying there.Don't recommend this place to anyone from a developed country My wife and I stayed seven nights at this resort for our honeymoon. We were there from July 12 to July 19. We were told that we would get a non-smoking room on an second floor with an ocean view. When we arrived, we were told that none of the rooms were non-smoking and we were placed on the ground floor. The first evening we noticed that our sliding patio glass door did not lock, so I called guest services to complain and they said they would send someone immediately. We waited an hour and then I called back. They again said someone would be there immediately. We ended up falling asleep holding our passports and valuables. The next day we marched to the front desk and demanded another room. We got one then. This room was better, and the sliding door locked. We wanted to use the safe, but the bolts were out and we needed someone to reset the thing for us, so I called and it took two days to fix that problem. The food was alright, but nothing to brag about. For an all-inclusive resort, it sure was limited. The room service was included, but only had about five items on the menu. The best meal for dinner was a hot dog or hamburger. We were told we could snack all day long and have all the drinks we could drink. This was true, but all the drinks had to be consumed at the place you got them at, and the snacks were not what we call snacks. They were hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, hamburgers, fruit. I was expecting Duritos, candy bars...junk food snacks. All of the food, including the snack food, had to be eaten at the restaurant/bar where you got them at. Nothing could be brought back to the rooms. The grounds were beautiful, with flamingos and peacocks walking around. There were man-made ponds with tons of fish and turtles. That was the best thing about the place. The beach was nice, but not as beautiful as one would have been at Aruba or the Bahamas. The worst thing about this resort is the customer service. The place had tons of activities, with maps in the rooms showing where they were, but if you needed any clarification or wanted to know what the schedules were, they wouldn't tell you. They'd just say, there's a board way over there....just look for yourself. The staff never went out of their way to help at all. Very disappointing. For it being a 6-star resort, I thought the Days Inns here did better jobs. The weather was great, and only rained one time during the day. When the walkways get wet, look out. It's dangerously slippery. My wife stubbed her toe while coming down the stairs. It started bleeding, so we went to the front desk. When we asked for some first aid, we were told that there was none. They told us to walk over to the supermarket and buy our own supplies! Nice service. When I walked over to the supermarket, I learned that they didn't even carry Peroxide, rubbing alcohol, or bandaids. The next resort over had a pharmacy. I walked the 5-minutes over there and found out that they were closed. My wife was bleeding and this place had nothing to stop it, or prevent it from getting infected. Thank God she didn't seriously cut herself...she would have bled to death! The resort would send us free mini bottles of rum with a fruit plate almost every day because they messed up, but that didn't satisfy us. They even had the maids leave us tee-shirts with the resort logo on them. Yeah...like I'll be wearing those any time soon. They'll make good rags though. The resort offered free transportation between the three Iberostars that were next to each other there in Punta Cana. The first time we did it, the staff was very quick and we got immediate service. That was the first night though. The other six nights we found that if anyone was busy, you ended up waiting a half hour (10 minutes to them) for someone to take you anywhere. We ended up just walking to the places. The only problem with walking was that it was so humid there, that if you walked any long distance, your clothing stuck to you with sweat. I lost five pounds being there seven days from sweating so much. All of the building are open except your sleeping room. At night you would sit there eating dinner or waiting for a ride for a half hour and just start dripping with sweat. I constantly had to dab my forehead and face with a towel or napkin to soak up the sweat. My face broke out with acne because it was so oily all day long. Their restaurants were buffets, and if you wanted the nice places, you had to make reservations with the guest services. Then they would only allow you to make THREE for the seven nights you were there. Not very unlimited all-inclusive as we expected. You can't drink the tap water or you'll get sick. We used bottled water to brush our teeth. We took an excursion outside of the resort and realized that this country was pretty bad off. The people live in little sheds with tin roofs and the thing that got to us the most was the amount of trash that was everywhere. There are literally no trash cans in the whole country. As you drive along the roads, there is trash lining the sides. The yards of the homes had trash all over the whole yard. People just lived with it there. They have their own cattle which they butcher and serve hamburgers from. That may explain why I got diarrhea from eating a hamburger for lunch on our fifth day there. Their fancy steak house had like five steaks on their menu. No Filet Mignon or Prime Rib. Just chop steak, ribeye, and some other steak I had never heard of. There was also a chicken breast you could get. If you didn't know Spanish while there, beware... The locals didn't hardly know any English. People we spoke with who didn't know any Spanish really had a hard time. The waitstaff and store employees didn't know any English. My wife, thank God, knew Spanish. I felt as though she was my translater. I know a little Spanish and was speaking it mostly. There are mostly Germans, French, Italians, and Americans at the three Iberostar resorts there. It's a family resort with little kids running around, so if you want some place romantic, don't chose this place. In the Caribbean there are these tiny ants that are almost transparent. They are literally everywhere. In your sleeping rooms, restaurants, everywhere. We were eating at one of the fancy restaurants one night and got to the dessert. My wife noticed these ants crawling all over it. We both lost our appetites and left. Overall we were disappointed in the resort and will never return for any reason. And we plan on writing a letter of complaint to the corporate headquarters. :(I went with my husband to Sandos 6/17 thru 6/24. We went for our honeymoon, which was posted in the booking of the trip through Vacation Express. We were told the resort gave a free upgraded room, and a gift basket among other things because it was our honeymoon. So when we got to the resort after a long day of flying and a layover, we were excited to get to the room. The bell boy was very pleasant and he assured us on the way to the room that we loved it. The man who checked us in at the desk refused to give us an ocean view room, said we couold move to one the next day. Our room was instead in building 45, a 10 plus minute walk to the resturants and beach, etc. Well the room smelled horribly like mildew/mold. There were tons of bugs. The floor was filthy. We did have a jacuzzi on the patio, with a view of the jungle and a dirt road. The jacuzzi though was filled with dirt, leaves, and debris. The phone did work and we were able to reach the desk. They did send two people to clean, who were also very helpful. They did not once mop the floor. To clean the jacuzzi, they only wiped it out. No sanitizer while the water ran or anything. |I don't know who in their right minds would want to use a jacuzzi that had not been sanitized. Not to mention filled with brown water. After a short time in the room, the safe did not work, we had no honeymoon gifts, it was sweldering hot and we were dodging bugs. They told us they could not move us till the next day. What a pitiful start to our honeymoon! We missed the dinner, because of all of this. We also could not find nor get a return phone call from the tour company rep who was supposed to be at the hotel. The food service stops at 10 pm, so we had to eat at the snack bar, only hamburgers and hot dogs, and chips. That was it. Not to mention the snack bar was outside and bugs were all over the food, and it was sweldering hot there and in our room. After a long arrival day and a very uncomfortable night being in the jungle with no air conditioning, bugs, and stench in our room, we marched down to the desk to ask to move to our ocean view room the promised the day before. They wanted 100/night extra for it. Others we spoke to did not pay anything. No way we were going to pay that. So they moved us to building 33. A little closer to the main part of the resort. We had looked at 2 rooms, and picked the least smelly. In one room they showed us, the neighboring rooms guest were standing stark naked on the porch, in view of everyone at the pool. We opted not for that room! The room they ended up taking us to, our second room, had no functioning air, no working fridge, no tv, and dead bugs on the floor. Again, we had to go back and waste time fussing with the front desk. We also inquired about our honeymoon package and they assured us we would have it the following day, our 3rd day of our stay. They did move us yet again. The 3rd room, and 2 moves for the day. The air was cool, but the coldest it would get was about 78 degrees. Not pleasant if you were at the beach all day and out in the 100 degree temperatures. The whole time they told us the air was working. No hot water the entire time. The room im building 36 had no working phone until the last day. The maintenance man told us the building was thrown together. There was not even an outlet for the phone untill they day before we left. The mini fridge never got cold, but they told us it worked. The tv was so fuzzy you could not see it. The water was brown. There were bugs in the room, and again you could not use the jacuzzi. The furniture was falling apart. There were holes in the wall where pictures had been. The only positive thing I could say is that our maid did a great job with what he had to work with. He never once moped the floor in the room. I never saw anyone with a mop the whole time we were there. And we asked on the 4th day where our honeymoon gift was and they told us they had sent it 2 times. But the room numbers they sent it to were rooms we never stayed in. They told us it was our fault becuase we did not tel them the right room number. First, they never asked the room number, just our name. Second, shouldn't they know what rooms are assigned to which guests? They told us it cost them too much money and that they would not send us another basket and that we were out of luck. The whole time we kept trying to call the tour rep and left messages everywhere. No response. No help. So we decided to make the best of it. The common restrooms were hideous. They stunk so horrible you'd have a hard time not gagging. Half of the womens toilets did not have toilet seats. They were dirty. Sadly, there were better public restrooms in Playa del Carmen on FIfth Ave. Trash all over the property, coke cans, cups , etc. The resturants were not air conditioned. Two were supposed to be, but they were not working. Dishes and cups filthy. Drinking water smelt funny even though it was supposed to be purified, and coffee was disgusting with a salty taste, like it was made with unpurified water. After being sick almost the whole time there, we decided they could not have been taking the precautions to keep things sanitary. The food was okay, it you like things that you have no idea what they were. The steak resturant was the best, but again the meat was a bit tough. The best meal we ate there was at Xcaret. There were never enough employees in the resturant. Half the time at the bar you would wait 15-20 min to get a drink. And the drinks were so pitiful. You could drink all day and not get a buzz, even if you tipped well, which we did. The pools were nice. Especially the one in the back of the resort, by building 70. A lot of topless people however, but that was everywhere. So be aware if you are taking children. The beach was horribly rocky and not clean at all. There was so much debris in the ocean, I know there was a hurricane, but they have had almost a year to clean up. The sand was filthy, and never groomed, seaweed was never picked up and there was a lot. Also a lot of bug bites even with using OFF!, but saw some people who were covered with bug bites. Take bug spray and water shoes if you are going to be outside or in the water. Now that I am home I realize what a disaster the trip was. Don't waste your money, go somewhere else! The negative reviews are true. And don't use Vacation Express. They still have not responded to my phone calls!First of all, don't believe the management responses and lean towards the reviews of the people. The people are unbiased Customers whereas the management obviously has something to lose (your business for making an educated decision based on real information... which is why we all use Tripadvisor). I say this because I see many management responses below which are discounting or denying what people have said that we have also seen first-hand ourselves and know to be true. Please make sure you look at our photos and the photos of others as pictures say it all. However, also note that Alle Guglie has posted many photos themselves and they show the place as being new and shiny and clean. Definitely not the case as you will see from true guest photos. Many of these are easy to identify because they come from their website. We could write many things about the disaster of Hotel Alle Guglie, but unfortunately only have limited review space. Here goes. First, the breakfast is NOT an amazing breakfast by any standards. My wife and I are very experienced travellers with 50 years of combined travelling experience to all parts of the world including less developed countries. So we have a good grounding on the wide range of standards and temper our comments according to the location and we review relative to the price and relative competition. The breakfast is the worst we have ever had in any European country in any level of hotel. Very limited food and cheap. We didn't even bother on the third day. Second, the air conditioning is NOT adjustable from the room. We were dying of heat in our room and went to politely inquire with the "helpful" staff about how to use the air conditioning. We were told it can only be adjusted from the front desk. I'm a professional engineer and I looked at the air conditioner in detail myself, and it definitely had NO adjustments and was also to my surprise improperly installed. They cut a rough hole in the wall and then just pushed the AC unit up to the hole. No hose, no seal. So a good majority of the hot air just recirculates back into the room. As for clean and in good condition? Any claim of that is a joke (refer to photos of mould and dust and hair everywhere). The hotel is a run down dump in a major state of disrepair. The carpets are so filthy they are black... they need regular steam cleaning. The majority of the room furniture is worn and often cracked with doors on failed hinges, etc. (see photos!). The rooms are pathetically tiny... and yes we know this is Venice and yes we expected the rooms to be small. This is normal in any old European city such as Paris and London. But Guglie has divided up their hotel into prison cells (another Customer told us he calls the place a Gulag prison and referred to his room # as a cell #). We could not move. We had no place for our suitcases. We had no room to walk around the bed. The bathroom dimensions were no more than 4 feet by 7 feet (see photos!). The worst problem is the mold. We actually stayed in two different rooms... first a regular room which had terrible air conditioning, was tiny, was loud (right outside breakfast room, and had paper thin walls). We complained to the "friendly" hotel staff and asked to simply check out the next day since we were so appalled and unhappy (we have never asked to leave a hotel for quality reasons ever before out of the thousands we have stayed at in life). They refused us... a very bad Customer service attitude by any standards. Instead, they insisted on moving us (remember the prison analogy?) to a "better" room. Yes this room was bigger, but it was also very run down. This was their "superior" room... superior with dirt and mold. The mold was so bad that the stench of it was overwhelming and we had to leave the door to the hallway open whenever we came back. I made the mistake of putting some of my clothes from my suitcase inside the dresser (with the cracked doors) and to my horror all my clothes picked up the mold stench and had to be cleaned at our next hotel. We sprayed the room with deodorant and tried everything. We would have loved to leave but were trapped in a bad experience. The source of the mold? We can only guess it was in the walls and the ceiling, but it came from the bathroom. And yes the hotel definitely knew about it (wait for the management response denying it however) because the maid also sprayed a deodorant in the room every day to try to cover it up without success. As for misrepresented, well we can debate this one with hotel management but you decide. Go to their website and look at the photos showing the hotel on the water. Look at their photos showing clean and new rooms. Then look at the real photos here. This is what any good Tripadvisor user does. This is what helps us all make good decisions and avoid scams so that we can enjoy our vacation and not throw away our hard-earned money. You will see in our photos the filth, the state of disrepair throughout the hotel, and the pictures of the place as it really is in June, 2011. The upstairs hallway looks nothing like their photos. Their is an old, broken CD player that hasn't worked for years. The chairs are sticky and dirty (steam clean if you really care management!), the floor boards are cracked and lifting. The list goes on and on... The free wifi is useless. Terrible coverage and you have to go searching for a spot somewhere in a hallway that actually has sufficient signal strength. You could turn this into a game for some entertainment to avoid staying in your room. Good things? The location is excellent, but then again if you take the time to research you will find many other hotels in the same location or close by and they are at similar price points or slightly more expensive. Many are truly on the water as well. Remember that Venice is actually fairly small and well connected by a good water transit system, so many locations are great. Any other good things to say? No. We have never been so determined to write a review ever before and we wrote this because we feel we were really misled and we were very upset. We really don't want other people to unnecessarily go through the same thing. To date, Tripadvisor has always served us well on hundreds of purchases and every other hotel we stayed at in Italy was what it claimed. We look for things like the ratings and the management responses because those typically mean that the hotel cares and is actively doing something. But I guess we learned from this experience that this isn't always the case and that it can simply be that the management has figured this out to their advantage. Something to be aware of next time.after reading all the great reviews, i was so excited to stay here, and then absolutely shocked by what happened to me at this hotel -- the condition of the room and how the management treated me. this is an AWFUL AWFUL HOTEL RUN BY AN AWFUL AWFUL PERSON. i booked 4 nights here, and the staff was overly kind upon my arrival. unfortunately i was placed in the top floor room which has an intense amount of water damage to the ceiling and walls, from rainwater leaking through the roof apparently. water was streaming from the light fixture as well as cracks in the bathroom ceiling. and the room is clearly regularly maintained this way (there are cracks and stains all over the ceiling, dried water rings inside the glass light fixture, and the bottom of it was completely melted/exploded out -- NOT SAFE). Â water drips on you from the ceiling while showering as well as standing to use the toilet. the room was consumed by an OVERPOWERING presence of mold and mildew -- both in visible patches (see photos) as well as spores in the air to the point that sleeping in the room will make you ill -- i spent one night coughing and woke up exhausted with headaches and a sore throat. Â i have an allergy to mold/mildew (who doesn't?) and this was not just a smell -- it was an overpowering presence in the room. as a side note, but all very secondary to what follows in this review, there is lots of noise from the street and the rest of the hotel, the curtains are see through and dont block light, the hotel wifi doesnt work & they told me just to pirate someone else's network from nearby, and the phone was sitting on top of a cabinet in the high corner of a room on a surface that had never been dusted. Â also, there are no "do not disturb" signs to use, so plan on being disturbed. HORRIFYING PART OF THE STORY: Â the next morning i went to explain to the staff that i had to leave because the mold & mildew was making me sick, and i didnt feel comfortable showering under water streaming from a light fixture. Â (the other light fixture in the bathroom looked homemade with exposed wires & sitting on top of a hole cut out in the cabinet -- but this one wouldnt even turn on). i explained that i was happy to pay for the night i had already stayed, but that i had to move to a different hotel. Â the first person i spoke with was quite shy and kind, but clearly not top level management. once the person who appeared to be the "boss" arrived -- he admitted that the room has water damage and mold because its on the top floor -- but proceeded to tell me that they "sell this room all the time and no one ever complains". Â which a.) flat out can't be true due to the room's condition, and b.) is irrelevant. Â he continued to say how my complaint was untrue, that it was not making me sick, that i was lying and if i didnt like the room, i should just say so... when i tried to explain my discomfort and the condition of the room (VERY CALMLY and POLITELY like a professional and sane human being), the man behind the counter started saying "shut up shut up shut up" the whole time i was talking, not listening to a word. Â i honestly thought i misunderstood, so i asked him if that's really what he was saying. Â he started cursing at me telling me to "take your [expletive] bags and get the [expletive] out of my hotel!", etc. i was so shocked and stunned that i got upset and started trying to defend myself (while he continued to be so verbally violent, aggressive, and mean), and the man STOOD UP, LEANED OVER THE COUNTER, RAISED HIS HAND LIKE HE WAS ABOUT TO SLAP ME IN THE FACE, AND CONTINUED CURSING AT ME AND THREATENING TO HIT ME IF I DIDNT STOP TALKING. the other staff member there was trying to stop him, saying "no no" but clearly he was afraid of this man, and was afraid to even say anything or do anything substantial. having just arrived in a very foreign country, i was extremely shaken by this and told the man i would be calling the police and also reporting this incident on all the online review sites. Â he was so smug the entire time saying "call the police, do it, i dont care" and cursing -- knowing that a tourist has no recourse or protection really -- what can you do? Â i live in NYC and the NYPD would certainly laugh at a call like this, they have things like murders and car accidents to deal with. so i took my things and left immediately, and went to the hotel next door to see if they could offer a suggestion of a place i could complain. Â they suggested the tourist police, but i decided it was best just to get out of the situation and not make things worse by further antagonizing the crazy man from Ocean's 7, or involving police in an unfamiliar country. this review is in no way exaggerated. unfortunately this shocking experience is 100% accurate. on my way out of my room i did see other rooms with their doors open on different floors, and they appeared not to have the same problems my room had. Â so maybe you will be lucky. Â  just know that if you are unlucky, that you may be physically in danger if you complain (no matter how polite or professional you try to be). most of the staff was overly overly friendly, but i know now they are only like that when it makes them extra money. Â if you happen to need REAL customer service (like when something goes wrong, or if it involves the hotel losing money, rather than making extra) -- you might get slapped. Â literally. AND after all this... he charged my credit card. please don't patronize an establishment that operates in this way.I initially booked a room at this hotel because I thought its location would be ideal since it is in close proximity to the Paddington tube station, and in fact that turned out to be the only positive outcome from my stay there. The hotel appears lovely from outside and the lobby is quite nice, too, but on the first night there I was waiting to check in and I received an omen that I was about to experience an awful stay. A couple there was complaining about how they had requested coffee 48 hours ago and they had called several times to remind the concierge but no one did anything about it. It was obvious that they were upset and the concierge really did nothing to help them out, it seemed he couldn't care less. He wouldn't answer them when they asked for the manager's name, nor would he give them a contact number. The couple was enraged and they left fuming. I thought at first that maybe it was just them but then that same night I discovered that we didn't have a blowdryer so I went to the front desk to request one and the concierge there said there wasn't one available because all the rooms were booked at the moment and he would need to wait until someone had left the next morning so that I could have one then. I found that hard to believe but went along with it. So I called the next morning around 6:30 and asked for the blowdryer. I was told then that they would deliver one to my room in 15 minutes. Half an hour passed by and there was still no sign of the blowdryer so I called again and this time another person answered and he told me that it's "in the drawer"...I asked which drawer, and he continued to be vague so I just hung up. It turns out that it was in the dresser drawer right beneath the TV (which by the way didn't even work properly) but I couldn't understand why I wasn't told that the other night when I initially asked for it. Anyway, we had this other problem with the staff there. Besides the fact that most of them 1) were rude and disrespectful and 2) were totally incompetent, it seems that they actually went out of their way to make our stay difficult. We needed a room for one extra night since we were spending part of our vacation in Paris and we were told that we wouldn't have a problem getting a room. The next day, however, when we tried to book something, this other receptionist, a short Indian woman whose name I couldn't catch, told us that we were mistaken, there was nothing available for the night we requested. Obviously we were furious because not only were we given the wrong information the previous night but she did absolutely NOTHING to help us, and her sour expression showed no sign of empathy at all for our situation. We decided to speak to someone else the next day and the assistant manager, Roy, handled the matter but he did put on a very arrogant and snooty attitude. He didn't give us any confirmation of a room but merely signed a letter saying that something was available and that was all. So we came back from Paris and apparently there was a mix-up because they couldn't find anything booked under the cardholder's name (my friend's, who was staying with me) and they told us that they were fully booked for that night so we couldn't stay there. Fortunately, we were able to get assistance from the manager there who was really a blessing. If it weren't for him we would have been left with no place to stay our last night in London. Not only was he corteous and kind but he also went out of his way to do what he could for us. It turned out that the room was booked under my name although it would have saved us a lot of time and trouble if Roy had told us that to begin with, but anyway, we got to stay at this 4 star hotel instead of at Paddington for the same rate that was promised to us, so in that sense we lucked out. Even our transportation to the other hotel was provided for us thanks to the manager (I can't remember his name because I lost the business card but I think it was something like Peader; he had a slim build, average height, and red hair). Really, I can't fully express just how terrible the service was at this hotel and the manager was the only person who stood out as someone who cared about the customers. If you can settle with bad service then stay there because it is in a good location but I would rather stay somewhere else that has a nice and friendly staff. I'll admit that the rooms were decent but still small, and the TV gave us problems (it wouldn't turn on at times). Overall, I would have to say that it's really not worth it to stay at this hotel because it will ruin your trip by making you disgruntled twoards Londoners thanks to the poor service and attitude at the BWPCH.Traveler's Beware!!!! My friend and I visited the Grand Paradise Bavaro from April 24th-April 28th and I will start by saying it was the worst vacation we have ever took. Let's start with the airport.. hmm where should we start.. you get off the plane and are directed to your terminal (which by the way is a thatched roof building), you are then told you need to purchase a tourist card for $10.00 U.S., after the purchasing of the card you must wait on another line to go through immigration (word to the wise, if you are traveling with more than one person have one person purchase the card and the others stand on the immigration line which can take very long). After passing through immigration you are then told to give back your tourist card (it's another money making scheme and it should just be added onto your package to make the hassle easier). Coming back home is worse because you will stand on line for a long time just to get your tickets, then stand on another one to go through immigration and then another one for security. We arrived at the airport at 12:40 p.m. and did not get to our gate until 2:15 p.m. and our flight was scheduled to leave at 2:20 p.m. Thank goodness it was delayed. Now I know the airport has no bearance on the hotel which I am now going to cover with you. We arrived to the Grand Paradise Bavaro, waited on line for check in for about 20 minutes, to only be told that we were booked on the Club side of the resort. Buyers beware, if your travel documents say Saver then you are on the Club side of the resort. We were then taken in a golf cart or what appeared to be a golf cart to the other side of the resort. Upon check in we were told our room was not ready, however we could have lunch and walk around and the room should be ready by the time we came back. Fine with us, we did just that and came back and room was not ready for another hour. After the room key was given to us, I asked for another one for my friend and they told me to come back. I asked for a safe key twice and was told to come back. I was not happy with that at all because I was traveling with several pieces of expensive electronics and cash and a little jewelry and I did not want to leave it out. The bell man came and escorted us to our room and boy was I surprised when I opened up the door. The room literally was no bigger than a closet, had two adjoining doors on each side of the room and one double bed and one sofa bed. This was not the room I requested. I asked for a room with two double beds. Who wants to travel all that way to sleep on a sofa. I could do that home. My friend and I immediately went downstairs and spoke to a young woman and told her the dilemna, Ezekial who checked us in overheard us on his way out, had the nerve to have an attitude and tell us that it was one of the better rooms on the resort. Our response to him, then show us your worst. Ernesto Infante (and the only reason I use both his names, is because I will be writing a letter to the corporate office about him) then told Ezekial to leave and he would handle it. I did not like his attitude immediately, so I asked to speak to a manager. Marlen Mena (she will be receiving a complimentary letter) came out and asked us the problem. I told her about the room and how it should have been disclosed to us at check-in that the room had a sofa bed and a double. She agreed and Ernesto stood next to her and said that we were told that... What??? My friend and I immediately jumped all over him (not literally) and told Marlen we were not and if we were complaining now about it wouldn't we have complained upon the initial check-in? Ernesto said we were liars and it was said. At that point my friend and I had it and voices started to get raised. I asked Ernesto for his name and he rudely told me he did not have to give me that. I said yes you do. Marlen agreed with me and tried to hush him througout this transaction but it did not work. Marlen then told us we would have to spend the night in this room but she would move us tomorrow. Nope not acceptable, move me to the other side of the resort then. Twenty minutes later with some strings pulled, we had finally been told we would be at the main resort. Marlen gave me her business card and Ernesto's name and apologized for the service we received. Now back to the other side of the resort, after check-in again (where I was given a safe key immediately) we were given a larger room with two double beds and view of the ocean and the pool. We tried to be positive, however our first night at the buffet was absolutely horrible. The food was horrible and so was the service. I understand that you are in a different country and the food would be different but some of it did not look like you could consume it. I stuck with rice and chicken the whole week because we could only get a reservation to one restaurant which was the Chinese. When you eat at the buffet the linen remains on the table that previous diners used. Stains and all which is a little gross, service there is horrible and it could take forever to get a drink. This went for all meals ate at the buffet. The bars are horrible!!! I am a drinker and only consumed three drinks the whole five days I was there. A pina colada tastes like a Long Island Iced Tea, LIIT tastes like a rum and coke and so on. All the drinks taste the same. One night we went to the piano bar and my friend asked for coconut rum with orange juice. He gave her a glass of O.J. She then told him she wanted it with coconut rum, he proceeded to pour her a class of rum with coconut juice. Once again she told him what she wanted and he walked away disgusted...The language barrier was horrible. I received sun poisoning while I was down here (no fault of the hotel, just my stupidity) and went to medical services. The nurse does not speak English and could only communicate to me in spanish (thank goodness for elementary spanish lessons), however it was very difficult to understand everything. Oh, before I forget we did see a roach crawling on the counter by the pool bar. Clean towels are given sparsely and wash cloths do not exist (pack your own). Also pack a light bulb that is 75-100 watts because you will not see anything. Bring plenty of singles, fives and ten dollar bills because it seemed impossible to break a twenty. Our last day there, my friend and I were doing a dance of happiness to return back to home. Now by no means do I write this review because I expect the world. I travel to a lot of all inclusives and this by far was the worst one I have been to. I don't expect five star elegance or filet mignon, however I expect courtesy, good service and decent food. Grand Paradise Bavaro had none of these qualities.. Traveler's beware, paradise will not be found here.several times and put up with the waiters' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.We stayed here for Memorial Day Weekend based on a successful Priceline bid of $109.00 per night to stay at a 4 Star Hotel in the Beverly Hills area. We stayed from Friday night through Monday. We asked for a room with two double beds as high as possible and we were placed in Room 1556 which featured a balcony looking west. The room was a fair size. Not large, but not cramped. The beds and linen were low quality and not nearly as nice as beds one would normally find at a true 4 Star property. The bathroom was older in look. The molding around some of the wall tiles was wearing away and the toiletries provided were of a low grade/quality. The shower head was also just a standard, lower grade and the bathroom itself was hardly 4 Star. The room had a medium sized patio with some garage sale looking cast off furniture. Our room was on the west side of the building and the view was nothing special - just a view of the mall and a not very interesting neighborhood of office complexes. The hotel is within a 5 minute drive to Beverly Hills and a 20 minute drive to the beach. The pool was out of order for half of our stay which was extremely unusual for a busy holiday weekend. However, because the hotel is nestled amongst high rises, the pool area never really got sunny. There is a health club attached to the hotel. However, the daily fee is $20 and is just one of the ways that this lackluster property seeks to nickel and dime its "guests". The hotel does not have coffee makers in the room because they want you to buy coffee from their Starbucks in the lobby. However, they do not open until 6 a.m. and for those of us adjusting from the Eastern Standard Time zone, it's annoying not being able to get coffee until it feels like it's 9 a.m. We did notice that there is ZERO checking of hallways for dirty dishes. We frequently saw discarded breakfast trays left for hours in the corridors. On the last night of our stay we tried to go to bed at 10 p.m. because we had a 7 a.m. flight to catch at LAX. However, after dark, the mall across the road apparently turns into the world's LOUDEST outdoor nightclub. The mall has several bars that BLARE music at levels reminsiscent of the music blared in military siege situations as a form of psychological warfare. (Think the siege of Manuel Noriega where the US military tried to drive him out of his complex by blaring music in an effort to drive him insane). When we laid down at 10 p.m., we could feel the bass beating in the room. Closing the patio door did nothing to decrease the pounding music. After an hour of hoping that the music would STOP at 11 p.m., I caleld down to the front desk to complain about the noise. I spoke with the on duty front desk manager, Clifford and advised we would like to move rooms to the other side of the building because the music from outside was so loud. He acted as if he had no idea about the music. He said he would send security to see if there was a problem. A half hour later, with no knock on the door from security and with the music from outside getting LOUDER, I called back down and asked to speak with the on duty manager. The operator gave me to Debra, the night manager. I advised Debra that we had called a half hour before to complain about the noise. She said that there was nothing she could do as her security guard had stood OUTSIDE our room door and heard no noise anywhere on the floor. I then went downstairs and confronted Debra. She initially tried to claim that there was no noise problem. I requested that she and her security guards come to the room to verify the noise problem. She initially said "That noise from the mall is a city problem and you need to call the police." So, in order to enjoy peace and quiet at their hotel, I would need to be the one who made a noise complaint through the Los Angeles police department - all while Debra STILL insisted that there was no noise problem. As we were waiting for security, she tried to make small talk about the weather. I told her I wasn't in the mood to be dismissed with idle chit chat and that I was stunned that a Hyatt property would treat their guests this way and that I would do all in my power to make corporate know about how poorly guests were treated at the Hyatt Century City. At that point Debra said they were a franchise property with no accountability to HYatt and that a complaint to Hyatt corporate wouldn't make a difference to her AT ALL. She didn't yet offer to move our room to the opposite side of the hotel. She did go up to the room with 2 security guards. One of the guards upon hearing the VERY audible music said "That's the way it is ALL NIGHT, EVERY NIGHT." So, I had an admission from a hotel employee that the music from the mall is ALWAYS like that at night. We hadn't noticed the nights before because we had gone to bed late and exhausted from sight seeing all day. It was now 1:00 a.m. and the hotel's own security guard admitted that the music was a very common problem. Finally, 2 hours after I had started complaining that we couldn't sleep because of the noise, Debra offered to move our room. We had to leave at 5:00 a.m., so by then there was utterly ZERO point in switching rooms in the middle of the night. We packed up and left at 2:00 a.m. So, if you would like to stay in a hotel that has music blaring across the street until the middle of the morning and if you'd like to stay at a hotel where 2 departments' managment tries to deny a major problem affecting "guest" satisfaction until a lower level employee conceded that the music is a constant problem - then the Hyatt Century City is for you. Oh yeah. Valet Parking is $35 a night and the valet is run be a separate company that is completely disorganized. It always took at last 20 minutes to "find" our car and we stood next to a couple who had been waiting for a half hour because the valet lost their keys. This hotel is a major embarrassment to the Hyatt Brand and we will NEVER stay in a Hyatt or use Pricleline again because of the lies, denials and utter lack of care for guest satisfaction shown by the property's managers Debra & Clifford. Horrible, horrible, horrible experience that ruined our intended long weekend "getaway". The getaway was when we left the awful, awful property that should have its Hyatt label taken from it.I would not recommend MEET at all, it is a rip off all the way from the time to step in!in conclusion, THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!Our waiter was horrible; so rude and disinterested.For our anniversary we booked a suite with fireplace for 250 a night. Upon arrival we were informed our room wasnâ€™t ready and if we can wait in the lobby. As I sat there waiting I saw housekeeping come and enter a room very close to the lobby. They spent most of their time in the door way of the room and after 5 minutes they informed the front desk they were done but they are waiting for pillows in French which I understand but do not speak. Therefore before they called my husbandâ€™s name to inform us the room was ready but my husband and I knew this semi cleaned room was ours before they called his named due to the fact we are not blind and understood their entire French conversation about the room not being ready on time. We entered and housekeeping told us she will be back with our pillows and finish making the bed, this took about 15 minutes for her to return! We had reservations at the Center Bell for 5:30 and we checked in after 3, so our plan was to take showers and start walking to the Center Bell and forget what just happened. Unfortunately the disappointment continued when I discovered the water pressure in the shower was a joke and the tub was clogged so I took a shower with water above my ankles. Trying to get the right temperature was a mission, either scorching or freezing while playing with the handle until it was a safe temperature. My husband unclogged the disgusting drain so we can at least have a normal shower when we return. We used the wash clothes and towels for drying and one for the floor since our shower curtain was cloth and allowed water to spill onto the marble floor, so we placed 1 of the 2 towels on the floor to avoid slipping. It was oddly colder than usual in Montreal during our visit so we turned up the heat with anticipation of arriving to a warm room upon return. The fireplace is solely for show and will warm you if you sit directly in front of it. The rugs need a shampoo and the walls need some spackle for all the cracks and fresh coat of paint or just wash the hand marks off the walls. DÃ©cor was beautiful but didnâ€™t distract me from the noise we heard from the lobby, front desk and the other visitors directly outside smoking under our window! This was a one night stay and I am glad because if we were planning a longer stay there would be no way I would stay here. When we arrived after our night out at 1am not one towel was replaced and the room was still cold. My husband discovered the next morning that the large windows do not fully close and that is why we were cold. The only heated area as I mentioned before was directly in front of the fireplace and the bathroom. I might have considered using the couch cushions and a blanket to sleep on the floor next to the fire place but as I said the rug was very noticeably worn out and filthy as was the couch. We woke up at 9am and got ready for breakfast in the dining area. I wish someone would have told us that cold frittata and slices of turkey is what to expect. There was not much left at 9:30am and no seats. I was greeted by staff who said Bon Jour and I replied Good Morning and without asking he explained we cannot return after we leave and get more food! When he saw the puzzled look on my face he explained that some guests try to eat the FREE breakfast from the time it is served until 11am and laughed while looking around at other guests expecting them to find this funny as well! I smiled and walked away confused wondering why he felt the need to say something like that to me? I feel it is insulting and unnecessary bit of information. For the price I paid for this room compared to the prices I read in these reviews I apparently paid too much and should have gotten my left over cold breakfast delivered to my room which technically was not far from the dining area and lobby so it wouldnâ€™t have been a long walk for the staff and the he can properly ensure I wasnâ€™t going to steal extra free food. After being embarrassed we found two seats and sat down attempting to enjoy what I could and within minutes the same person who told me no second helpings asked if he could take our plates and I felt rushed! Check out was at 12 and we left way earlier because I just didnâ€™t want to sit in a cold room with a TV that should have been a flat screen. The remote control buttons were either dirty or worn out due to how old the TV is. Pictures are deceiving on the website and the people who love this hotel that is wonderful and I guess that only means I need to lower my expectations. Where I come from paying 250 a night gets you a fantastic room in the tri-state area, one that my husband doesnâ€™t have to play plumber. It would have also been nice if the front desk told us just about everything is closed on Sunday. The only answers I got as far as activities outside the hotel are maybe this and maybe that, which isnâ€™t comforting when you are visiting for the first time. Since we walked in the door I had this sense of an atmosphere that was poorly managed and I felt not mentioning the horrors of my stay would save me the empty Iâ€™M SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT statement which wouldnâ€™t alter my experience! I was obviously right because according to other reviews not much gets done when you voice your concerns here. With that said, I do not plan on returning to this hotel or recommending it to anyone that likes to be treated like a human or luxury along with cleanliness.The place is nice. The rooms were definitely nice with nice linens and bedding, as well as furniture. The service was absolutely HORRIBLE and I can say that the niceness of the hotel could never make the LACK OF SERVICE better than it was, nor make me EVER EVER want to go back or even refer someone to go there. REASONS: 1.) Check in/Service - the ladies at the front desk ignored everyone, including me, my spouse and his best friend, a groom, who was having his wedding at this location. After 5 minutes of standing there, in front of them, while they failed to acknowledge our presence, they proceeded to check in my spouse and I. This part of the check-in seemed semi-decent; I've seen better. Then it was the groom's turn to check in. This turned into hell. Maria, the lady checking us in, ignored the groom for about 2 minutes while she was on the phone; she failed to acknowledge him properly. Then while she was checking on his room, she said that his future wife already checked into their "day of" room and honeymoon suite. She was confident about it, stating it was a fact. We called the bride to verify; she said she was in her parent's room and did not check in, so, obviously she did not check in. Once we informed her that the bride did not check into the rooms, Maria replied with "Oh... Yeah... well, no one has checked in yet." SERVICE FAIL #1 because she has no idea how to do her job. 2.) Service - I had some wedding guests in my room prior to the ceremony. There was a wardrobe malfunction and we needed some safety pins. Knowing this was supposed to be a 4 Star Hotel, I thought it would be an easy task for them to complete, especially because another4 Star Japanese hotel in San Diego was able to successfully complete this task in the past. I called down to the front desk and asked for 2 safety pins; they responded stating that they would call housekeeping to see if they could get some and then call me back. 5 minutes pass by, no response. I call back down and ask again. They said the same thing. 10 minutes pass by and nothing happens. I call down for a THIRD time. They responded angrily and said they would check and that they would place me on hold; they hung up. I waited for another 10 minutes for someone to come up to the room. They didn't. I walked downstairs to the front desk and asked how difficult it was to get 2 safety pins; one lady with curly hair responded angrily and said that she heard the lady who answered say what she said and that the phone disconnected and that me "waiting" for 30 minutes was not true. If the phone disconnected, and they know which room the telephone call is coming from, why didn't they call back? They obviously don't know how to do their job and especially don't know what "Customer Service" means. SERVICE FAIL #2. 3.) Service - After the wedding ceremony, we went down to the Azalia Restaurant. Nice venue and decent but not average service. Due to their inability to maintain the side entrance from the STREET, 2 wedding crashers walked in and grabbed drinks and appetizers. People from the wedding party had to kick them out. I don't know why the hotel didn't take the precaution of blocking off the STREET entrance when they knew a party was being held there and that anyone walking on the street had access to the entrance. SERVICE FAIL #3. 4.) Service - Breakfast in the Azalia on Sunday morning. Definitely not worth $17.95 per person. No one came by to serve water or greet us. I had to search for a spoon. We had to track people down to get the check. If someone was there to give us service, we wouldn't have to search for spoons or water (which I never got the entire time because by the time I was done with my breakfast I didn't need water anymore), which then would also allow for them to properly figure out how to break up the checks. SERVICE FAIL #4. 5.) Service - Parking. Parking was decent in itself. The worst part of it was when my spouse was getting the car, they made him pay cash only. He had to back up and park, then go find an ATM and get cash. It cost $25.00 to SELF park over night. That's ridiculous in itself. We got home later that day and checked our account. They billed us extra on our room to include parking, something we already paid for because the guy made us pay cash, not even asking for a receipt from the front desk. The lady on the phone was unrelenting, saying that the parking guy is supposed to give us a receipt. She wanted us to show her a receipt showing we paid for the parking. This entire weekend we were never given a receipt (we never got one when we checked out - most places provide receipts... but apparently this one doesn't because the front desk people don't know how to do their job), so how would we be able to show a receipt that didn't exist? After 5 minutes of convincing her that we paid and that we never were given receipts anyways because of their failure to do their job, she decided to refund us the extra amount they OVER charged us for no reason. How do they even know we used a car in the first place? How to they charge for something that they can't prove we had. SERVICE FAIL #5. I mean, seriously, how difficult is it for CUSTOMER SERVICE professions to actually provide customer service? Apparently it's rather difficult here. Their employees were obviously not chosen accordingly to help improve their customer service. Who ever hired the managers to hire these dumb hourly employees should be fired. I also don' t know if training would even help these employees become better or more equip to perform their jobs. If this hotel has amazing employees, they obviously don't work weekends when a majority of their clientèle are there. This place will forever be marked in my book as the worst place to stay ever. I wouldn't even send my worst enemy to stay here and get the horrible service I did. No one deserves to be subjected to this crap for $200 night.Yes it's true, New York City's hotel rooms are at times on the small side. It's also true to say that at times, even the best hotels can disappoint a jet lagged, tired guest. And yes, it's also fair to say that at times, hype can get the best of us. The Mercer was full so I tried my luck at the Soho Grand. My first and last stay at the Soho Grand combined a tiny cookie-cutter room with completely hopeless customer service and a feeling that the hype brings many first timers and few repeat customers - but as they say, "fools and money...." Location: Great for Soho, not as good as the Mercer, but most of the commercial fun in Soho and surrounds is within walking distance and travel to the hotel from the aiport is easy. The Checkin: Lets face it, the price of top-line hotel rooms has skyrocketed all over the world in the last four years. In some cases spending the money is a joy and in others you feel completely abused. After negotiating my way through the six porters and doorman all of whom were doing nothing but their hair, I entered through the dim, urban lobby and signed my life away on a room rate of a purely insulting $780 per night - good thing I have two kidneys, one is now for sale... This was only after "Sascha" (yes, how typical) had finished her flirtatious interlude with an elderly gentlemen while keeping five guests waiting in line. Conclusion: Checkin is a glamor job fielded by 'trendy', slightly clueless & unprofessional staff who are a touch on the rude side. In short, these guys are glorified cashiers ringing the till and gelling their hair. You get none of the 'chop-chop' and impressive attention to detail from more professional outfits here. The staff want to spot a celebrity so that they're 'with it' everyone else is chopped liver. So having established that the first impression was basically a joke and having my expectation for the room 'managed down' well, we headed upstairs... The Room: Fortuntely there was an area near the ceiling where a piece of rope would have supported my body weight - such was the disappointment. This room looked like somewhere depressed single dudes come to die, or where hookers come to do trade. Cheap, Best Western setup. $780 for a Deluxe King room bought us a (truly) miniscule bathroom, a dirty carpeted floor, a few cheap lamps and bedside tables, a flat screen TV that didn't work, scuffed walls and a very mean little bed. My heart sank as I surveyed the room as I was truly hoping for something special given the great location and price. Strangely, about one quarter of the floor area was taken up a closet like installation which stuck out from the wall, this enroached on the already small room and increased the sense of tight containment - alas I felt like a Soho cockroach in a glass jar. I called down to reception to see if we were given the right room category. After the phone was left on the desk for 3 minutes while the attendant checked (god knows what in that amount of time) I was informed that I had actually been upgraded. Too tired to bother with sarcasm, I hit the shower. Bathroom: Worth a special mention here as a fantastic bathroom can easily make a room and a stay that much more special. In this case, small, cheap & nasty says it all. After 5 seconds in the bathroom I had visions of a mean little hotel baron dressed as the little man with a top hat from Monopoly screaming at his managers 'cut all costs and maximize profits!'. There were no toileteries other than three little bottles of super new age "we hurt no monkeys making this product" body gel and shampoo. The toilet seat was off its hinges. No shower cap, no cotton buds, no bath slippers, only 1 little robe, no cotton wool, no comb, none of the regular things you rarely use, but find comfort in being there and make you feel just a litte bit special. On the plus side, the shower over bath had good water pressure - little problem though, if you have a high pressure shower, make sure you have drainage that can cope with it. Sure enough, after 30 seconds, the bathtub was 3/4 full and I was pretending to be a vietnamese farmer wading through monsoonal rice paddies - "Diddy Mao!" I called this one down to housekeeping and they informed me that in fact the drainage was fine, it wasn't broken and that it was normal - clearly American Idol was mesmerizing that evening as it seemed no one wanted to work for the guests (If only my Doctor could give me an over the phone checkup like this...) Oh by the way and yes you guessed it, the plastic shower curtain (yes plastic) did cling to my body and ofcourse, there was mould around the edges of it. Rather unfortunately, the power outlets DID have safety switches so dropping the hair dryer into my rice paddy bath did not kill me. Truly a shame by this point. The food: Did not trust the kitchen after seeing dirty knives and forks, very wilted lettuce and tired looking food. In short, unimaginative and awful scrapings from Soho gutters. Enough said. Concierge: A really simple job here. Concierge (yes with the by-now-customary five person queue at his/her desk) points towards the shops "over yonder". Anything else forget it. These guys just don't care and don't have a clue compared to switched on concierge desks like The Peninsula in mid town and The Mercer in Soho. Once again for this place, the emphasis on hiring young (and cheap), trendy looking staff comes wayyy ahead of hiring competent people. Conclusion: Checkout said it all to me. Once again a queue of 5 people and a 10 minute wait standing in the lobby. No "we'll be just a minute" or "thanks for waiting, how can I help you". Far from it. They just took the money and offered very little in return. This place is basically a honey trap; first timers and the curious will go and rarely return. Suckers with no appreciation for what service and quality actually is will surely come back. Value for money was non-existant, staff totally hopeless and too few of them, almost no efficiency, dirty scuffed walls and cheap looking rooms supposedly covered up by an expensive fit out downstairs and trendy kids playing "hotelier" for a few years before moving into the media or arts world. Burn this dump to the ground, collect the insurance check and build something that gives guests a feeling of excitment, value and slick prestige. The tradition of Soho has given alot of its sould away to commercialism over the years, the least such commercialism can do then is to honor such a special part of the world by attempting to enchant its guests, not pillage them. Management clearly has alot of work to do here. Oh yes, getting a cab to the airport took 45 minutes despite the six doormen/porters/concierges milling around the outside. Prognosis: Marginally preferable over a park bench and newspapers...I would get more joy smoking bad weed with the $100 bills I used to pay for this place... Where instead: Book the Mercer. Great food, Great location, relliable, big rooms, great bathrooms, smart concierge, smooth checkin/out. Can't go wrong. If The Mercer is full, try Soho House. If no joy there, try a new one called The Bowery.Ok, so when you arrive your like ' Wow, Look at that building!'. The outside is pretty (granite and gold and connected to Symphony hall and located near everything... impressive right?). Then you attempt to park your car :-0 !!! Don't do it! Go directly to the valet because that is who you will use for the rest of your stay! To get in the garage you go up this narrow winding tunnel for about 11 floors! SO Scary!! When you finally get to the garage you would figure the hell is over and you can finally park your car and go to your room, right? Wrong! The parking spaces are narrow as well and so are the lanes to drive past them! Anything bigger then a Geo Metro or Golf Cart is going to have a hell of a time parking! My husband managed to park our Lincoln Towncar after alot of stress (still don't know how he did it... I'm impressed!) and as soon as we got out of the car we heard several other people complaining (several of them with small cars). Anyway it was a Nightmare! Then we headed to the lobby to check in... (you have to get on two seperate elevators every time you go to your room!). When we got to the front desk they thought it was funny that we even managed to park and we immediately signed up for valet parking at $5 extra making parking $25 :-0.... Not Including tipping the valet $5 each time he gets our car! (If he is driving it up and down that spiral... he totally deserves more!!!) Then we finally get to our room and for about 30 minutes, we experience the ooooh and aaaah of look at that view and look at this living room and look at the seperate tub and shower, 2 tv's and french doors leading to the bedroom and microwave and mini bar and room service and so on. Then after being there for about an hour all the awefulness starts kicking in! Two elevators to get our luggage (should have had them bring it... I know that now!). Every time we walked past the front desk (which you will do ALOT since you have to walk past it to get to the second elevator!) the employees were screwing around like little kids! On one occassion I heard them making fun of a guest loudly... totally unprofessional! Then back to the room.... The big blue velvet couch was pretty to look at but when you sat on it, it was very uncomfortable and made a crunchy noise like it was full of newspaper! The desk was all beaten up like it came from a used store! They had food and beverage items in the room that you pay for, which I am ok with but the prices were nuts! $3.50 for a bottle of arrowhead, $3.50 for a kit kat, $3.50 for a little bag of peanuts, $7.00 for a can of beer. Thats all I remember but anyway... nutty prices! The wallpaper was falling off and had a big brown streak across it in the living room (not even curious to know what that was!). The toilet had either a drop of pee or blood on the seat and from there I noticed that the bathroom wasn't clean! When maid services came... was it clean after they came? NOPE! Still dirty in fact they didn't even vaccume (I know because something was still on the floor) and I later found a card that said if you want your sheets changed place this on the bed..... was it placed on the bed before I got there? Who Knows! The sheets were the cheapest most ichy sheets I have ever layed on ($1.99 value at most!), the rest of the bedding was cheap as well. Fancy shampoos and lotions provided? Nope.... Panteen Shampoo and Vasoline Lotion with the Sheraton logo on the other side (good thing I brought better with me! ). The shower had one of those old cloudy glass doors and pink tile and mold everywhere! The shower head leaked badly! The bathroom floor was always wet! When you took a shower in that pink, moldy, dark little closet ... you could here loud trucks driving by on the other side of the wall (I was on the 17 floor). I thought a fridge would be included.... only if you pay extra and request it! This hotel is all about charging you for everything they possibly can! I am surprised toilet paper and pantene were free! Although I wouldn't care to stay at this hotel again.... (I stayed for 2 days) the valet was extremely nice and helpful! The outside of this hotel will impress and so will the lobby if the employees aren't present >:( and this hotel is in a great location! Walking distance from Gaslamp Quarter (which has tons of dining options), Balboa Park, San Diego Zoo, the boat that takes you to Coronado Island and Seaport Village! And only about a 10 minute drive from Sea World. You could almost get away with coming here with no car (would also save you on parking, valet, etc) because there are trolleys and a train nearby. This hotel charges about $199.00 a night I believe and I paid about $94.00 a night (Not Including Parking @$25.00 a night plus tips) through Hotwire. Sadly I still feel ripped off >:( !!I booked this hotel through lastminutetravel.com as a 1 night pre cruise stay. As I always do when a book a hotel on a blind discount travel site, I came to tripadvisor to check the reviews. I noticed right away that there were 2 reviews stating that when they arrived for check-in, they were told that they would not be able to honor their reservation due to current guest staying over because their flights had been canceled. Alarms went off in my head. We had planned to drive down from the Atlanta area after lunch for my wife and kids, it's a 10 hour drive, which would put us in Miami around 10pm. After reading a review here about someone losing their reservation when they had a late check, my wife decided to take the whole day off and let the kids skip the last day of school before the start of Spring Break. I called the Hotel Intercontinental Miami on 3 separate occasions to verify our reservations for a 2 bed double. We received confirmation each time. So, we hit the road at 4 am and arrived at the Hotel InterContinental Miami at 2 pm. The hotel sits on the water front across from Bayside and we were excited, the excitement grew when I entered the beautiful lobby to check in. I stood in line and watched 2 people trying to get checked in get turned away. I over heard the guy in front of me inquiring about the nightly rate, and the clerk informed him that it was $399 per night. I paid $175 plus fees, and I thought here we go. My turn, the clerk takes my name looks at the monitor and confirms that I have a standard double, I agree. Than it happened, she excuses herself and goes into an office, she comes out 3-4 minutes later and drops the bomb. I am sorry , but due to a guest having their flight canceled we are going to move you to a different hotel, you can leave your car parked here and we will pay for a taxi to take you to the Conrad Hotel and pay for another taxi to bring you back to pick up your car in the morning. I told her that was not acceptable, so she asked me if I would like to speak with a manager. So, she is off again to the little room for another 4-5 minutes, now while I am waiting, a young woman gets checked right in, and Ms Natalie Recinos comes out to speak with me. She gives me the same spill about someone having their flight canceled and having to stay over. I explain to her that I don't just a reservation, but a pre paid reservation. If someone has their flight canceled, they should be responsible for finding other accommodations, send them to the Conrad Hotel by taxi. She stated that that's not how they do things, that they have an agreement with the airlines. I asked her, if you are booked solid and don't have any rooms, how was that young women able to check in? Ms.Natalie Recinos states the she was probably a repeat guest or something. I then state that I read on tripadvisor that at least 2 other reviewers reservations were not honored due to flight cancellations, so whats going on here? She apologized again and repeated the offer to pay for a taxi to the Conrad. I told her why would I need a taxi when I drove my own car, she explained that I could leave my car in their valet parking area over night. What sense does that make? I told her that if I was moving, then how was I going to to be compensated for my trouble. She again stated that they would pay for a taxi. What? I told her that I wanted my money refunded and the Hotel InterContinental Hotel should pay for my stay at the Conrad. Well, she agreed. She goes back into the office and brings me out an agreement between the Hotel Intercontinental Miami and the Conrad to take me in. I told her that I want the agreement to refund my nights stay in writing before I leave. She states that she couldn't do that, but she would email it to me, so I write down my email address. I let it go because by this time, my wife and kids have been sitting out in the car for 30 mins waiting for me to get us checked in. I can't prove this, but I believe that the Hotel Intercontinental Miami dishonors discount hotel reservations when there is something large going on in the city, like the tennis tournament going on that week, in order to take in guest paying the full rate. When the hotels are full they bring out the "guest flight was canceled" excuse. Our family of five head on over to the Conrad where the lobby is on the 25th floor by the way. It is a nice art deco kind of hotel. I hand over my letter to clerk from the Hotel InterContinental Hotel, get checked in and head down to the 19th floor. The five of us walk into this tiny room with 1 king sized bed, so we thought that this was obviously an error. We head back up to the lobby to tell the clerk that she had given us a single instead of a double, easy fix we thought. Wrong, the Conrad was booked solid and all they had was a handicapped accessible single room. I asked her if she expected the five of us to sleep in one bed, she stated that she could send a roll away bed to the room and wave the $39 fee.By this time we are both livid and tired, so we acquiesce, and head back down to the room. Then I decided that surely they knew in advance that we were a party of five, so I head back up to the lobby to get a copy of that agreement letter between the Hotel Intercontinental Hotel and the Conrad Hotel for my records. I asked for a copy of that agreement from the front desk clerk, she goes into the little office, stays for about 3 mins and comes back out with a manager stating that they could not provide us with a copy. I asked why not and there was this strained look between the clerk and the manager, and they stated that they just couldn't. We decided to just let it go and go grab an early dinner. Then we found out that every time you leave the hotel parking, you have to pay!!!! It was a very bad start to our Spring Break Cruise, but we had an absolutely wonderful cruise. We contacted lastminutetravel.com and were told that our refund was being processed.I booked the reservation through RCI as I am a Wyndam owner and RCI came with the package unfortunately. This is in no way a Wyndham slam. Wyndham resorts are outstanding, I just wish there were more of them in Florida. Had there been more Wyndham resorts, I would not have landed in what I will refer to as "Motel Hell" aka Silver Lake Resort in Orlando. The only good thing I can remotely come forward with this resort, is that is the location to Disney, but hey....take a look, there are alot of NICE resorts in that area so not such a great or outstanding feature right? You do not need to settle with this type of chaos if you are looking to have a peaceful and relaxing experience. Mine was SO totaly not that. My check in was terrible, the folks at the desk were curt and rude as if I was infringing on their break time. I was cast away like a red headed step child when my reservation was less that what I anticipated or was described to me by RCI. The check in was extremely busy and they did not have enough rep's to cover the need. Can you say WAIT? I had to wait a long time to get the mishap resolved. Ohhhhh if only RCI would have been honest and up front with me regarding this room or lack there of, all of this could have been avoided. But RCI was not. After all who is gonna sell you on a dump? But it's a really great deal! DO NOT FOLLOW THEIR ADVICE! RCI was not forth coming with the fine print right off the bat, thus leading to my check in troubles....It SO could have been avoided if RCI were to have been looking out for it's members. I was told it was a very nice resort and was a great deal to boot and that I should take it now while it was available as it would not last the hour. I SOOOOOO wished I had passed on this "deal" as it was a vacation nightmare. Had they told me we have occupancy in a lower rated facility, I would have thanked them and stayed home. Look at the testimonials, not much has changed at this resort in the last year. If you are an RCI member take their description of resorts with a grain of salt.....do your own research...they have not stayed there themselves, I would bet. in fact I told Matt, manager of RCI customer service that if Silver Lake were to offer me a complimentary week stay I would give it to some one I hate. I offered it to him even. I had 2 br/2ba accomodations and upon first inspection it did look relatively nice. The grounds were almost decent and the rooms looked adequately furnished but worn. The mirrors definately told the age, or lack of a qualified interior decorator. The lack of a disco ball left me wondering and what exactly was that stain on the comforter? The amenities were less than that of a Motel 8 or La Quinta and that is not saying much for a "star" rated resort. Starting with the room.....is it electrical or do they just not take the time to check the light bulbs? My "light" went out at that point and I shook my head in disgust. What are they paying the hired help for any way, atleast those that could actually speak english? Did they not understand " NO LIGHT....LIGHT OUT?" Or can they not see? The elevator went out conveniently as I returned with groceries. While talking to the elveator repair technician he indicated that this is routine for this resort. I am thinking in the back of my mind....Gosh what if? What if I was on the 4th floor for heavens sake, and the elevator was out for who knows how long. My son who is diagnosed with autism, freaks out on stairwells and heaven forbid the building cought on fire for faulty wiring. I felt extremely concerned and unsafe in a relatively new building. Would I be trapped in an elevator with my disabled son at any moments notice? Well you might have guessed that I was not only concerned but very scared. I hardly slept the nights I was there. The card keys may have worked 1 out of every 30 attemps which would not have been all that bad but the halls are not air conditioned and in Florida, it was a feels like temp of 150 degrees. I was told the room included certain things that were half true. Did the person in charge of lights check this as well? There was no DVD/ VCR player at all. The TV did have a few reconizable channels you could actually tolerate watching and the rest were full of static and snow or I was left with a blue screen of death. That is only of course considering I received any TV service at all. The Toilets scared me as they flushed with such force I was afraid not to put the lid down or I may very well be covered with Pooh! EWWWW! They did have a small game room that ran on tokens which would have been almost medioker but the token machine did not work so that was a HUGE bust. We ended up going to Orange Lake ( a light up the road) to participate in activites and have some actual fun) I am a week owner there so I have full acccess year round. The activities at Silver Lake were a joke. The walls were paper thin and I could hear the young family next door like they were in my lap. The baby screaming and crying at all hours only to be muffelled by the electric guitar and all the vibrations the woofer brought on. What did I hear from the staff or RCI about all this? NOTHING! and we are only on day #2 here. It went south from there at a rapid speed. And you were thinking it could not get worse right? Well I called RCI yet again to complain as the resort obviously did not care and I was told by RCI management that if I was so unhappy with the resort that they would be happy to have Silver Lake Resort Security escort me off the property....yeah folks you got that right. My my son who heard the phone converstation was convinced the resort police were "coming to get him" because he acted up to the constant screaming of the neighbors and their lovely electric guirtars. I spent the next few hours trying to calm him down and coax him out from under the bed. Despite my attemps to satisfaction, I turned to my son at day 3 and asked him if we could return home. like many other Silver Lake guests we doing. He told me not to give up. At this point I do not know who was worse, dealing with Silver Lake or RCI?this is my review of quite frankly the most useless hotel I have ever encountered. please see my letter to them below and pics attached. read from the top down (incl the farcical response) part 1 Dear Sir/Madam I wish to complain about the treatment received and lack of quality with regard to my stay in the Central Park Hotel from the 11th August for 2 nights. Myself and my partner had arrived in London having been up from 3am british time flying from Palma. Having lugged our bags around we eventually got to the hotel around 3-4pm physically and mentally exhausted. We had requested a double room and arrived to find a small twin room which had any space possible taken up by our bags (which the concierge or anyone else didnt offer to help with). We immediately requested a change of room from 417 I believe and were then switched to 517 (I am not 100% certain of the numbers) which was again miniscule. It began to get even better, as we noticed a power box of some sort right directly behind the bed which I would imagine would surely be a safety hazard. There was also a loose skirting board and bits of carpet not laid properly with threads clearly visible and parts of it partially ripped. Having lifted the duvet it was clear the bed was also not clean judging by the amount of hair in it. I congratulate you for having the first bed I have ever seen in need of a shave! The pictures of the above are attached! We immediately rang reception who promised to get housekeeping to contact us, 15 minutes later having not heard a word we decided to go back to reception and complain. At this stage we were very tired, our bags had been lugged around all day to the point where it felt like an extra body part(s). We told reception we were extremely disappointed with this treatment as we were very tired from travelling and had hoped to rest and wash before meeting friends. We had now changed rooms twice which was a waste of time given the 3rd room was again miniscule (700 and something). Once again no discount/major apology was offered and once more we had to lug our bags again as the staff didnt offer to (concierge was watching sky at this point). This experience has made me extremely angry and frustrated and certainly put a huge downer on my trip to London, things didnt improve as the staff then just ignored us for the rest of the trip even when we made the effort to say hello. Manners dont cost much do they? This included the cleaning staff who didnt even acknowledge us and one member of staff seeing me come out of the lift and turning their back! I began reading some more reviews on my phone which were surprisingly good until I discovered that despite having a concierge there was no facilites to look after our bags until it was time for us to make our way to Gatwick on our check out day. This turned out to be true when we enquired. We again complained that it was the least that could be done given our issue with the rooms and the money we paid (€213 not the dearest price, but it is dear when you consider how much we had to save given our bills, only for I had already been charged through Otel.com I would have left the hotel minutes after arriving). Although I was told facilities are not provided to store bags, I fail to see the purpose of a concierge who from what I can see did absolutely nothing other than watch sky and couldnt even speak english! The reception staff in trying to explain muttered and mumbled a half hearted apology which just made me leave in utter frustration (to lug our bags around once more, to Victoria at a cost of £25). This most defintely the cherry on top of an awful experience which more or less ruined my trip to London. This merely describes my anger and utter frustration with the rooms and the service and staff from the hotel, I am utterly disgusted with the treatment received. I would most defintely not recommend this hotel to anyone! That said I would welcome your comments and a response to this, (an offer of a refund wouldnt go amiss) otherwise I would certainly have no problem in posting this or my views to deter any future visit for anyone across the world on the many websites I use to book hotels (and I am not talking just about tripadvisor or facebook). Given my experience of working in the Government for over a decade I would also certainly not hesitate to contact a local representative or Government Minister to highlight the issues I have raised. I await your response. Yours Sincerely PART 2 Dear Sir, Thank you very much for your email. First you have booked a room in the quiet zone which is in the basement and is a room without windows. But we have allocated a nice standard room which was not up to your expectations and as a courtesy we have moved you to an executive room on the 7thfloor for which the rate is 50% higher than the room you have booked. I refer you to our website which clearly shows that we don’t offer luggage storage facilities and concierge service. And I must attract your attention that we are a 3*** hotel, not a 4**** or a 5***** deluxe. On your next visit to Central Park Hotel please contact me personally and I will be there to welcome you and make sure you get a very nice, executive room at no extra cost. Kind Regards, ********************* Front Office Manager Central Park Hotel 49/67 Queensborough Terrace London W2 3SY PART 3 (which has not been responded to) dear xxxx, Thank you for your response. I am confused as how you came to the conclusion that I booked a room in the basement without windows? The rooms were on the 4th and 5th floors and did have windows. You then suggest that I was moved to the 7th floor into an executive room yet it didnt look at all different from either of the other 2 rooms I declined. Your explanation that "we are a 3*** hotel, not a 4**** or a 5***** deluxe. " is true but I can clearly see that from the site and it is almost as if you are saying that as an explanation for things being so poor. I didnt expect a 5 star hotel and a presidential suite but I certainly expect a lot better from a hotel I pay over 100 Euros a night for. The 2 star travelodge I stayed in near Gatwick airport had a room twice the size for £19, whilst its not exactly the centre of London, it was much better value. I also note that you say you dont provide a concierge service yet there is a picture of it on the main site, as they didnt look after the bags/or even offer any assistance to us, I am not sure what the purpose of it was. Whilst your site does not indeed advertise that it stores luggage I would have assumed that this was a basic service provided as it has been in probably every hotel I have ever stayed in. There is also no reference in your email to explain 1. The attitude of staff. 2. The safety hazard of the second room. 3. The appearance of the room with the carpet. 4. The bed being covered in hair! Again, I would welcome your response. signed xxxI should of known it was going to be bad when I read all the reviews here. I usually come here and read and when the majority is bad I change hotels... it seems the last few people gave it the thumbs up so we went with it. We went to Maui for my brothers wedding. There are a lot of hotels in Maui that dont even advertise on the net and I wish I would of stayed elsewhere. I called the hotel a few days before we left. We live on the east coast and it was going to be a LONG day and I did not want anything left to chance... first of all I called five times trying to get to the *reservations department* guess what? they only have ONE PERSON for the entire building that could handle the reservation... her name is Michelle and she is very very hard to get a hold of. She wont return voice mail so I kept on till I got a hold of her. I wanted to make sure she had us down and we had asked for a King smoking room... she said yes we had both in the computer. First of all this condo building has very high prices and advertises oceanfront... I have traveled the world including Oahu but have never been to Maui and ONLY went because of the wedding. It seems Maui is one over priced adventure and all in all I will never go back there. We went to the store and a box of cereal is $5.00 and yes this was at Safeway not some small gas station. The beach sucks at this hotel. It is a small plot of blackish brown dirt with lots of rocks...NOT like Waikiki which is white sand and blue water. The ocean was dark and murky green and nasty and muddy ground that will suck you down if your not careful. Ok we drove from the airport in the dark due to a four hour travel delay out of LAX... it was dark and we needed directions...the hotel was clueless on how to tell us how to get there and we eventually just followed highway 30 to Lahaina and actually the hotel is in Kahana up the road... also when I was on the phone with them at home they said many places to eat just walking distance across the street...that is a total lie. They have a Mcdonalds which for two people costs $11-15 dollars ordering value meals.... that is the closest place to eat then they have a outback steack house and thats it. You have to DRIVE everywhere if you want something to eat or go to the store and cook on your vacation. There is NO gift shop or convenience store located on the property so come prepared with band aids, aspirin, drinks ect ect... the parking sucks its all close together jammed with a million rental cars and every night at least three times a rental car alarm would go off for a minute straight. We checked in and the girl working the desk said yes we had a smoking room and a king bed... dont look for a bell hop...they dont have any. We lugged our stuff upstairs and it was a NON smoking room with a queen bed and a twin bed... I called down for a ashtray... yes we are smokers and I like to keep things cleaned up and not drop ashes in the sink or out on the deck... we had to use a gatorade bottle and asked for three days in a row and never got a ashtray....the next person said we were in a non smoking room so I told her to check with the person who checked us in because we had already smoked in the room for two days... Im saying all this because for a person who is allergic to smoke they would not be happy checking in after a smoker. The room was basic and the carpets were dirty. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen and reminded me of my last visit to London with the small baths in the hotels there. The bathroom also has NO a/c and no fan...they want you to crank open these acient window slats to get the hot humid air so you will sweat to death after your bath or shower. The toilet ran for two days straight as the chain was getting caught up on a piece of plumbing that was falling apart so everytime someone used the toilet you had to remove the lid and untangle the mess. We reported this to the front desk and no one ever came to straighten it out. They have a very tiny pool for all the guests to use... you think it would be larger or they would have at least two of them. My other family members stayed at other hotels around Lahaina and Kannapoli... we had the dumpiest hotel and everyone was suprised to see the lack of facilites including a sauna that does not work and a dusty small workout room. We spent a lot of money to stay at this dump and I would not recommend it to anyone and NO this was not our cheapest option. Maui all in all is totally overpriced and I would take our favorite spot which is Cancun which is closer and better and all inclusive for a fraction of the price over Maui anyday of the week. They have a lot of overpriced tourist things to do and we knew better then to pay $200 to bike down Haleakala at the crack of dawn.... if you want to do these things SHOP AROUND.... I saw Lu'aus for $19.00 at the Marriot (my sister stayed here) and my family went to the Old Lahaina Lu'ua for my brothers reception which was sooo boring and it was $85.00 a person plus tax and gratuity.... this is my fifth Lu'ua and it was not worth the money and the meal was just so so... downtown Lahaina they have many places to book parasailing, biking the volcano, snorkeling, L'uaus ect ect DONT GET RIPPED OFF... we drove everyday to get to a decent beach and stayed away from the sharks who are dying to take your money. If anyone has any questions please email me.. I speak nothing but the truth... read back and see I was not the only one who thinks this is a really crappy condo building with really crappy service and facilities.Over priced, overrated....stay away!Went to spend New Year's in Miami with a friend, and to watch the Orange Bowl Game. The week of going to be in Miami, we were searching for hotels, and wanted to stay in downtown. Reading lots of the horror story reviews of this hotel, we both were apprehensive about booking a stay there. One of the reviews which still sticks with me is that housekeepers steal clothes from the rooms, and nothing was done about it. Check in was fine. Once we checked in the room, it had an odd musty odor. We quickly got ready to enjoy a night out on the town for NYE celebration. Upon returning to the room around 4:00 a.m., I noticed there was no "Do Not Disturb" sign, and the door had no lock! No security chain, or dead bolt. Meaning, hotel staff members could come and go as they pleased in our room. I pulled back my sheets, and there was what I dubbed "the mystery spot." It smelled like feces, and the bed was visably wet. We called the front desk, and they said there was nothing they could do about it. I ended up sleeping on the foot of the bed to avoid being on the wet spot. Around 3:00 p.m. I heard a noise. I thought it was my friend in the restroom, and my friend says to me loud "Hey, trying to sleep off my hang over. Keep it down!" I tell him "...That isn't me making the noise." We both sit up in bed, and see the light on in the restroom, and the door ajar. A housekeeper comes out, and we look at each other. I told her "No service please." She responded in spanish "I don't speak English." Lucky my friend spoke fluent spanish, and told her we didn't need the restroom clean, and told her about the wet spot on my bed. She rolled her eyes, walked over to the spot, and she says "Your friend probably vomited in his sleep. That's what this is." He told her that the bed was like that when we got back from the club. She insisted that it was my fault. She stepped on my white shirt I had worn out, and she said "Sorry" and picked it up. "Oops" she said in English, and my shirt was now that brown color of the mystery spot. She touched the carpet, and it was wet also. I hadn't noticed that when we checked in, because it was on the side of the bed. I walk over near the housekeeper, and the musty smell was overwhelming. It smelled like urine. We called the front desk and asked to be moved to another room, but according to the hotel, they had "no rooms available," and the room we booked was only available on that floor. I was really upset about her getting my white shirt stained, and there was not even a "Let me wash your shirt sir" or anything. She made my bed, just put three matress pads, two towels, then the cover sheet over the wet spot. She said to my friend "I put enough layers on it, so it shouldn't soak through." Needless to say I went to the front desk and raised hell about it. The only staff member Guillermo (goes by english version of his name "Will" or "William) apologized. I said I was very upset the housekeeper was so blunt and implied it was my fault. I asked about the no locks on the door, and the female co-worker of his said only suites have the do not disturb sign and dead bolt/security chain. After going out to dinner and exploring Miami, we returned to the room to get ready for another fun night out. I had noticed my suitcase was partially unzipped, because a sleeve of one of my shirts was sticking out. I started to panic. I knew what was had happen. Perhaps out of spite, the housekeeper didn't like my comment to her from earlier in the day, and returned after we left and took two more pairs of my white shirts. I called the front desk, and demanded to talk to the manager, or someone of higher authority. Nothing was done!! I ended up going to a store to buy some more white shirts, and locks for my luggage. My friend did the same also. He was lucky and nothing was stolen from him. This hotel is just for sleeping only. Don't expect anything fancy. The ONLY nice person on staff was Guillermo. Other comments. I wrote post cards, and there was a outgoing mail bin at the front desk. I put my cards in there, and the woman took them out and gave it back to me. "Sorry, for hotel staff only." What a b*itch! As I was leaving the hotel to head to the airport, Guillermo asked what happen, I told him. His face got red with angry. He apologized, and said he would gladly send my postcards off in the mail. He went back inside, and I could see him getting into an argument with the woman. He came back out, and apologized for her actions. When I had stayed there in January, only one of the elevators worked. They do have a very outdated computer near the elevator for guest to use. It was so slow, and outdated, it couldn't load sites like google maps, or mapquest. If you're looking for a cheap room, then stay here, but be cautioned! I only gave the service a "Average" rating, because of how nice Guillermo was in handling our needs. He booked us a tour of the Everglades, always greeted us and other guest in respectful manners. Anyone else, were rude. The pool was closed, even though it was in the 70's and humid on some days. The view we had from our room was nice. The AC didn't work either. TV stations came and went. Some days ESPN would work, other days it came in snowy. Hotel is in a "okay" location. Was hard to get a cab there. We didn't have a car, we stayed on foot. About a 10 minute walk to American Airlines Arena, and the Bayside Mall.As part of a planned trip to Italy this hotel was booked on the basis of its price and TA ranking. We like our creature comforts and very rarely stay below 3 stars so when we saw that three nights at the Castello would be les than three hundred pounds and was four stars as well we booked straight away in Nov 07. We booked through Lastminute.com and selected a deluxe double with spa and continental breakfast. When we set off on a driving tour of Italy some 10 months later I took into account recent reviews that mentioned the hotel being hard to find. I printed off the Google arial photo of the hotel and surrounding roads as well as programming it into my sat nav. We arrived in Rome around 2pm via the A1 motor way and the city ring road. As the sat nav counted down to less than two miles to go we spotted the first of many signs to the hotel and followed it - straight into a dead end. A housing estate had been built since the photo used by google had been taken or the software for my satnav had been written. Several false trys led nowhere but dead ends. We therefore ignored the satnav and tried another of the roads on the map. Again as we got near there were more signs but this time the road ended in a quarry. A third attempt coming in from the north along Via Cassia finally got us to the hotel, after an hour of driving around and around. Sorry to go on but this set the scene for the rest of the stay. The former castle is certainly an impressive sight but from the outside has no signage at all to indicate where the front door is or directions to reception. Only a delivery taking place gave away that the heavy iron gates in the front of the building are the main door. The reception staff were typically Italian in their aloof manner and made us feel that I was an inconvenience to their work. The member of staff dealing with us even ignored us for a moment to sign the delivery mans papers despite three other members of staff standing around. When we got to our room it was stiflingly hot. The A/C had not been switched on. Further more our prebooked spa bath was a bog standard one under the window with a shower over it. I went straight back to reception to query this. I was told in a very matter of fact way that Lastminute.com had incorrectly listed the room facilities and that the hotel had informed them of this numerous times. The mention of a spa was in fact free access to the hotel spa facilities - swimming pool - and not a jacuzzi bath as the blurb suggested. To compound things it later became evident that the location of the bath against the window prevented a curtain being hung there. Therefore if you needed to have a shower after dark you had to do so with the light off for fear of people outside seeing you in the bath room. There are rooms available with jacuzzi baths but only those costing a great deal more per night. The rest of the room was clean but otherwise like many business hotels. there is a mini bar, barely effective A/C unit and a safe but no iron or trouser press and no coffee making facilities. Our room,211, overlooked the terrace used by restaurant guests and so included their chatter and noise. The large swimming pool to the rear of the hotel was down eleven flights of precariously steep stairs. On the first night we went into Rome on the train returning around 8.30pm to take dinner in the restaurant. we were advised that we should have booked in advance, despite being a guest there and there being no other places to eat within three miles! When we were eventually seated it was in amongst a large Italian family gathering celebrating a 25th wedding anniversary. The starter of Gnocchi was plentiful but of one flavour throughout the dish. My wifes seafood ravioli starter was again plentiful and she was impressed by the many tastes it gave her. For our mains we both had veal dishes with roasted eggplant and mozzarella. Thats exactly what we got. A fatty piece of meat, two pieces of roasted aubergine topped with grated mozzarella and a piece of stuffing. the portion size was small and swimming in grease. We asked for a bottle of house red to go with it and were served a bottle of chianti called "Oddone". Breakfast the following morning was little better. Scrambled eggs and bacon were the only hot options. the rest being apple croissants - no plain ones or pan chocolate, There was choice of cold meats that you had to slice yourselves along with cheese in a similar manner. This was all taken whilst lift music was played into the room. The second night we took dinner in Rome but returned to find another wedding reception on and the only parking place available at the bottom of the very steep hill to the rear of the hotel. Nine flights of steep steps back to our room were not what we wanted after a long day on the tourist trail. Day three was much the same but this time it was scrambled eggs and sausage. On the evening another wedding that went on until 1am with noisey vocal guests and fireworks outside our window. On the face of it this impressve looking four star establishment is ideal for those that want silver service meals by waiters in white tunics or if you want a fairytale wedding location. If like me you want four star accomodation for a base from which to explore Rome then look elsewhere. It is 90 minutes and two trains to the Rome Termini station, impossible to find and treats non italian guests in a less favourable fashion.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

Take a moment to consider that I travel ALL YEAR, and stay in dozens of hotels all over the country in the $49-79 price range. This hotel has all outside entrances, which is generally a bad sign. We arrived to find a heavy mildew smell that immediately made me realize I'd made a bad choice in picking this hotel. Upon quick inspection it looked like the room was kept just clean enough to be acceptable to a tired and road-weary guest that didn't feel like putting up a fight. As noted in several reviews this hotel was plagued with what the locals call "love bugs" ; little soft-bodied black bugs that are hooked together mating...EVERYWHERE. They were supposedly brought into Florida by a University to help control the mosquito population, and now they are out of control. They were swarmed all over the property to the extent that we couldn't lay out at the pool and relax without them covering us, and there were plenty of them in our room and even in the bed. When this was brought to the property manager's attention, (via phone call)his response was a canned; "This is Florida, they are everywhere". Amazingly enough, we didn't see them anywhere at Disney, (where they spray for bugs for the comfort of their guest). The carpeting in our room was old and dingy. While taking my first shower, I noted the bottoms of my feet were black from mildew after walking barefoot in the room. The bed was old, but a thin mattress pad was added to try to extend the life a little longer. The T.V. armoire was big and beautiful, and had plenty of storage for clothing and accessories. The lamps were old and out-dated, and one of them had to be smacked a few tiimes to keep the light on. Upon leaving the room on day 1, I flagged the housekeeper who was cleaning the room next door to let her know we were out of our room for the day. She didn't speak English so I pointed at our room and gestured we were leaving and it was OK to clean our room. Upon returning later that evening our bed was hurriedly put together, the cup of coffee we had left on the nightstand was dumped all over the nightstand and the cup was on the floor. Our new towels were thrown on the racks as if they were in a speed-housekeeping competition, and there was no new packets of coffee or bars of soap left. Day 2, upon leaving I flagged a couple of housekeepers that were talking out front of our room to let them know we were leaving, none of them spoke English either. We did however get housekeeping that day, and it was much better than day one. The only thing left untouched were the bugs stuck in the cobwebs attached to the window curtain, not complaining, I think they kind of added to the room's decor. The entrance to the lobby is made of large windows that look as if they hadn't been cleaned in years. The front desk staff was cordial, and there was a man (maybe the manager?) that staffed an information desk and tries to sell you tickets to local atractions. He seemed quite dissapointed when I declined. There must be a fat commission on selling tickets in Kissimmee, everywhere we went aggressive sales people were trying to sell us tickets. As far as vending machines, there are several Coca-cola machines on the premises for a $1.50 each. There is a grocery store directly across the street, so I recommend stocking your mini in-room fridge on your first night. The Chinese restaurant built in the same parking lot was good (for buffet food), but dinner was $11.95 + drink & tip per person, very pricey for limited selection and NO SUSHI. According to the coupon-clipper magazine I got at the information desk, there are several more Chinese buffets with much more selection and cheaper just down the road. If you like Japanese/Hibachi, I strongly recommend "Kaburi". For lunch, Hibachi chicken is $6.50, and includes vegetables, rice, lo-mein, and the salad station. Drinks are additional. The Hibachi steak was only $7.95. The food quality was excellent, and our chef was very friendly. Be sure to clip your coupon for 10% off. As for this hotel, this will be our last stay here. Unfortunately, it looks like most of the hotels on the main drag (Hwy. 192) weren't really kept up. Kissimmee looks like a town that is soley based on tourism and is slowly dying. There are many hotels that are vacant and out of business up and down this highway, and it looks like the general maintenance of most businesses are of the by-gone era. If you're in this area and need a hotel, spend the extra $100-200 for your entire stay, and get a 3-star hotel elsewhere. You won't regret missing the money as much as ruining your well-deserved vacation.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

I checked in on Thursday, 10 June, and I am scheduled to check out on Monday, 14 June. We were staying there for our Anniversary trip. Our room was supposed to be pre-paid on 07 June in an amount of $467.04. On 12 June, we noticed that the charge for the room was not billed but an authorization for $722.80 was being held on the account. The authorization for $722.80 consisted of $467.04 for the room and $255.80 for incidentals. Here is the problem. The front desk manager told us that the Westin tried to bill our debit card on 07 June and the card declined. I know this is not true because I called my bank and the transaction never tried to come through and the funds were always there there anyway. I asked the front desk manager for a transaction number from the bank that was given from the alleged decline and she was unable to provide that transaction number. The other part of the problem is that the Westin alleges that since our debit card was declined on 07 June, they charged us a higher amount for incidentals. Usually, incidentals are $100 but when a card is declined this amount increases to $100 per day. This makes no sense because if the lesser amount, $467.04, was allegedly declined, then how can the Westin authorize the higher amount of $722.80? If the smaller amount was allegedly unavailable then the higher amount should have never been able to be authorized if, indeed, the funds were unavailable. The funds were always available. Also, if this policy is true this further makes no sense because if we were supposed to be charged a $100 per day incidental rate since the card allegedly declined, then why were incidentals authorized at $255.80 instead of $400 ($100 per day for 4 days, the length of my reservation). This is the bottom line, our debit card was authorized at a higher amount for incidentals since the room and tax amount allegedly declined. So, we were penalized for a decline that never happened. And, it appears that the Westin just pulled a figure for incidentals out of the sky since the higher/penalized incidental rate does not even match the rate in the Westin policy. The front desk manager told us there was nothing she could do since it was Saturday and she told us we could call the general manager. So, I called the general manager, David Smith, and talked to him about our concerns. David Smith was beyond terrible. He told me that he was not at the hotel, that he was in New York City and if the front desk manager said there was nothing she could do then nothing could be done. He proceeded to tell me that he would not do anything to address my concern and when I checked out everything would balance out. He told me that he would not make any calls to Westin at a higher level to see how this happened; he also proceeded to tell me that even if he was willing to make some calls nothing could be done today since it's Saturday. His unwillingness to even address my concern was appalling. Before I left the front desk, the front desk manager ended up calling higher level Westin and the authorization was released and she billed the debit card for the room and tax. Funny how she was able to do that when she and her general manager told me that nothing could be done. Technically, my issue was resolved but I am writing this review because of the horrible way David Smith talked to me on the phone. We could have taken our business anywhere, but we chose to come to the Westin. What a mistake !! Is this Westin policy? Does the Westin not train their management staff in customer service? My request was for the Westin to correct an error that they made and all I received was disrespect and lack of concern. I expected him to at least be willing to investigate the issue, but he told me he would not do anything. I don't work directly in customer service but I am expected to address the concerns of those who are impacted by what I do and the decisions I make. I try my best to be responsive and professional because that is my job and it's just common courtesy, This is a fairly new property and if the Westin continues to treat their customers this way they won't be around for long. At this point, we have no interest in ever staying at a Element by Westin property. We would much rather spend our money at a property where the management has a willingness to address concerns and/or operate in accordance with the policies and procedures of the organization. Perhaps that's why the customer service was so bad because there is no structure in the organization. We are so disappointed. We don't make a habit of paying people to disrespect us. Apparently a paying customer has little significance until a review like this is written. A very sad state.Beautiful grounds- everything else is sub-standard My friends and I planned a 2 week stay at the Melia Caribe Tropical in Punta Cana through Expedia. Everything was included- transportation to and from, airfare, hotel etc. We read many good reviews and some bad ones but decided to go with this one because of the price and the beautiful pictures. There was a total of 10 people aged 19-36, 2 singles and 4 couples. Upon touchdown at the airport, which really looked like a third world airport we were forced to pay $10 per person entry fee for a stamp in our passport, after waiting 2 hours in long lines of all the other people waiting to get that stamp. Let me tell you- there is no airconditioning and it is very hot and musty in DR. After that nightmare, we went on our bus to be driven to the hotel. The bus which made about 6 stops, took over 2 hours. We went to the RS check-in which bypassed all the lines and they told us we could go straight to the Royal Service lounge and check in. OK we did, but we had to carry our own bags- not something from a 5 star hotel/resort. We didn't complain. Upon arriving in the Royal Service lounge, we were notified that our rooms had been double booked. Not a big deal as we have experienced this before in even 5 star hotels around the world. However, when they could not verify our information and blamed the confusion on us and left us to make our own telephone calls to Expedia we flipped out. But surprise surprise- we were not the only ones there with the same problem. Two other couples were arguing with the manager (a real B ****) because they were charged for calls they never made and because they had such a terrible time there! We waited 4 hours until matters got cleared up and they verified us! 4 HOURS! NO APOLGY, NO DISCOUNTS OR UPGRADES and we got no compensation! In any event, they took our bags to the rooms (Building 5, rooms 5206-5214 if I remeber correctly) and we got on a golf cart to move 100 feet to the other side of the pool. They took the long way! In the room, the A/C was OFF and the room was musty and hot and sticky. Not 5 star, not even 3 star service. Before the bell boy put the bags down he had his hand out for money. We gave him $1 each- $1 too much. That was the start of a bad trip- one that we cut short from two weeks to 9 days! Here's the summary-Grounds- very clean and beautiful. The pools are great. Very clean. The pathways can be very slippery so be careful. The grounds are HUGE! You need 20-30 minutes to walk from one side to the other and everywhere is clean. They have a trolly train that goes arounf from time to time and you see many workers on motor scooters but they puff black cancer causing smoke into the air. Rooms- clean sheets and bedding. Comfortable mattress. We had 2 small flat screen TV's which were ok but no so clear and only had 8 channels. The bathroom was very big and nicely designed. The jaccuzzi bath is large and new. The seperate shower w/ glass door was very nice but there was some mold around the bottom tiles and mold around the sink. For the most part the room was ok, 4 star. The A/C does not work all the time. At one time the A/C cut out in the middle of the night and they repaird it by lunch the next day but it still was never cool in the room. Also it is very humid and sticky so your clothes does not dry- in fact it always feels damp and musty. A nice point was the RS has a pillow menu with different pillows but they book quick and you can only get 1 type per room. Also with Royal service they pick you up with Golf carts- LOL it a joke. You would be lucky if you seen one that will pick you up every 5 hours! BTW, RS gives you a special braclet to wear and when the driver sees this they are supposed to pick you up- MOST of them just ignore you. Food- HORRIBLE. And that is not just my opinion but all of the guests that were with us. Each of us became sick at least 1 night during the first 4 days- vomiting and diarrhea. Pepto Bismol costs $20! CAUTION- the store there is the biggest rip off ever. We ate in:-La gondola- ok italian and the best restaurant there-Ma Masion- French food gone bad- we probably got sick there-The American Grill- terrible-La Hacienda- bland, boring and small portions-Hokkaido- Japanese food thats not real Japanese and poor quality- we also got sick from thisService- HORRIBLE. We give service 1 star. It takes 2 hours to have our door unlocked when the lock battery died! Not acceptable.Value- it rates poor, 1 star. We left feeling ripped off. The price is good when looking for 5 star service but you really get 2 star service. The managers are RUDE and don't care about you. They have no concept of what it means to serve. I think part of the problem is they are poor Dominicans and they look at Americans as rich spoiled brats and they feel they don't have to serve you-- that being said, NOT EVERYONE was bad. Some workers actually worked hard and we gave them a $10 per day tip.Everyone else, from house cleaning to guest services is rude and they ONLY want your money. Do not go on any excursions. We went on a quad excursion for $90 each for a 6 hour tour- what we got was broken quads with non-function brakes that were downright dangerous. In the end, we would NEVER go to this hotel or any Sol Melia resort anywhere in the world after what we went through. The whole reason I am writing this is because of this experience and because after writing several letters to complain we got NO RESPONSE from anyone in the actualy hotel- we did get a response from corporate and they gave us a free 3 night stay with any 3 night purchase- thanks but no thanks. Even if they paid for the entire trip we would say NO WAY JOSE!If you are used to 1 star service this may be an upgrade for you- its 2 star overall including the beautiful grounds. Avoid this place at all costs if you have experienced other good places around the world. This has to be the absolute 2nd worst place (after World of Wonders Resort in Turkey which takes honors as the WORST PLACE ON EARTH)Sol Melia, we award you 2nd place for the WORST VACATION EXPERIENCE EVER. Congrats.This is the first time I have put anything on the trip advisor .we booked to stay in the Riviera hotel in Las Vegas from the 14/9/2011-29/9/2011,we have stopped in this hotel for the last few years, going twice a year for a total of 30 days in total each year. We booked with Expedia and paid extra for the encore room (Monte Carlo tower) where we always stay, had read some bad reviews since it was taken over this year but thought some people just like to moan and have always enjoyed the hotel every time we stayed there. On arrival we had to wait 45 minutes in line to book in a lot of people were complaining about their rooms. When it was our turn we gave the receptionist our booking and she said fine and then said that will be $111 for resort fees we said we always pay that when we leave to which she replied it is now paid when you book in, so we paid it, she then said you can’t have the encore room and we said we paid for an encore room and that’s what we want, she said no one is staying in that tower as work is being done to upgrade that tower, we were not happy and she said that we were to be upgraded to a better room we said no thanks we just want what we paid for, she said at least look at the room, so we went to see it .it was in the Monaco tower and the room was a lot smaller with the old type of noisy air conditioning unit it also had a connecting door, but more to the point these rooms cost less than the encore, so we went back down and said we don’t want the room, she said that’s all we have take it or leave it. I just looked at her and said get me the reception manager and was told that she was on her break for the next hour, by this time I had had enough so I said are you sure that no one is staying in the Monte Carlo tower and she said yes, so I replied well the workmen must be staying in the rooms then as we saw lights on and people in the rooms when we passed, so I will just go up and check to see who comes out of the rooms and ask them if they are guests shall I, she then said that what she meant was that no more rooms were being let out in that tower so that work could start in that tower, I said we booked with you 6 months ago so why were we not told this, she replied not our problem and anyway it’s a first come first served basis and as you didn’t book with us direct it’s not our problem, speak to your tour operator it’s their problem, I just said what’s the name of your manager she said Annette, I said tell Annette we will be back to see her. We went back and had to stand in line again while 4 people in front of us were complaining to Annette, when we got to speak to her she was very offhand with us and I said we are not stopping in that room and I do not like being lied to and told her what had gone on previously she just looked at us and I said well, my wife said so we are at a stalemate and I said we have been travelling for 18 hours so get me the c.e.o. of the casino, she said that he was only in charge of the casino and I said well he is in overall charge of the whole casino of which this is a part, she then said that we would have to wait until the next morning to speak to him, and I said well we do now have a problem as we will not stop in that room and we have stopped in this hotel on numerous occasions and if you check your records it will prove that we always stay in an encore room, she went away and was some time when she came back it was with a totally different attitude, she then gave us a key to a room in the south tower room 763 the room was bigger but had a connecting door and the air conditioning was making a lot of noise, so we went back and said no, she then gave us the key to room 761 same room but next door it looked better than the last room, by this time we could hardly keep our eyes open, so we took that room, on checking the bed found it had only 2 sheets on it, no cover, blanket or duvet, so we rang housekeeping and had one sent up. I wish that we could say that was the end of it but no. Next morning after a sleep we checked out the room and it was terrible very badly run down and furniture covers all ripped, air condition unit filters had not been cleaned for years so the unit not working right. There was water on the floor at the bath (later found out that the toilet was leaking) when we complained about it you would think that all you had to say was that it was leaking please fix it, no I had to explain in detail where it was leaking from, I felt like saying just send me up the tools and I will fix it myself .the fridge was coated in filth and set to highest output controls ripped out so totally iced up. We stuck it out for 2 days but had had enough, so we booked into other hotels downtown (main street station, Freemont, Fitzgerald’s and the Las Vegas club, all of these hotels were far superior in every way polite and helpful staff, nice rooms and far cheaper than the Riviera. Also there were no resort fees and the safe was included. In total we spent 5 days out of 15 in the Riviera and out of them we ended up with a Mexican couple with a child in the next room to us from the 23/9/2011-26/9/2011,we had to suffer screaming and shouting up to 4am for 3 days and to add insult to injury in the morning they had a do not disturb notice on the door. The maid service was just about none existent a quick flick around, we had the same sheets on the bed for 10 days I know this because the top sheet had a rip in it and 3 holes on my side. The hoover was run over the room 3 times during our stay we checked the room most days. I could go on and on but to finish I will say we were booked to go back again in November for 16 days at the Riviera but we phoned up and got the travel agent to change our bookings to another hotel thank god, as for complaining to the management why keep complaining my advice to anyone considering staying at the Riviera don’t go elsewhere where you are treated with respect and politeness, even when we booked out all that was said was that’s you all paid up .no hope you enjoyed your stay and look forward to seeing you again. So go elsewhere don’t put up with rubbish treatment and bad service it’s your money and your holidayI've waited a while to write this review, as this hotel was such a bad experience, I was simply trying to block it out. I've stayed at more than thirty of the four stars in Manhattan by now, and I generally don't care for most of them - New York is a city where you seem to have to pay the dollars to stay at a five star or a boutique hotel to get an exceptional service and comfort experience, and if you are hardly in the room, it doesn't seem worth it. Still, there are plenty that give you a clean, functional room that allows a comfortable stay. I needed one extra night when I extended my stay for the US Open and the Marriott I was staying at the second week was booked, so I used priceline and was quite surprised when I was given this hotel which I mistakenly imagined was higher than the priceline four star bid level (based on W hotels in other cities). Well, from the moment i checked into the rude, horrifying desk, I was treated according to my priceline-station-in-life. The woman could not muster a smile or a welcome as she pushed the room key toward me. The room I was given was simply a disaster. First of all, there isn't anything special about these rooms. Cheap "trendy" furniture, and what is supposed to pass for a modern look, which is actually dated compared to the equivalent hotels elsewhere in the world. I wasn't concerned with the decor, however. My first and foremost concern is that many parts of this particular room had not been vacuumed in what must have been years. I'd lay in bed and look down below the side table, and never mind the whole candy wrapper, the nail clippings, and other filth, the thick layer of grey fuzz dust was astonishing. The edges of the desk, the shelves, but most appallingly, any area of the carpet that was not easily accessible to the vacuum was totally filthy. One large oily stain on the mattress sheet. Stains on the pillow cases. I have not experienced this in a four star, what is more a W. The bahtroom tiles cracked in more places than I could count. A big black dent in the tub. The toilet didn't flush, and I called downstairs. They fixed that. The toiletries were nice, and thats the only good thing I can recall. The lighting which is the mood lighting that perhaps appeals to a certain younger clientele (god knows why) was depressing, nonfunctional, and simply a joke. I've stayed at art-tech hotels around the world and maybe this place is trying to emulate those. They should not try. Get a lighting expert in, and fix the placement of the bulbs to garner the same effect, but in a functional way. I was too tired from the US Open to care to make a big fuss, but the next day upon checkout I asked for a receipt. I was refused a receipt showing a zero balance, because I had used priceline. Three rude women, one a manager, kept telling me I could not get a receipt. I've used the same service for maybe a hundred hotel stays and have always been able to get a printed hotel record of my stay. But no, these ladies could not be bothered. I got so tired of being ignored as they went about their business behind the desk, I even left for a few hours and asked that they figure it out upon my return to retrieve my bags The checkout was so horrifyingly inefficient, with one individual ATTEMPTING to handle all the bags people wanted to store for the day, and not managing at all - and piles of tourists standing around in the lobby cursing or complaining about the bad service. It took 35 minutes to hand a tiny bag to this man, who seemed angry the whole time he tried to take bags to storage. It took almost as long to retrieve it upon my return. The idiot desk-folk had still not figured out how to print a hotel receipt documenting my stay upon my return. This was the final straw and I asked to speak to a manager. I listed the problems in my room, and the state of filth in the room, as well as the checkout fiasco and all i got was "I assure you, we vacuum the rooms" with a blank stare. And this was the manager. Had I not been so tired from that weekend, and wiped out by moves between hotels and Flushing Meadows, I would have insisted on a room inspection. But every request at this hotel took so long, I would have missed my flight. The place was a zoo, and a poorly run zoo. Chaotic, noisy, unfriendly. Finally, and most irritatingly - a pet peeve of mine is when hotel staff treat guests differently, based clearly on what the assume their station in life is, all in the span of minutes. This is an idiotic asinine habit that you usually find in slightly higher end hotels (but not in the very best hotels), among poorly trained staff. You can find them lavishing one hotel guest with attention,respect, welcoming smiles....while not spending a second in attending to another moments later. I observe this from afar, and in this particular case, near - and find it appalling. These surface judgements of merit and worth have no place in the service industry, and any place that doesn't value all their customers equivalently deserves a zero rating. You can't judge a book by its cover. A person's clothing, luggage, sunglasses or nail manicure are not the basis for your hospitality. Learn what it means to provide service. This hotel was certainly one such place, all pretense and with no substance. I've never been treated so poorly, in visiting NYC six or more times annually. Train your staff. Clean your rooms. Meanwhile, I shall keep away and warn everyone I know not to stay at this particular W hotel.would not return My husband and I decided to take a last minute vacation and went to this resort due to the affordable price. We also went with a very open mind after reading some of the reviews. There were problems throughout our trip but we overlooked everything until the last 2 days when we were sick in bed. This is a long review as well, as I found that these to be very informative. We are late 20's, professional and have traveled in the Bahamas, Mexico and Alaska.This is a very European resort. We only came into contact with about 3 other American couples during our stay. We felt very isolated, which is our mistake because we were aware of this on booking. I have heard steriotypes of the rude Americans but I can honestly say that we demonstreated the most manners at this resort. The Europeans cut in line (we read this in another review), wear their bathings suits to breakfast, and are generally unfriendly. I can could on one hand the number of people that returned a smile or a hello. The beach is beautiful, lots of palm trees, great for walking. We walked about 8 miles a day. If you walk to the left a couple miles there is an area that has some sea shells. General: first there is absoutly no consistency in anything that is done here. On arrival drinks were handed out to some but not all (including ourselves). They provided no information on check in, only a key. You have to do your leg work here and find out everything on your own. We had to return twice to the front desk for a safe key and a map to find our way. They ask you to fill out a questionaire at the end of your stay but don't provide a pen. We had to walk to the desk to get it and they actually wanted us to return it. As for the resturants, many of the Europeans stay here for approx. 2 week intervals and take up all the reservations which forces most to eat at the buffet for every meal. We did get into one and the reatuarant was only half - full. We were wondering if maybe they make reservations just in case they want to eat there and never cancel. We even heard on of the hotels travel guides say to a guest checking in that this is the most unfair hotel he has ever seen. On night one, we asked for water at least 3 times before it arrived, while others were being served bottles of water, on night 2 we asked for a wine and were given a 2 brand new bottles of both red and white. On night 3 they sat us in the royal suites dinig area, we still don't know why. Bascially, you never know what to expect. Restaurants: I have to say for a buffet the food was good. Fish and pasta were very good. Breakfast was great. We only were able to eat at one a-la-carte, the Haceinda and was very good. Although all seatings are timed. You get one hour to eat. You order, appetezier, entree and desert at the sme time. This isn't the place to sit back and relax but the waiters are alot more friendly here. Entertainment: The shows were actually better than ones we have seen at other resorts. Much longer performances, which is nice since you are advised not to leave the resort at night. Bars: bartenders are very unfriendly, never saw a smile. In Mexico the bartenders knew your name after a couple days and what you liked to drink, so this was a surprise. My husband was given a glass with a chip on the bottom and cut his finger, he was bleeding at the bar, both of us trying unsuccessfully to get a napkin for a few mintues, (one bartender actually waved us away with his hand) had to go to the lobby where he was given a napkin and a piece of tape. Rooms: Outdated. We paid extra for a grand deluxe ocean view. No ocean view, mattress was terrible, the was a dead cricket on the bottom of the floor in the closet for at least 2 days that I saw and was there when we left. No fan in the bathroom, lots of mold. No locks on bathroom door. They had fruit in our room on arrival that didn't look too fresh when we checked in. It sat there all week, and was there when we checked out. (It had mold on that too). Tipping: Don't waste yout money. We tipped 5 US Dollars after every dinner, 2 or 3 after breakfast and 1 dollar after every other trip to the bar. Waste of money, they don't even act as if it is appreciated. Doesn't ensure better service at all. At 2 dinners we had the same waitress, we had left her a total of 10 dollars even after she cleared our table and sat another couple down while we went to get dessert. (my camera was still at the table). She introduced herself about 10 hours later at breakfast like it was the first time she ever laid eyes on us. (we stopped tipping). Tipping might help with the maids. We had heard about giving little gifts. Every morning we gave 2 dollars and barrets, make-up, coloring books, or pencils. She did leave us towels every day so we didn't have to wait in line to get them or check them back in. Half way through our vacation we started not feeling well with abdominal cramps. On our last night, (the night we got a reservation) we could barely get through dinner. (need I say more?) We were back in our room at 8pm and both in bed with chills, and sleeping by 8:30. We missed the show and the beach party. We were sick the entire next day that we had to travel home. You cannot drink the water here (they do supply an enourmous amount of bottled water). We can only guess that we were sick from the drinks served at the beach with ice in them. Overall, the beach and lanscaping are beautiful, food ok, but this is not a resaon to come here. The people and problems began to outweigh the positives. I am embarressed to tell people we even stayed here.I never met a fruitcake I didn't like, until now....CLAXTON FRUIT CAKE (3lb.) AMAZON REVIEW<br /><br />Credit cards are weird.  I mean, you wann 'em, and if you play your cards right over time, you gott 'em. But ahh, the catch.  If you don't use 'em, you might just lose 'em.  What's all of this have to do with fruitcake?  Well, sans any fruitcake jokes, please stand by...<br /><br />Recently, I've lost a couple of hard-earned credit cards, due to "lack of use."  Really?  I mean, really?!!  Is this what America has come down to?  I do all I can to establish or re-establish my basic U.S. dollar, human worthiness for unsolicited credit card offers, only to get a few, only to lose out when I don't use them for awhile?  Without warning.  ZAP!  They're gone.  Seems "they" want you to have the cards, but if you go overboard with them, they hound you to no end, but then, if you don't use them, or even forget you had one, they cut you off and cancel your card.  Fruitcake, I say!  Fruitcake!<br /><br />So it was, after I learned these things and more, that I told myself, with one card, hey, I better USE this or LOSE it.  Having nothing really I wanted or needed at the time (all you NEED is love...), I ordered this product from Amazon.  Through one of those cards I feared losing soon, unless I used it.  But after ordering, receiving, and trying this particular product (some supposed "gourmet" fruitcake), I can only report that this was/isss overall, much less than I expected.  In other words, this is pretty bad fruitcake, in my opinion, and for the price, really bad.  If you are at all in my situation, I strongly suggest that you use any under-used credit card funds or other "disposable income" on something else.  Cause this is pretty bad fruitcake.<br /><br />Now, before you cut me to the quick, and question either/or my knowledge and experience of/with said fruitcake product, let me just say that I've been getting fruitcakes as gifts (usually around Christmas), for a long, long, long, long time.  Ever since I care to remember actually.  I think I remember that once upon a time, I casually mentioned to family, friends, or others, that I liked fruitcake.  I actually, generally LIKED fruitcake.  Well, soon the word spread, and I've been given them by family, friends, or other over the ages.  Not that I'm complaining, because I DO LIKE FRUITCAKE!  There, I said it all.  But...this particular fruitcake brand?  Fairly average at best, but compared to the cost, pretty awful.<br /><br />Oh, believe me dear readers and followers, I WANTED to like this.  I really did.  An impulse buy at the time, all I wanted really was some half-decent fruitcake and an inexpensive means to keeping a credit card alive and kicking.  Well, big, impulsive mistake, because, according to my taste, and my own decades-long relationship with fruitcakes in general, this is not very good.  And it is only my history of loving almost EVERY fruitcake I've ever had, which guides to you, my fellow fruitcake lover, away from buying anything more than a sample of this product.  And please don't make the mistake I made when I ordered taste-unseen, three single fruitcakes, when the purchase of even one would've told me the story here.<br /><br />I realize with this review that I may go against the grain (though not fiber-wise) in dissing this, but I'm just coming from a long history of fruitcake enjoyment and this doesn't even come close in quality, taste, and otherwise, to fruitcakes enjoyed past, present, and future.  Heck, this isn't even "cake" at all.  It's like this big, thick, DOUGH, with TOO many TOO sweet "fruits," and the nuts were pretty dry and unmemorable.  Heck, I don't even LIKE sweets generally.  I'd much rather have a bowl of cheese crackers or chips than a bowl full of M&M's or Reese's peanut butter cups or chunkey monkey or any other such sickenly sweet thing.  But heck, just about the ONLY sweet I've ever really loved, was/is fruitcake.  So, why was/is this so disappointing, and so overpriced?<br /><br />I think this is the fruitcake equivalent of fruitcake DOUGH.  Like cookie-dough ice-cream, which I've always thought too weird and not really concentrating on the essentials.  This is like eating fruitcake DOUGH, before any baking.  And that, ain't good.  Fruitcake should be CAKE, not uncooked DOUGH.  And that's what this is really.  In the end, wholly unacceptable, and to go technical on you'all, pretty darn yucky, you betcha!  Only my opinion...try a sample before ordering anything more than that.<br /><br />Judging by the generally favorable opinions about this specific fruitcake I've found here on Amazon, I may never know if this is just me, or what.  This has generally high reviews, but I only managed to finish ONE of the THREE individual pounds I ordered and was sent (and btw, Amazon delivered nice and fast and easy as usual), and was just gonna GIVE the rest away, but I think I would've felt guilty about subjecting anyone else to this, so I just threw the other two pound "cakes" away.  Maybe the rats or worms will like it, I don't know.<br /><br />Basically, to make a long, boring, but hopefully humorous story short, I suggest buyer beware on this, and buy/try the smallest portion/size you can.  If you like this thick, tasteless in many ways, un-fruitcake, by all means, purchase away.  But I can't give this any kind of enthusiastic thumbs up, as far as fruitcakes go.  And wouldn't ya know it, the instructions for use are virtually non-existent, with no manual, no software, and little documentation as to why and how I'm supposed to actually enjoy this doughy mess.  And no real warranty!  Fruitcake lover/buyer beware...<br /><br />To all fellow outcast, strange dog, hopelessly romantic, secret fruitcake lovers, my small minority brothers and sisters who KNOW good fruitcake from bad, let me just say that this is nowhere near worth the asking price.  To those of you who've tried this and actually liked it, I can only suggest you expand your fruitcake worldview and experience to other brands because this just ain't that good.  A cheap dollar store variety is better than this, IMHO.  One thing for sure though, next hardly used credit card purchase goes to another gift card for someone else, for something other than such a bad product as bad as this...I am from Brazil, so forgive all spelling mistakes.... Me and my wife went to California to visit San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and other small towns. After staying in a lot of motels, we searched for a nice place. Our Guide Book didnÂ´t give us much options but recomended Cadillac because of its location. Whe got to Cadillac very late, after a long car trip. So, we just wanted to stay somewhere safe with a nice bed. When we got to the Cadillac, we though our GPS was wrong because all we could see were a lot of homeless in front of one building. We got really scared (first time we did not felt safe in USA) but since wwe didnt know about other places to stay and it was very late, we decided to give it a shot. Since it was saturday, they only had the simplest room avaiable (cant blame them for that). Even though, we had to pay 129,00 + tax per night. Well, scarred and without opitions, we decided to stay for one night and then look for another place. When we did our check in, we made very clear that we where propably staying only for one night. Right after we finished our check in, and before we go to the room, we asked if it was safe to leave some things in the car. Since the parking lot is payed, and expensive, i assumed they would be respossable for safety. The lady from the hotel told me that i had to take everything out of the car, because it was not safe and they dont assume responsability for anything that happens to the car and its contents. Worried, I asked her 1 minute and went to a public phone, in front of the hotel, and called for another hotel placed in Santa Monica. The Hotel in Santa Monica was classified as very good but expensive, the reason why i did not look for it before. I decided to expend more, but to feel safe, and decided to call just to see if they had vacancy. I found out that the hotel had rooms for 99 + tax per night. Very happy to have an alternative, i went back to the Cadillac Hotel and asked to cancel my check in, since i did not entered the room yet. Then I was told that if i cancelled it i would have to pay for that night and for the parking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Very pissed off I decided to stay for that night. The room was very small but looked clean. So we started taking out of the car all luggage we had, felling unsafe, because the parking is on the back off the building, where there is almost no light and some homeless. After taking a shower in that ridiculous small shower box, we layed to sleep (about 1 am). After some minutes my wife started to scream, saying that shell felt something in her leg. We found a medium cocorach walking over the sheets. I call the front desk and asked to change room or to change sheets. The front desk lady said we couldnt change room because we had already "used" the on we were in and she also said that she had no other sheets avaiable for queen bad. I asked for changing sheets with any room and she said it was not alouded, because someone else could check in that night. Really pissed off, but tired as hell, we made a huge search in the room for another bugs, and we did found another cocoroach (smaller) under the bed. I called again front desk and complained again. I was told that cocoroachs have wings and they can come in anytime by the windows, so the hotel have is not responsible for that. What a joke! Ok.... on the next morning i asked to check out really soon (7:30 am). I was told that my check in was for 3 nights and, if i checked out early, i would have to pay U$ 75 fee. Actually, that was writen on the check in paper that I had signed, but I told the lady, on the check in, that i was checking for only one night, that i would propably change hotel, and she said that i would be charged, if i decided to do so. Felling robbed, i decided not to fight anymore against the hotel, and said i would stay one more night only, since i was not going to lose U$ 75 for nothing. Tha same day I got back to the hotel and informed, again, that i wass leaving on the next day. That night we did not found bugs on the room, but the noise from the homeless in front of the hotel made very difficult to sleep nice. On the next morning, again, I asked for check out and again I was told that there would be a U$ 75 fee, since I have to ask for early check out 48hs in advanced. The thing is.... since it was my second day on that hotel, is was impossible to ask for early check out. because I needed to know it even before I check in.... it is crazy. Incredulous that I was having this kind of treatment in the US, I asked to talk to the manager, but It was denied because the manager was at home with his family and the hotel was not autorized to call at his home for "minor" issues. I was told to call on the next day. I said I was staying one more day and had to talk with manager to check out withpout paying that fee. The front desk men just said: I am sorry, but there is nothing I can do for you. Conclusion. For the first time in my hole life I felt robbed, cheatted. In the last 6 years I have gone to a lot of coutrys, like Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay... and a lot of big cities, like Nova York, Londres, Paris, and I never felt so unsafe and so robbed like this time. So here is my review: - I was cheated by the front desk over and over - The Hotel is very expensive - Rooms are quite small and, though they look clean, we found cocoroachs on it (one in the bed). Staff did not autorized us to change room, neither changed the sheets. - The bath box is ridicously small - The hotel charges a lot for parking but gives no security - The manage isnÂ´t there... he likes to stay with his family why guests have cocoroach problems. After so many problems he should at least have called us. - The only thing that should be good is itÂ´s localization, since it is near the beach. Though, it is not good. There are homeless (a lot) walking around the hotel all the time, so it becomes really unsafe to get out of the hotel after it is dark. - I just felt happy when i check out, even being robbed and having to pay an absurd fee. My sugestion: DONT GO. Stay anywhere else even if you have to pay more for that. I have already contacted my Guide Book publisher and made a formal complainI stayed here for two weeks and base my review on the aggregate visit and observations of both properties. First, know that there are two locations for Vantaggio Suites in San Diego: the State Street property, which is like a very run down and poorly managed combination of youth hostel and frat house, and the Broadway Street property, which is comprised of several individually-owned units thrown into the Vantaggio Suites rental pool. It seemed like a poor rendition of a time-share situation; however, there was no effective management or oversight to speak of and there would certainly not be any takers were this a "real" time share property. Pros: State Street property is right on the edge of Little Italy in downtown San Diego, directly across the street from Amici Park. There is easy I-5 freeway access, and plenty of Italian restaurants and shops easily within walking distance of less than a block. And with a short walk toward the San Diego bay, this place has got location, location, location (but no parking!). There are common areas like you would find in a frat house as well as a laundry room. It is a highly international clientele, with Japanese advertisements and postings all over the place. Broadway Avenue property is further east from San Diego, located on Broadway between 26th and 27th Streets past the East Village area. It's a fairly residential area but is quite unsafe in the evenings. There are bars on the windows and a gated entrance and gated garage (which is included in the room price). The area is very Hispanic, and there are a few Mexican restaurants within walking distance (but I'd recommend only do this during daylight hours). There's a fire station within a block, so expect to hear lots of sirens. Rooms come with balconies and kitchen facilities, complete with full-sized fridge, microwave, dishwasher, stove. There is unlimited wired internet access. There is a small TV, about the size of a 17" computer flat screen. Cons: First let me say that I am jaded about this place and would absolutely NOT recommend it to anyone. This is due to the fact that I had two "accidents" on the property and sustained injuries and bruises, and I gave up trying to assign responsibility for the poor condition of not only the elevator but the emergency and stairwell access. The elevator broke, with me in it, and dropped a floor very quickly. I was thrown to the floor injuring my back and left side/hip/leg. To add insult to injury, neither the alarm nor the doors worked so I was trapped inside. Calls to the management office were futile and they declined knowledge or responsibility to the property, so I called 911. The firemen had me out in about 20 minutes; however, they could not find the stairs (because the stairs were unmarked, and they are also inaccessible from outside the stairwell meaning that you can get out but you can't get in). We had to walk completely around the block (on my injured hip and leg and back, no less) in order to get into the complex. Anyway, to make a horrible story shorter, Vantaggio Suites management and employees, NNJaescke Property Management and employees, and the owner of the actual unit all pointed to each other and the State of California for responsibility for the malfunctioning elevator and my injuries. By the end of my stay there, I felt like it was my own fault. Other cons for Vantaggio Suites at Broadway: - Filthy dirty. Old, ragged carpet that was not only frayed but was a trip hazard. - Old dirty curtains. When you pulled the fabric curtains opened, you held your breath that the curtain rod would not collapse, and you literally had to unstick your hand from the dirty fabric. - Damaged screens with holes. Place was so dirty that there were spider webs (inside!) and bugs flying in and out. With no air circulation, no fan, and no air conditioning, and weather in the 100 degree range, I had no choice but to leave the windows opened. - Murphy bed. It was down when I arrived, which was a good thing because I could not get it to raise or go back into the wall. - Stinks! This place smells like old garbage. Though it is getting a facelift, repainting, and fixing the front courtyard area, it is still a very old building that resembles a converted flop house or homeless shelter. - Dishes and utensils provided were well used and dirty. Though there was a dishwasher, apparently the previous occupant had not used it and nobody checked (or they checked but did not care). Dishes were past spotty ... they had grime on them. I promptly threw every dish and pan I could find into the dishwasher and ran them myself. - Plastic utensils (spoon, spatula) they had provided were melted in half and unusable, so I took them to the front desk where they promptly laughed me out of the office. I ended up purchasing my own set and taking them with me. - Combo tub and shower were in a decent sized bathroom area. However, it was a very old metal tub (read: slippery). Because of a fall, I ended up purchasing my own bath mat. - Old construction! This means that the walls are thin, and the permanent apartment residents do have their own TVs and stereos that echo around the complex. It's shaped in a square with the courtyard in the middle, so the noise bounces inside the place. Also, the couple on the 4th floor (the top floor) had hardwood floors and sounded like the walked everywhere with tap shoes on. - Remember that this operates much like a time share, so you do not have cleaning service. If you desire, they can schedule once per week refreshment/upkeep cleaning, for $150 per month. I would have run screaming in another direction within 10 minutes of arriving there and gone to another property if given the choice. However, the entire stay would have been non-refundable. When I voiced my concerns to the management at the front desk, the response was "you can leave whenever you want, but there's no way we're giving you back any money." You have been warned ... I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!Since we go to WDW every December we decided to go the Grand Floridian this December for our 40th anniversary. We booked the honeymoon room which is located on second floor of Main Building. I've heard many negatives reports but thought sour grapes. So off we went Dec 4th. Got at the resort at 9:30am & was taken up to 3rd floor to check in. The person was very nice & said he would have room ready as soon as previous guests checked out at 11am. So we went over to MK, had lunch, rode some rides. Then we called at 1:30pm and he said it was ready. We headed back over & no room. He said he would see when next room would be ready. He came back & said 15 minutes just relax & have something to drink. So far okay. After an hour no room. Another person asked if we needed anything, we said we were waiting for our room. He checked & said one was ready. The concierge manager took us to our room. He asked if there was a special event that brought us to the GF we said yes & told him. After relaxing we went to the Christmas Party & came back around 9pm to find a platter of chocolate covered strawberries which I ordered for Monday so I thought they made a mistake. That night the noise level was way too loud but we over looked it. I mentioned to the person I ordered the strawberries that they brought it to us a day early & to cancel that night's she said she would call. (We saw the manager who asked if we liked the strawberries he gave us on the house? I said yes but he should have put that in the note.) That night more strawberries. Ok, she did say she would take them off bill. Ha! That night noise was louder than before called down to front desk since it was after 10pm & said they would check into it. It got worse between midnight until 4:30am, sounded like they were doing work on the building. Also TV didn't work, hair dryer didn't work. While hubby was getting ready the next day, I walked down to talk to another concierge, told him about the noise & other problems, please note there was other people complaing about contruction noises during early morning. He said he would look into it & he said he would give me a credit of half that night room rate we paid $615 plus taxes. I said I wasn't looking for that but wanted something done about the noise & other problems. He said he wanted to give some of it back. Nice touch so I thought. Later that night, more noise so I went down & talked to yet another person who came back to room & he said he didn't know what the noise was but he had another room on same floor. Okay so we changed hoping for the best & all the problems would go away. After having some dinner we came back to room, hubby said no working TV even though we tried it before we left for dinner. When trying to use toilet it didn't flush. Plus hair dryer didn't work. So we called down & reported this. He had a man up to check out toilet, he said it needed to be replaced all together, try not to use toilet paper & flush twice but to make sure it didn't over throw. This is not funny. He did replace the TV & said he would replace hair dryer the next day along with a new toilet. Andy called & said he heard what was going on & asked if we could be out of our room by 9am the next day, said yes, he said he was sorry but this too can be fixed.Oh postive side no noise. Next day, we stopped by desk to remind them about putting in new toilet & hair dryer. The guy even called while we were still there. So we thought all was okay finally. Came back around 2pm & no toilet replaced or hair dryer. And toilet didn't even work. We walked back to the desk and said what was going on? The lady was shocked that they didn't do the work. I reminded her we wasted about a total of a day with working out these problems which shouldn't have happen in the so call cream of the top resort in WDW. She called the maintaince manager who came up to our room & told us he just got yelled at by his boss & now it was our turn to yell at him. I just looked at him & said I wasn't going to yell but wanted to know why after there was a work order to do these things. (A good thing we came back as we were going to stay at MK for late closing if we did that no toilet.) He said he would replaced it & he didn't know why it wasn't. He had the two guys that was suppose to do come up. He asked them why didn't they follow instructions on a work order. All they could say we thought they would save the resort some money. I looked at them & asked if they would like to pay me what I paid for a room that didn't have a working toilet for a day & half? They said no they wouldn't like that. The manager told me it would be replaced & he would stay to make sure. After 4pm it was ready & working. We had dinner & went back to MK though we were rather in a grumpy mood over how we were being treated. To make a story short, when we checked out on Saturday morning, we wasn't given a credit even though I had the paper work. I checked over the bill & saw that they charged us for two orders of strawberries. I said I wasn't paying for something the staff gave us. He said he would take both off & give us the credit that wasn't on checkout bill even though it was in the computer. He said he was sorry that knew we had a bad week there & hoped we would give them another chance. I didn't say anything but Andy was there & knew I wouldn't come back next year with our son & his wife. We lefted saying thank goodness that is over with & hubby said he was sorry that he didn't listen to me about how much it was costing after he complained about our trip to the USVI being too much like only $2500 beachfront at the Morningstar at Frenchmen's reef. We paid over $5400 for 6 nights at the GF. A sour taste was left in my mouth Sunday when I checked my Disney Visa online & saw a $300 room charge. I called back down & talked to a front desk manager who looked it up & saw what was wrong, when they gave us a credit they didn't punch in a code therefore a charge instead of credit so I was charged twice even tough my paper work said a credit due me. He said he work take care of it & call me back. He did but said the department that handles it was closed on Sunday, he would do it first thing Monday & call me back before he left at 3pm today. No call back & when I called, he left at 1:45pm. I asked the person to have him looked into the matter that he & I talked about Sunday & call me back on Tuesday. She said she would leave a note. I think I will have better luck with Disney Visa but they said to try to work it out before I put in a dispute. Now I know some of you all loved the place, I didn't I went with open eyes & wasn't expecting so many problems, yes they tried to fix them but a little too late. I will never stay there again no matter what. I will say it is a lovely resort but they need to tend to rooms & the way they handle problems. These are my views so you might want to say thing about my report. Do so but you wasn't in our shoes and we know what we experienced.Probably my worst dining experience in new york, and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about.Stayed at this hotel from June 30th & checked out July 3rd(thank god!!). Had I known then what I know now, I never would have stayed there. Family of 5(myself, husband, 15 yr. old, 4 yr. old & 1 yr. old). I personally didn't have any issues with checking in. But the problems started immediately after that!!!! Went to room(8th floor) & almost got smashed with the elevator doors that shut after 3 seconds! Actually lost my 4 yr. old in elevator as she went up to the 16th floor & I am left standing there helpless. The doors shut before the rest of us were able to get in with our luggage. Great start, right?? It gets worse...Get to room & flip light switch & no light working at door.(Have to turn on bathroom light). Send in my 15 yr. old to turn on lamp while I hold open door so she can see & lamp light is also not working. Finally find a lamp with a working light. Call front desk to replace 2 lightbulbs. Next, the room smells so bad(like a dead animal or worse...just smelled so absolutely rotten & it was NOT a smoking room). Once we took our shoes off, figured out the carpet was soaked in spots & socks came up black from walking around. Yuck!! We end up cranking up the air conditioner & opening up our balcony door just to get fresh air circulating in there. Next, hubby makes coffee & when he goes to pour it, it makes a huge mess as he notices the coffee pot is broken pretty badly on the pour spout.(Another call to the front desk & they replace the pot). Ok, that's the first day! 2nd day, get up, take showers to find out hair dryer doesn't work & I have hair down to my butt, so you can only imagine(another call to the front desk..unreal! they must be lovin' me at this point)...man comes up & has to take dryer off the wall & says he needs to take it to the repair shop & replaces with one that works. Today, my husband who is 6'4 notices a plate of food on top of the tall beureau that holds the TV. When he gets it from the back, it is a moldy plate of fruit(probably someone's previous room service)..Nonetheless, we figured out where part of the smell was coming from. Also, most of the cleaning crew don't speak English(not a horrible thing UNTIL you need something from them & they look at you like you are crazy, especially when you are handing them a plate of moldy fruit)!!!!!! Ok, next day, since we had a Family Plan w/ our hotel room, we go to dinner at restaurant which is included. When we get to restaurant, they ask if we want the buffet. We say Sure! They send us to another room where they have the buffet, which we are promptly told it is an additional 6 bucks per person & that it doesn't include drinks, so we decide not to do buffet & go back to the restaurant where not only do we not pay anything extra, we get served, unlike what would happen at the buffet. Very rude front desk girl at restaurant(she seemed altogether unhappy to see us back)..I said we decided not to get the buffet & I swear it was like she was shocked. Anyway, we end up getting seated & this restaurant,especially the tables are not clean, sugar everywhere, dirty glasses, coffee cups & silverware. We told them at front before we got seated that we needed a high chair for the 1 yr. old(duh!!!). When we are seated, our server comes & we had already been there for 2 minutes & still NO highchair. We ask her for a highchair, she says she'll be right back. Comes back & says, all highchairs were taken to buffet room, so I said, "Can someone bring us a highchair from that room??" The girl at the front was also there & says she will see what she can do to get us a highchair. I watched her from the table & she made no attempt whatsoever to get us a highchair. She made no phonecall though at the buffet there were so many workers there, that someone could have brought us a stinkin' highchair. I chalk it up to this woman's rudeness of being someone who apparently doesn't like her job foremost & 2ndly doesn't like families with small children. Server trying to be nice & making excuses for rude woman at front, ends up talking us into a booster seat in which I told her we would need to change tables for a table that had chairs with sides to it so that she wouldn't fall off the side of the chair onto the floor in the booster seat. We changed tables though it seemed like the end of the earth was coming because I asked to do this. It seemed once we were settled, all was good from there. Server very accomodating. Food very good! Then back to the unbearably obnoxiously smelly room. Also, on this particular day, it took housekeeping til 3pm to clean our room. That is just unacceptable. I called to front desk to ask why it seemed like they skipped our room & they told me that they had til' 5pm to clean our room. Indoor pool area nice. Convenient to get to the beach. Ample parking area. We did not visit outdoor bar or indoor bar & did not visit outdoor pool(too busy seeing sites to be worried with all that). Staff at front door of hotel pleasant. People getting room service putting their trays of dirty plates & glasses in the hallway were not getting picked up all day as we came in & out of hotel. Just gross!!!~~~ Checkout was fine. After all this, WE WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN, especially after making us feel bad for wanting to eat in their restaurant(which was included in Family Plan) & heaven forbid, you ask for a highchair!!! If you expect they are prepared for families, you will be highly mistaken & extremely disappointed. I did not like the way I was treated there at all. The blatant grossness of the smelly room which I'm sure had to be hazardous & obviousness that the cleaning crew are doing the bare minimun after finding that moldy plate of food. We had stayed at Comfort Inn in the past & have never had anything less than clean facilities & wonderful service & that is where we will stay from now on. Feel free to let me know your experience, whether you went with family or not doesn't matter. I'd love to hear from you!!!!!!!!~~~~~During my stay at the Tuscany, from 19-30 August, the following problems were encountered: * When I made my reservation, I informed Tuscany that my sister would be joining me for my trip in a nanny capacity, to watch the children, since the purpose of my trip was for government business. My reservation was for two adults and two toddlers. I also informed the Tuscany of the number of occupants in the room when I checked in, because my sister was arriving later than me and was going to be checking in separately. o When I checked into the room, I had to request extra towels, because there were not enough towels for the room occupants. o Each day, after housekeeping serviced the room (with inadequate cleaning), we had to call the front desk to request more towels. Consistently, each day, there were not enough towels for the room occupants. o When more towels were delivered, often the gentleman would wait awkwardly for a tip. Since I consider this a basic service of the room, not an added luxury or special request, I found this to be rude. * When I checked in, I requested two cribs. The cribs were initially delivered and set-up with sheets very promptly and the sheets were put on the foam mattress so the children could sleep on the sheets. After the first day, housekeeping would strip the crib foam mattress and would not replace the sheets. This would cause us to call the front desk to request sheets for the crib each time that housekeeping visited the room and cleaned, inadequately. o When the sheets were brought to the room, I had to insist that the staff put them on the crib. This should be standard practice. Again, the staff waited for a tip. * On Wednesday the 22nd, I went to dinner at Marilyn’s Café. The meal was good; however, when I tried to pay, the server was not able to charge my card. He informed me that I needed to pay at the front of the restaurant because his machine was down. I waited at the front of the restaurant for 30 minutes trying to pay for my meal because the staff was unable to get the machines working and didn’t start charging the meals to the room for almost half an hour. This was unacceptable. The restaurant should be prepared for simple things like credit card machine malfunctions. * I checked in on Sunday the 19th and my room was not vacuumed until the following Sunday, the 26th. o I complained to the housekeeper in building C on Friday the 23th, and the room was not vacuumed. o I complained again to the housekeeper in building C on the morning of the 24th and informed her that we would be gone until the evening and requested that the room be vacuumed. When we returned at 10pm that evening; the room had not been vacuumed. o I immediately complained to Vic at the front desk. I also informed Vic about my dissatisfaction with Marilyn’s Café and about my further dissatisfaction with housekeeping for the towels and sheets. Vic gave me a $40 comp to return to Marilyn’s and requested that I wait until the next morning to have to room vacuumed. Vic was concerned about the late hour and disturbing other guests with the noise from the vacuum. I understood his concern and agreed. Vic put in a notice to housekeeping to have the room vacuumed first thing on Sunday morning. (Vic’s customer service was the best in the hotel.) o At about noon on Sunday, I informed the housekeeper in building C that I would be taking the boys to the pool and would return in approximately 2 hours. I requested that she vacuum the room while I was gone. When I returned at 2:45 pm, my room had not been vacuumed. My sister complained to Tara in the Concierge office and Tara informed her that there was nothing she could do except try to get housekeeping to vacuum. At this time, I joined my sister in Tara’s office, with the boys in a stroller. When I initially attempted to talk to Tara, she rolled her eye at me as if I were just another customer trying to get a discount by complaining. Each time I tried to explain my concerns to Tara, she interrupted me. I found it extremely rude that she continued to interrupt me and both of our voices elevated during the discussion. She stated that if I didn’t lower my voice she would call security because customers could hear us in the lobby. I told her it wasn’t my intent to yell, but that I didn’t care about the customer service for the other guests anymore, because the hotel hadn’t showed any customer service for me yet. As Tara called security, she stated, “What kind of parent would bring her child down here to complain? What kind of parenting skills are you teaching your child?” I found this comment to be a personal attack on me and extremely inappropriate. My husband is currently serving on active duty in the Army and is deployed. My son stays with me, even when I travel, because I try to be the best Mom that I can be. Her comment was completely offensive to me. No manager, in any profession, should personally attack a customer or question their parenting skills as an easy way to abort a conflict. * Before I arrived at the Tuscany, I coordinate to have a package shipped to meet me at the hotel. I called ahead to the front desk before I departed for Las Vegas and the front desk said that it would not be a problem to receive and hold a package for a guest. When I checked in, I was told that the bell desk receives and holds all packages. I informed the bell desk of the pending arrival of my package and continued to call each day until my package arrived on Tuesday the 21st. On Saturday the 25th, I finally received the message that my package had arrived. When I returned from my day trip that day, the message light on the phone was blinking and when I called to get instructions on checking the voice mail, I was informed of the message for the package. Now, this incident was relatively harmless, because I was diligent about tracking my package. However, this is not a timely or functional service for guests!We spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left.I called this hotel's reservations center directly and made one reservation for two adults. One confirmation was submitted to my email address; and after finding a different hotel I preferred to stay at during my visit to Orlando, I canceled my reservation through the link attached to the inital confirmation in the appropriate time I was given to avoid any charges being made to my credit card; and I was issued an cancellation number. While driving on the Florida turnpike (from Michigan) the day following the arrival date I was initally supposed to have checked in, a female from this hotel called my cell phone inquiring if I was still arriving at their hotel (sounded pretty desperate to me for business). I informed the individual that I had canceled the reservation and had a cancellation number in my email account and I was driving on the highway and that I needed to remain focused since traffic was somewhat congested. Nevertheless, she goes on to inform me that they (the hotel) didn't have a cancellation for me. I once again informed her that she was calling my cell phone while I was driving on the highway; and she goes on to inquire if I could forward the cancellation to her email address. DUH? What part of I am driving on the highway didn't she understand? I then informed her that when I arrived to where I was going, I would print the cancellation and bring it to her. She then goes on to ask me if I were in the Orlando area? DUH AGAIN! How many times had I informed her that I was driving on the highway enroute to this area? Anyways, when I arrived to the beautiful resort I elected to stay in, I was extremely exhausted being that I was the only driver in my vehicle; so, I checked in, showered and went to sleep. The following day, I had a strict schedule to adhere to and was not able to take the canceled reservation to this hotel; so, I wait until the next day, open my email and OMG, I have an email from this hotel asking me to submit to a survey for a one night stay. Huh? Immediately, I decided to check my bank account and discovered this hotel had charged me for a one night stay subsequent to me informing their representative that I had canceled the reservation; so, here comes the good part. When I arrive at the hotel with my canceled reservation, I am told that I made two reservations? Huh? Whoever I initially spoke to when making the reservation obviously has a hearing problem because I informed the reservation agent that I was making one (1) reservation for two (2) adults. Why did she list on my reservation I had a party of four (4) adults? Then, the front desk tells me that I made the reservation online. I told the woman that I did not make the reservation online, I called directly into the hotel because had I made the reservation online, I would have made it through my Gold Points account and this reservation was not in my Gold Points account; and that she could open my account to verify it. Then, she tells me that I made two reservations under the same confirmation number. If this were true, then, when I canceled the one reservation, the other reservation should have canceled also. Hmm, this seems correct to me. Okay, I was seeing how desperate they were in thinking I was going to yield to allowing them to keep money from my account that they had already fraudulently charged me for; so, I stood my grounds with informing them that I did NOT make two reservations; and they stood there toying with their system until I pulled out my cell phone and called my bank in their presence. All of sudden, the IGNORANT front desk manager tells the billing representative to refund my money because they didn't want to continue dealing with the issue. This raised a concern with both me and the representative from my bank (who heard her) and I reported the matter to the FRAUD department at my bank because it was very obvious that this hotel doubles the reservation on people who cancels their reservation as a measure of charging the customer for at least one night when the customer decides not to stay at their hotel. They stood in my face and told so many LIES, it was both pathetic and unprofessional. Had I made the reservation online, why would I list my name as Mrs. when that is not my appropriate title? Why wouldn't the reservation be listed in my Gold Points account? Why would I make a reservation for four adults when I was only traveling with my daughter? Why wouldn't I choose the AAA rate opposed to their best available rate (which is always higher)? BE CAREFUL WHEN MAKING RESERVATIONS DIRECTLY WITH THIS HOTEL BECAUSE IF YOU CHOOSE TO CANCEL, TEN TIMES OUT OF TEN, YOU'RE GOING TO BE PENALIZED FOR DECIDING NOT TO STAY AT THEIR HOTEL WHEN THERE ARE OTHER HOTELS THAT ARE MORE QUALITATIVE THAN THEIRS! I'm sure the majority of all of these GOOD REVIEWS are made by hotel employees. Nothing is perfect; and I have come to discover that this hotel actually is pitiful! I would suggest to anyone to sustain your cancellation number because if you don't, it is their word against yours and ten times out of ten, you will not get your money back. Now, this is a primary example of how businesses seek to take advantage of consumers in these extreme economic times. How pathetic! I wouldn't suggest this hotel to no one, even if they paid me to do it! UNPROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES EQUATE TO UNPROFESSIONAL BUSINESS...ATTEMPTED RIP OFF!When it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time, walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted...excuse me but isn't that his job???My fiancée and I both love London. It’s versatility, it's thriving night-life, it's enormous shops, it's tranquil parks and much more... It must be Europe’s grandest city. For the final two night of our travel through all of the UK, eventually leading to London, we decided to stay in a somewhat more luxurious hotel than the previous hotel/motels we stayed in. We were exhausted and we needed a good place to rest, located somewhere from were could easily explore the city. Choosing for the Central Park Hotel (which is supposedly of 3 star quality) was one of the WORST decisions we made throughout our many travels. As we came in, there was a giant queue in front of us, we needed to wait for more than 30 minutes before being told that we couldn’t check in any time before three o’clock. After three o’clock, my fiancée and I went to visit the Hyde Park in the meanwhile, a chubby lady who seemed to be inseparably surrounded by a strikingly strong odour of sweat and being relentlessly sulky towards us, said she wasn’t yet capable to check us in for a twofold reason: there was no room available, there was no booking made (?!?). After I showed her my conformation and her inquiring at the reservation office, it took another 30 minutes for her to return, she admitted that it was simply not posted correctly in the system she worked from. So we where finally checked in. She said breakfast wasn’t included in the rate, but after I showed her my conformation again, she annoyingly admitted it was. We got four, clearly already used, vouchers. The roomed that was given to us was remarkably tiny, imagine a cramp single room with a king-size bed in there, that’s how it seemed. It was clearly smaller than the rooms of cheaper hotels we stayed in during our may travels. After noticing the dust on our in our windowsill and the stains in our bath we went down again to kindly ask for another room. The lady, still the same one and the only one apparently on service, who seemed annoyed while ending her Internet chat sessions to answer my request, simply said that there were no other rooms available. If we would come back in the morning, she said literally: “Maybe one of my colleagues the other morning wants to change it for you, check it with them.” I informed her, which is true and not just a lie that suits the situation, about my fiancée’s asthma, and that my fiancée couldn’t stay in a room as dirty as the one we were allocated in, she simply replied, “That’s your problem, sir.” The other morning though, after not-enjoying the cheap breakfast (only spongy croissant with some jam, no, jelly with a colour, we asked again, and still the receptionists weren’t able, some maybe not even capable, of changing our room. My fiancée didn’t sleep all night because of her condition, but I didn’t feel it was appropriate using this in the argument, until everything resulted in me speaking to an uncaring, uninterested, bad tempered front-office manager. Still nothing happened. My fiancée brought two towels from home. We were planning to sleep in hotels, but you never know for sure whatever your come across (like what happened in the CPH). After we asked for two new towels, the original ones had suspicious stains on them, we were presented with two greasy new ones. My fiancée therefore decided to use one of her own. In the morning, after coming back disappointed from asking (applying seems a better fit term) for a new room, we found that our towels had been removed by housekeeping that was already cleaning everything. After calling reception, where they put us through to concierge, where they asked us to call housekeeping, where I was put on hold before being put through to a lady, we were explained that the towels had already been taken downstairs by mistake. In the evening after seven, we noticed they weren’t delivered back, so I informed at the concierge desk. They didn’t know, they asked the duty manager, a kind gentleman from India, who would ask housekeeping again. The next morning even after check-out they didn’t find anything, they would just take another look which raised the suspicion the didn’t look at all. We left without them, leaving our address at the concierge desk, but nothing was sent home. It is not about losing the towels, we might have thrown them away in the end anyway, but it’s about the hotel fetching guest’s possessions and not even taking an effort to return them to there righteous owners! The hotel is horribly dirty and cheap for a ridiculous high rate. This, on itself, would not even be all to bad if it wasn’t for all staff being incredibly incapable and insolent (including management, especially the front-office manager) in there approach towards guests. DON’T GO THERE!!Finally let into the store 5 at a time, to buy expensive slices from a harried staff.Fleeing a hurricane, we made a last minute reservation based on this hotel being rated #1 on Tripadvisor. I read all the other reviews which gave me high expectations but this hotel didnâ€™t even come close. The original reservation was for two nights but we ended up staying eight nights until we could go home. Had we known it would be such a long stay we would have checked out much earlier to find a better hotel. Here are the pros: 1. The beds and pillows are comfortable 2. There is a kitchen in every room 3. The director of sales is really helpful and friendly The cons: 1. The A/C compressor makes an awful rattling/buzzing noise every time it runs. Asked to have it looked at three times, no change. Not even a single apology from staff. 2. The refrigerator compressor is very loud, too. 3. Parking is off-site on a wide open surface lot. Walk out the front doors, around the corner, and down and across the street. If you come back at night and that lot is full, the front desk will tell you there's another lot "over there someplace" but can't give any more specifics. If you come and go during the weekdays the lot is overflowing with cars double and triple parked. You have to leave your keys with an attendant and then go back to retrieve your keys from him at 6pm. (We left our car parked and walked or took public transportation most of the time so we didn't have to turn our keys over.) 4. The closest decent restaurants are four or five blocks away. Not a big deal because the walk is well lit and seemed relatively secure. 5. The front desk staff is not friendly and doesnâ€™t care very much about the guests. If there wasnâ€™t another guest in front of me then I always felt like I was disturbing them from surfing the internet or playing computer games or whatever they were doing so intently on their screens. 6. The first time we extended our stay (I think after the first night) the agent assured me that it was taken care of and our keys would work. The next morning the housekeeper asked what time weâ€™d be checking out. I stopped at the front desk and, naturally, the stay hadnâ€™t been extended and the staff was terribly inconvenienced by me. 7. The second time I extended the stay (Iâ€™m a glutton for punishment by this point) the agent said there was a note on her computer saying not to extend the reservation. She couldnâ€™t figure out why the note was there, verified space was available, and extended it. 8. Breakfast was disappointing every day. We tended to go down later in the morning so Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s any better early on. They were always out of something, whether it was plates, bowls, fresh fruit, utensils, cerealâ€¦ always something missing. Iâ€™m no expert but I bet the health department would have an issue with the temperatures maintained on the hot and cold items. Thank God for the waffle maker, we used it every day! Oh, I almost forgot the fruit flies flying around the inside of the bread box. Ick. 9. The pool and hot tub temperatures are both very good but the chemicals are not properly balanced. I sat in the hot tub for a few minutes before the fumes burned my eyes too bad and I had to get out. The pool water changed my swim trunks to a new color. 10. The A/C in the lobby broke down at one point during our stay, they posted signs to let guests know. No big deal, I completely understand that those things happen. However, I think they turn the A/C off in all the public areas and the corridors during the evening hours and weekends when fewer people are around. I guess theyâ€™re trying to save a few dollars but itâ€™s a huge turn-off for anyone in the lobby, business center, gym, etc. 11. Both towel racks in our bathroom were about to fall off the wall. How could somebody not notice something so obvious and fix it? 12. Nobody (except the awesome director of sales) says â€œhelloâ€� or â€œgood morningâ€� or anything else. Even the GM doesnâ€™t seem to like to talk to guests. Out of four times passing by him he only made verbal contact once. Lame. 13. We stopped by the evening reception every time it happened but always ended up leaving to find dinner on our own. The white wine is room temperature and the red wine is empty. The individually wrapped crackers are somehow stale. The evening food has the same temperature and quantity issues as the breakfast. I donâ€™t know why it was such a bad experience. Maybe the stars aligned to make it so. If there had just been one or two problems I would be writing a very different review right now. Find someplace else to stay in the Big Easyâ€¦ there are many other options!I’m writing to warn everyone who is considering stay in this hotel. I wanted people to know what happened to me and hopefully you will understand it's not worth to take the risks. This hotel totally ruined my vacation and I will always remember this horrible experience. Safety is the most important thing while traveling in NYC and this place is DANGEROUS. Crime happens in this hotel everyday! I seriously think the hotel should be closed down by the government and I truly don't know why they are still in business. My husband, my sister and I arrived at Hotel Carter on 09/15/05. It took us 2.5 hours to check-in. (They don’t have a computer. Every thing is memorized in hotel stuff’s head or written by hand. Unfortunately, the hotel stuffs are not very organized, they messed up people’s reservation and they don’t seem care or feel sorry.) While we were waiting, we saw so many unbeliveable things happened... 2 girls who had left their luggages in the hotel's storage room but the bags are gone when they came back. (Note: The hotel charge $2-3 per bag but they are taking responsibilities for your stuff.) Two polices came and found out a guy who works in the hotel stole the bags and dump the empty bags in a big trash car. The hotel manager seems known that but he protent he didn't know. At the same time, there were 15-20 people complaining to the hotel’s manager about no water in their room and some said their TV/air condition are not working (PS. it was 90 degree and humid in NYC.) Hotel manager told everyone they are aware of the problem and are fixing it. By the afternoon, water will be available at every room. Even people are not happy but they accept the fact that they are not getting water any sooner. Finally we got our key to the room and we were told that our room is ready. I opened the door, there are still 2 people in the room and... well, un-dressed. I apologized to them and back to front desk and asked for a new room. We waited for another half hour. (While we are standing there, the stuff blame each other for the mistake they made.) They gave us another room and we found there is no water in our room. So we back to the lobby again, and the manager “promised” that when we come back in the evening, water will be available. So we went out and started our first day in NYC. After walking on the Time Square whole afternoon, we returned to hotel around 7:00PM- exhausted and smelled and of course we all wanted to take a shower. As soon as we get into the lobby, there are so many people argued with the hotel stuffs and things start to hit up- we Shockley found out the hotel had no water for TWO DAYS!!!! Many of the people didn’t shower for two days! Of course they are angry and frustrated. Unbelievable! My husband questioned the manager and asked him to tell us the truth- either the water will come or not. The manager said with really cold voice: “No body knows, I don’t know either, I hope the water will come tonight, but I don’t know, I cannot guarantee!” My husband tried to understand why they didn’t tell us they have this major problem when we check-in in the morning. And he wanted to know if they really have people fixing the water system or not- we didn’t see any plumbers or workers. The manager just totally ignored his questions and walked away. I also heard one of the hotel stuff shout to another man and a couple: “Don’t ask me, I don’t know, I don’t know (repeatedly), go away, OK? Stop asking me! If you don’t like, you can go! Go!” As you can imagine, people started to shout back to the stuff. There were also about 20-25 people waiting for the check in- some of them stop the check-in process and tried to get their money. Some of them just standing there hopelessly and don’t know what to do. My husband started to raise his temple as well. Allow me to point this out clearly, he is a very gentle and lovely person. I have known him for 12 years and I have never seen him like that. Like other people, he asked for the money back, the Asia lady told him “you can go if you wanted to go!” But she has no intention to return our money. We started to argue with her and she said: “Get out, get out! You get out of my hotel, I don’t want you THESE KIND OF PEOPLE here, don’t even thinking to stay here again!” “Excuse me, who wants to stay there ever again? I never ever again step in here even you give me money to stay here!” I found myself shouting back to her. After talked to my husband, we decided to leave. I cannot let my sister (who flied 18 hours to New York to join us) staying there. She was absolutely exhausted. We stormed back to our room and get our stuff down to the lobby and prepared to leave. There were even more people. We also saw two poor girls who lost their baggage and the guy who is in-charged for the storage room seems not care. He in his poor English, telling the girls: “I don’t know what happen to your stuff, they are gone. I have no idea who took them.” People started to lose control and one of the guy tired to bit up the hotel manager and the guy. The Asia lady is still shutting to people- by the by, she was standing behind bullet proofs glass the whole time. She keeps asking people to come up-front if they wanted to check-in!! No water in the building, and they still want people to check-in? It just doesn’t make any sense to me. My party and I were kicked out from the hotel at 9:30 PM at night in NYC. At that time, 99.9% of the hotels in the city are booked. We spent an hour to call all the hotels on the yellow page. Finally we found a four stars hotel for $410 a night. Needless to say, we have no choices- we ended up stay there. Over all, it’s such scary experience. And also this is why I detailed what happen that night in order to show you how bad the hotel is. I seriously think the hotel should be closed down.The quality of the meat was on par with your local grocery store.Greatly disappointed My hubby and I first stayed at Langham Place Hotel in July 2007 for four nights. We were very happy with the Hotel's service and room that we went home and raved about it. We even recommended friends and colleagues to stay at the Hotel when they planned for trips to HK. The Hotel had created a lasting impression on us.Our next trip to HK was in Aug 2008. Naturally, we decided that we wanted to stick with Langham Place Hotel for our two nights of accommodation. We were slightly disappointed when the room that greeted us was older than the last one but everything else was fine. So, we decided that an older room would not dampen our spirits.Our last trip to HK was Dec 2008 and of course, it had to be Langham Place Hotel. Unfortunately, all the standard rooms were booked and blocked when we made our reservation nearly two months before our trip. Not ready to give up our favourite Hotel for another one, we decided to splurge on a deluxe room or what the Hotel called an Essential Place room for three nights. It would definitely be worth it, we thought. After all, we were getting a rain shower and 42 plasma flat screen TV. We even requested for a King-sized bed like we always did.However, our happy relationship with the Hotel encountered its first hiccup when the receptionist told us that our room was not ready. It was almost 3 pm. They were experiencing full house, she said, but she could give us a room with a great view...and twin beds just for that night. I was stumped and I rejected her offer. After all, I made my reservation months ahead. Full house or not, a guest expected to be given her room when it was her turn to check in.And we finally did check in after more than an hour but this time it was a Queen-sized bed instead of a King-sized bed. I requested for another change. A lady from the front desk popped by to give us our new card keys and simply walked off, leaving us to wonder what to do with the old card keys. Finally we settled down in a new room with a faulty TV remote control. We told the receptionist about it and she was supposed to send someone to fix it but nobody came.We encountered another obstacle in our relationship when we requested for two pillows from the Pillow Menu the next evening. Of course they were not available because the Hotel was having a full house. The receptionist said she would note down my request and bring me the pillows the following evening if they were available but they did not appear on our last night. Neither did anyone bother to inform us that the pillows were not coming.On the day of check-out, we waited in the queue for almost 15 minutes for our turn. Finally, a counter was free but the gentleman refused to attend to more guests. So he kept his eyes glued on his screen, occasionally looking at his colleagues on his left and right from the corner of eyes and stealing glances at the queue in front of him. He probably felt that he had attended to too many guests over the past few minutes and so, it was time for his colleagues to catch up with the number. I was fuming as we had a plane to catch. Finally, another receptionist was available and it took only a minute to complete our check-out. She did not request for our feedback on our stay, unlike previously when the Hotel was eager to find out how it fared.The relationship came to a rude end when a bell boy refused to acknowledge our presence and our huge luggage at the level one entrance. We needed to catch a cab urgently to the airport and I was trying to get the bell boy's attention but he ignored me. His attitude was shocking as we had never ever encountered a staff who was so rude during our stay at the Hotel. Where was the Hotel that we used to love? Where were the warm staff whom we thought so highly of?After a few minute, the bell boy finally asked me where we were going and I told him. No, he did not smile. In fact, none of his colleagues at the entrance were friendly. When it was our turn to board the cab, he asked me again where were were heading without making eye contact. By this time, I was simply too stunned to do anything else but repeat my destination. He remained expressionless. When we boarded the cab, the driver asked us where we were heading! Obviously, the bell boy asked us for our destination twice and still did not tell the driver where we were going! What was that about?Langham Place Hotel might have established a good reputation when it was launched, one that was good enough to help it top the TripAdvisor choice hotel chart for a long time. However, it has started to become very complacent. I was surprised when it was ousted from its top position on the chart but now I think it deserves it.On Thursday, March 1st, I checked into the Downtowner Inn in Toronto, Ontario. I had made reservations online via their website, which stated I would receive a room with a double bed, a refrigerator, microwave, phone, and TV. I also requested a parking space, which would cost an additional $10 per day. As it so happened, this was the same day that Toronto was hit with a large snowstorm, which I had to drive approximately 4 hours through to get there. I arrived at the hotel and checked in at approximately 9:00 p.m. They had no record of me needing a parking space, but said they did have one available, and charged me the additional $10.00. I asked why I could not pay for both days I would be there and was told that it is assessed each day and I would have to stop in the office in the morning to pay for the next day. I then asked where I was to park and was told it was around back, behind the inn. As I made my way to park, my car was stuck several times in the snow. Another car was parked at an angle in back, which made it impossible for me to park my car without putting it in jeopardy of being hit when the other car left. I went inside to inquire about a shovel to have the parking area cleared and was met with questions as to what a shovel was. After explaining to the gentleman, he told me he would contact the maintenance man, to see if either heâ€™d come shovel the drive or tell the manager on duty where the shovel was. At no point in time did the manager on duty appear to call the maintenance man nor locate a shovel. By pure luck, I found a shovel in back of the inn and proceeded to shovel off the parking area myself â€“ as it was late, I needed to park, and I wanted to rest. Upon turning in for the night, I realized there was no phone in my room, my TV did not work, and I could easily hear the people in the next-door room talking. Throughout the night loud noises, people talking, and TVs awakened me. The check-in papers I received said no loud noises after 10:00 p.m., which was not upheld. At approximately 7:00 a.m., many people were walking through the halls, talking, laughing, and making a lot of noise â€“ which I found to be quite disturbing to trying to get my rest. A continental breakfast was included with the room rental. However, when I went to the area it was supposed to be in, all I found were empty bread wrappers and jelly jars. Even though my reservations were for two evenings, I felt that unless something was drastically done to uphold what I felt were the reservations I had made, I no longer wished to stay in this inn. I went to the front desk and attempted to speak with the current manager on duty, to explain to him that my room was not as described in the online booking information, that my TV did not work, there was no phone, I had to shovel my own parking area, and there was no breakfast available. He proceeded to tell me that if I was dissatisfied with my room, I should have come to the front desk immediately before falling asleep and found a different place to stay. He also informed me that a budget hotel does not have to offer amenities such as TVs and phones, that a continental breakfast was provided upstairs and I must have been too slow to get to it, that it was not his fault nobody called about the shovel or to speak with the maintenance man, and that I should have found a different place to park. I informed him that I would like my money refunded, as I did not receive what I was supposed to. He began to get upset with me and I told him that the customer service I was receiving was horrid, to which he replied â€œcustomer service does not exist in Torontoâ€� and I could â€œtake myself back to Yankeeland where they eat oil and wage war on innocent peopleâ€�. Any subsequent pleas on my part to get the situation rectified was met with more disdain against US citizens, accusations that I was responsible for people being at war, and that I expected too much from a budget inn, that anything that price would be exactly the same. When my husband came to see what was going on, the manager on duty physically threatened him by cocking back his hand to hit him. I attempted to explain that we visit Toronto on a yearly basis and have stayed at many other establishments in the area, for a similar price, but had never had a problem with any of them. He told me that there was no way I could have stayed at those places for those prices and told me that I got what I paid for. He then had another man come in who also told me that I was expecting too much and did not know what I was talking about, since â€œCanadaâ€™s hotel prices never changeâ€� and there was no way I could have ever stayed at any of the other places for a similar rate. Eventually, the manager on duty said he would reverse the charges and that I would have to call to speak with the hotel manager. He would not tell me his name nor put anything into writing, saying his word was good. I have called every day since then, at least twice, and the hotel manager has always â€œjust left.â€� Regardless of what time he is supposed to be there the next day, if I call, he has â€œjust leftâ€�. I do not feel my money will be refunded and will be taking the proper steps to dispute the charges on my credit card. I feel that the Downtowner Inn is a disgrace to the city of Toronto. I have never been more offended by someone than I was there and have never received such poor customer service in all my travels. I do not feel that the hotel manager, Mike Dluhy (not sure of spelling, only pronunciation), runs his establishment in a good way nor does he care about how his customers are treated. Since I have returned to my home, I have been looking up information online and have yet to read a single good review of the Downtowner Inn. It would seem that I was not the first person to be poorly treated at this establishment, nor will I be the last if it is allowed to continue operation.Executive Summary-- This is probably the cheapest hotel in Playacar. Nevertheless I never thought that it was going to have poor service when it came to solving problems for the guests. If your stay is uneventful I'm sure you won't have any problem with this hotel. The problem arises when you have an issue. Then the lack of customer services will make your stay unbearable. Full Story-- My wife and I decided to stay in the Wyndham Maya last November because it looked nice and it was well located. We were traveling for a wedding in Xcaret and we wanted to stay with the bride & groom (that stayed in this hotel too). In terms of "cleanliness" I don't have anything to complain. The rooms in general were clean and the public bathrooms too. Not necessarily true for the buffets and some areas around the swimming pools but that is ok, it is understandable. In terms of "location", I like where it's located. The hotel is located in Playacar. Playacar is a neighborhood next to the town of Playa del Carmen. You can walk from the hotel to Playa del Carmen in 30 minutes. In terms of "rooms", this is definitively the cheapest hotel in Playacar so the rooms are not quite "luxurious". If I needed to compare it to a 3 star hotel in the US, I'll say that the room at this hotel are average. The problem is that you need to compare it to the other hotels in Playacar with the same price range and in that case the rooms are less than average. There is no internet connection in the rooms. The wi-fi (internet cloud) doesn't even get near to the rooms. In terms of "value", this hotel is cheap so for those trying to save a buck or two, it could look like a great option. Now, the problem is that in reality you have to pay for some services that I found important. For example, internet. You need to pay for internet (common in some of the hotels in Playa del Carmen not in others). The problem is that even when you pay you are going to have problem with it. First, internet almost never works, even when you are in the recommended locations. Second, you have to logging every time to want to use it. It doesn't allow for an automatic connection and the logging process is really really painful because the password assigned to you has 16 characters that are randomly selected. So every time you log in you need to pull out your receipt to remember the password. Third, there are only 2 locations where you get internet (next to the lobby and next to one of the swimming pool). No internet in the rooms. In terms of "sleep quality" the rooms were below average. The beds were ok but the walls are relatively thin. So if you can sleep with noise outside your room, this hotel should be ok with you. In terms of "service", it was terrible. The people serving us in the buffet were great. The same for those supporting the different activities. The problem was more with the people in the front desk, customer service and concierge service. When you reserve at this hotel they tell you that you have some choices additionally to the restaurant-buffet. For the Wyndham, these options are basically 6 restaurants, 3 in the Maya location and 3 in the Azteca location. What they never tell you is that to reserve in any of these restaurants you need 2-3 days in advance. This logistics doesn't make sense when you are staying in the hotel less than 4 days. It is really difficult to reserve a table in any of these restaurants. They are always "full". The funny thing is that when you go to the restaurant directly you can see that half of the tables are empty for those days were they were supposed to be "full". My believe here is that this illogical arrangement has to do with two things: 1. They need to know in advance the number of people to be able to prepare (and that's ok). 2. the hotel limits the amount of people eating in each restaurant each night to avoid losing money (and that's not ok-- don't give me a false sense of options when you can't deliver on those options). Other comments-- Everything was going "so-so" until the other wedding guests started to arrive. The bride & groom had organized several tours and the meeting point was the Wyndham Maya. When the first group arrive to the hotel, the security guard didn't allow them to enter the property. We understood that because it was an 'all-inclusive' we would have this problem. Nevertheless we thought that we could reach an agreement were for example all the wedding guest could meet in the parking lot of the hotel (without entering the hotel). The security manager didn't allow us to do that. We were furious because the manager had told 3 months ago the bride & groom that they would allow the hotel to be the meeting point. We didn't want the wedding guest to enter the hotel and consume without paying, we just wanted to meet somewhere so we could decide where to go after. Pretty simple but the Wyndham Maya employees were not even trying to help us at this point. The next day we had a similar problem with an even more irrespectful Wyndham Maya employee and this time it wasn't with any wedding guest but with the parent of the bride. To make the story short we decided to leave the hotel. All the wedding guests staying at the Wyndham Maya decided the same. That day 20 people left the hotel (~10 rooms) and the manager didn't do anything to stop it until it was really too late. We decided to switch hotels and went to the Mosquito Blue in Playa del Carmen. What a difference! great location and great service.Please read this review as it is 100% honest and is intended to warn future travelers about the Holiday Inn LAX. The purpose of my trip was for 6 adult business partners and clients - all traveling seperately and with no personal relationships to spend a week in Los Angeles to attend and work at a major music event. I made the reservation through Priceline and was guaranteed accommodation for 6 adults, with 3 hotel rooms. Upon arrival in 3 cars, we were stopped at the front gate - which is approx. 1/4 of a mile away from the hotel entrance - by a barrier which required us to push a button to validate each car and would charge us $16 per car, per night for parking. Quickly doing some math at the gate I figured that 3 cars for 7 days at $16 per car was going to cost me an extra $336 + 9.5% tax!! This by itself was a huge shock to me as it was a drastic expense for which I had neither planned, budgeted or been told about. They literally wait until you are at the front gate! Obviously, having just got off a red eye flight, we all just wanted to get to bed. At the desk I spoke to the manager on duty, Rodolfo Guitierez, about the parking. His immediate reaction took all of us by surprise...he stated that we should go and park elsewhere if we're not happy. He then started laughing and joking in Spanish to his staff which made me afraid for my safety as I was in a city I had never visited before. He would even start to address me in Spanish and then convert back to English mid-sentence. Is this the type of point-of-contact customer service that Holiday Inn is training their employees, especially managers? It was very clear that this man was tired, angry and had a very short temper. Any kind of bargaining or simple question was shot down in flames with a very stern "will that be all senor?". I am Sir not Senor. At this point, whilst realizing that I'm going to have to fork out for the parking, I just wanted some sleep. This next part just blows my mind. All 6 of us went to our respective 3 reserved rooms and looked on in horror as we discovered that each room only had 1 bed. This is the first time in my entire traveling life that I have booked a room for 2 people where they only give you 1 bed. I immediately thought that there was a mistake, so I went to the front desk again, to speak to the same manager, again. I told him that there are 6 of us so we need 6 beds. He very aggressively told me that each room now only has 1 bed and for a second bed there is a surcharge of $22 per night. Again, calculating 3 extra beds at $22 per night per bed for 7 days, I was looking at an additional $462 + 9.5% tax. This made the situation very distressing, as I had chosen this run down hotel at a cheaper rate with priceline and now realized that for the same price I could have stayed in a 5 star hotel in Hollywood. I tried to reason with the manager and explain my situation but he was clearly in no mood to talk to guests. He has obviously dealt with this same subject with many, many previous guests as he was almost expecting my questions and was basically ignoring them. He told me to call Priceline and move aside to allow other guests to check in. I called Priceline and had quite possibly the longest, most pointless conversation with a middle eastern girl who would not answer any questions. I asked for a supervisor and was told that there are no supervisors. I hung up. I then called Holiday Inn corporate office and spoke to a man who was very nice and told me he would contact the hotel manager to resolve the problem. I then received a call to my room from the same manager as before, Rodolfo, who yelled at me that if I wanted extra beds, I should just pay for them or just share a bed. Unfortunately, the hotel and Priceline won the battle by just shutting off communication and refusing to remedy the problems. After much screaming, tearing hair out and long phone calls, we were forced to remain at the hotel and share beds, as well as paying hundreds of dollars just to park our cars. I am truly disgusted. My whole company are disgusted and please be assured that none of us will ever stay at a Holiday Inn or use Priceline again. Ever. An awful experience which ruined the entire trip. Is this what travel has come down to? Desperate hotels and booking companies letting morals fly out the window and adding charge after charge for meaningless nonsense such as a parking spot or an additional bed? One thing is clear - you are no longer a guest at a hotel, you are a cash cow, in every sense of the word. All in all I was quite pleased with the cleanliness and location, but from the bottom of my heart and speaking from alot of traveling experience, this was the worst and rudest staff and management my business partners and I have ever, ever encountered. BEWARE.I wish I had read more hotel reviews before booking this hotel! I don't consider myself to be a picky traveler and I consider the hotel, just a place to stay when you are not out having fun. I tried to ignore the short falls of the hotel but in the end there were just way too many!! We arrived late at night on Feb. 20th. They put us in a corner room in building five and everything seemed great. As we start unpacking (11:30 pm) we notice that we are in a 3 bedroom 2 bath instead of a 3 bedroom, 3 bath. We called downstairs to find out what was going on and then found out that they had no 3 bedroom 3 baths open, and that we would have to wait until the next day after checkout (9am - 11am) to move. I couldn't believe they wouldn't have told us that at the desk when we checked in???!!!! They just put us in the wrong room and acted like nothing was wrong. So the next morning we had to then repack everything and delay our kids from going to Disney. We hung out in the lobby for an hour waiting for word on our room. Finally at 11 they told us to go to Disney and that they would move our belongings to our new room and everything would be ready when we came back. Lie #2 Nothing had been done when we returned back to the hotel. We had to move all of our things to tower one, a dirty room overlooking the parking lot of the Factory outlet. Lie #3 They then told us how sorry they were and that they would comp our room the first night. (Read Below - this was another lie) Lie#3 My husband was in Orlando on business and had to have the internet. He called the hotel ahead of time to make sure they had wifi. Needless to say, we were never able to get any internet connection in our room. He went out and purchased a cable and we were still never able to get any access. The hotel then lied again to say usually they do have access but it was down. When we finally moved into our room in tower one at 9:30 pm my young kids were worn out and ready for bed. We went to make up the couch bed only to find the sheets were the wrong size. We called to get sheets and they told us they would be right up(Lie #4). 35 minutes later still no sheets. I had to get dressed and go down to the lobby to get them to send sheets up to our room. We wore flip flops in our room because it was so dirty. We stopped using the kitchen because there were small spider looking bugs everywhere. We didn't notice them at first, but they got into our cereal boxes. So we threw everything away and ate at Dunkin Donuts for breakfast and the Irish pub for dinner. The burger there was delicious! We spent no time out on our balcony because it overlooked a parking lot - very disappointing. The kids did enjoy getting in the tubs in the bathroom every night and relaxing after a long day in the parks. My kids complained a few times that they had bites behind their knees and underarms. I ignored it thinking maybe mosquitoes. After reading reviews since I returned from my trip I see many people have complained about bed bugs. I am wincing in disgust hoping that I did not bring any home with me. If I did there will be a major PROBLEM! The swimming pool was great. The kids loved the slide and the hot tubs were very relaxing. The life guard had to leave the slide closed several times to constantly get more towels, that was kind a bummer for my boys. Also, plan well, because as the sun goes down the pool is shaded and cold. They told us they were not going to charge us for the first night. At checkout they then told my husband they were not going to charge us for two nights because of the problems with the room and internet. Upon getting our bill we noticed that they only discounted our bill for the resort fee for two nights - that's 20 dollars. Careful with the taxi drivers at the hotel they wanted to charge us 30 dollars to bring us to the parks and 65 to the airport. Sadly we paid that not knowing we could get it a lot cheaper. Shame on them for taking advantage and shame on the hotel for letting them. We rented a van so my husband could get back and forth to his class. Parking was very limited and sometimes you just had to park on the road or park far away from your tower. In conclusion ( after reading reviews about this hotel for the last year) it seems like the hotel is going downhill rapidly!!! There may still be some good rooms left in the newer towers. If you are staying here you may want to contact those people who wrote good reviews and ask what their room number was. I was in building one on the 7th floor - I would stay away from this whole tower! Good Luck If my bill is not resolved I am considering reporting this hotel to the better business bureau. I am definitely following up on the bed bug investigation someone mentioned in their post.My husband and I visited the Mandarin Oriental in January of this year hoping to experience the true luxury and service promised by such a prestigious brand. The first part of our trip was to the Ritz Carlton in Cancun, where we were treated with personal service by a staff that truly cared about our satisfaction. After one day at the Mandarin, with people who ignored our every request, and management that tried to justify the staff's dismissive attitude by noting that it was simply our "perception" I wanted to burst in to tears and wished dearly that we had never left the Ritz Carlton. Being frequent travellers, we are very aware of the levels of service that can be expected throughout the world. The staff at the Mandarin Oriental Riviera Maya was outright rude, and could not meet simple requests for Housekeeping Service, Transportation, or general reservation requests. All of these things on their own would be less significant if they were not compounded by an acting manager who kept us waiting for at least 30 minutes on one day, and failed to show up to a meeting on the next. Although we expected a proactive response from the Corporate office upon our return home, it took 30 days of follow up emails and phone calls to get an answer, and in the end we were offered the opportunity to make another reservation at an equally overpriced rate during the low season. Please know our issues are not just our perception, but we spoke with several other guests during our trip who had very similar problems with the service and availability of the amenities at this resort. My warnings to fellow travellers are: - 16% service charge on top of all other rates and fees that is supposed to cover service that is terrible- totally unjustified - Be prepared to walk because it is very difficult to catch the promised golf cart to navigate the large resort - You can better count on the surrounding resorts to help you with transportation between the Mayakoba area. Mandarin promises an Escalade or similar but we were offered a small questionable taxi on more than one occassion. - The concierge is as useful about the surrounding area as Google. You may as well explore blindfolded as they have no recommendations outside their resort. - If you do plan on utilizing the outlets at the resort don't assume they will be open. Most were closed during our visit despite the high season. - Service in the beach and pool area is very limited and slow although the area is beautiful. We had better luck walking down the beach to a neighboring resort where we got great service, and staff rotated the area cleaning sunglasses, serving cold fruit, etc... Mandarin obviously doesn't feel the need to go above and beyond. The general attitude was of entitlement and lack of urgency. I highly recommend if you are staying in Riviera Maya choose a neighbor such as the Banyan Tree or Rosewood, or stay in Cancun at the Ritz Carlton, where they will really make you feel at home. Here is our letter to the company which received no appropriate response: "My husband and I have just returned to our Texas home after a very disturbing stay at your Riviera Maya property. We would greatly appreciate a personal conversation with yourself or someone at the appropriate level to address the very disconcerting experience we feel should be urgently addressed. Because it is fair that you have some background information prior to speaking with us I will give you a brief description of our concerns. Our initial impression was during a dinner we had at Ambar on Sunday, January 3rd. During our dinner we asked several times for information on room availability because we were so intrigued by the beauty of the resort. Unfortunately after several attempts to make a reservation on site we were told by the concierge on the way out to call the 800 # the next day. Since we are both in the hospitality business, we found it curious that our reservation wouldn't be handled on site, especially since we were offering our credit card right away to book a suite. Perhaps this should have been a warning to us. Rather than calling the 800# the next day we called the resort and requested to speak with a manager and received a call back from Mr. Fernando Gibaja. While we were enjoying a wonderful stay at the Ritz Carlton Cancun, where we normally stay, we expected an elevated level of service comparable to the incredible decor of the Riviera Maya resort, and in line with Mandarin Oriental's reputation. Mr. Gibaja was helpful in getting us a reservation for three nights (January 5 - 8, 2010) and transporting us from the Ritz Carlton. We felt that Mr. Gibaja handled our call gracefully and we were excited to experience your resort. Unfortunately we never heard from Mr. Gibaja again, and learned during our stay that the General Manager (Patrick Dennis Finnet) was no longer employed at the resort. Perhaps the breakdown in management contributed to the many breakdowns in service we experienced. Unfortunately that does not excuse them. Upon our arrival on Tuesday, the 5th, our excitement was quickly squashed. After experiencing several distressing service issues each day we requested to speak with a manager only to be pacified or ignored by front line staff members. On our final day we spoke with the Assistant General, "Fred", who never followed up with us or addressed any of our issues. Some of the issues included being ignored by staff, no service in the restaurants or pool area, incomplete housekeeping services, not being offered any information about the resort's outlets, etc... When Fred did speak with us, very briefly, we were told that our issues were simply our "perception" of the resort. In addition, he made the assumption that we had a problem at the Ritz Carlton, which could not be further from the truth. In fact, we were sad to be at the Mandarin, where we were ignored, not greeted, and dismissed when requesting help rather than spending our last few days with the warm, caring, willing and attentive staff at the Ritz Carlton. While the resort is stunningly beautiful and the room product beyond compare, the staff attitude, carelessness, and dismissiveness of the management was certainly not in line with what earned this property it's 5 diamonds; nor was it in keeping with Mandarin Oriental service expectations. I can assure you it was not "gracious and sincere and steeped in the values of the orient" as your mission indicates. "I chose to stay at Le Piano because 1) it was new and looked cute in the pictures, and 2) it had gotten a lot of glowing reviews on TripAdvisor during its short time in operation. I booked the room in complete confidence, and I really wish I had something nice to say, instead of what I'm about to. Let me preface this review by saying that I am a mellow, easygoing person who has traveled to hundreds of hotels all over the world, mostly for business. I'm no stranger to no-frills operations, but even without the horrifying thing that happened to me, this hotel would still have ranked at bottom of all the hotels I've ever stayed at. To wit: I arrived in Istanbul on a hot, muggy day in July, and they put me in a room (number 101) without functioning air conditioning. This, despite the fact that the hotel advertised that each room had individually-controlled AC units. Someone had apparently tried to compensate for this deficiency by putting a small fan next to the bed. Not terribly helpful. To make matters worse, only one of the two windows in the bedroom could be opened all the way. The other could only be opened a crack. The hotel did not supply sheets or blankets, as one might expect with, well, any normal hotel. Instead, the bed was covered with a single thin, scratchy bed spread that was too small to even cover the bed from end to end. The toilet paper holder fell clean out of the wall with the gentlest tug on the roll, and could not be reattached. The lights in the hallway were on power-save mode. They were programmed to turn off within two seconds of any detected movement. This meant that I had to fumble for my key card in the dark, or constantly pace back and forth in the hallway while digging through my purse, to avoid an annoying strobe-like effect. The minibar fridge didn't keep things cold. I don't usually use the minibar for snacking, but I had some medication that needed to be refrigerated, and I do use minibars for that purpose. Destroyed. Half the time, the elevator didn't seem to work. Didn't bother me much, because I was only 2 flights up. Also, there was no phone in the room. ---------------------------------------------- And this is where things really started to go south... Resigning to the fact that I was going to be hot and uncomfortable, I took a quick cold shower, opened the one functioning window, threw the bedspread aside, deadbolted the door and climbed into bed au naturelle, wrapped in a towel. I woke up a little after midnight to find the door hanging open, and a middle-aged, non-english-speaking man wandering around my room (which, as you might remember, had been deadbolted before I went to bed). I was a little disoriented, but it struck me as deeply troubling that a strange man was carrying on in my room while I'm in bed naked. I grabbed the blanket as quickly as I could to cover myself, and as I fumbled around the bed looking for something to bludgeon him with if things turned south, I asked him what the hell he was doing in my room. He said something, but not in any language I could understand. I asked him to get out. He didn't. He wandered around my room for probably less than a minute, but it felt like an eternity. Finally, when it became that he wouldn't respond to a polite request to leave, I screamed at the top of my lungs for him to get the F out of my room. Thank god, he did. I deadbolted the door again, not sure exactly what had happened, and I looked for a phone to call the front desk, but there wasn't one. I put on the clothes I had been wearing earlier that day, and walked to the front desk to ask if they could tell me why a man had shown up in my room in the middle of the night, uninvited. The concierge didn't seem to know what to do, but I just stood there telling him again and again that someone had shown up in my room while I was sleeping, and I really didn't like it. Finally, a bellhop showed up and the concierge said, "is it this guy?" I said that it was not. They talked back and forth in Turkish, and the concierge ended up telling me, by way of explanation, that the bellhop had let the strange man into my room because he had forgotten his room key somewhere, and I guess gotten our rooms mixed up since we were on the same floor. Furthermore, according to the concierge, the reason that the strange man didn't leave right away was because he was confused and thought I was his wife. I said I wanted to move to a different room because I was 1) sweltering hot and 2) really scared, but the concierge said there was no need for that, and that he would just reprogram my room lock so that no key but mine could open my door. In other words, the hotel master keys would be disabled. He must have said "please trust us" like 20 times. He couldn't seem to understand, why a young single woman, traveling alone, would have such a big problem with what had just happened to me. He kept saying "just trust us." But why? Trust has to be earned. What kind of hotel lets strangers wander into other people's rooms without double checking to see if they really belong there? What kind of hotel has doors that will open from the outside when they've been deadlocked from within? I would have left the hotel right then, but it was nearly one o'clock in the morning, no taxis in the streets, and I had no idea where else to go. So I went upstairs again, but I really can't say I slept for the rest of the night. The next morning, I went downstairs to find a different concierge, who agreed to let me change rooms. I went back to my room to find that my door key didn't work, but one of the maids passing by swiped her master key, which worked just fine. So the concierge from the night before was either a complete incompetent, or he lied to me about reprogramming the lock. Anyway, I changed rooms to one with functioning AC and windows and I stayed at the hotel for the full 3 nights I had prebooked, but I would never stay there again or recommend it to anyone else. This once-in-a-lifetime experience cost me 295 euros (3 nights). You couldn't pay me to stay there again.Let me start by saying that I travel frequently on business, and have for well over 20 years. I ended up staying here last week because I failed to account for the NYC Christmas crowds, and was unable to get a room at one of the places at which I usually stay. Every negative review you read here is 100% right on! Anything positive you read here is inaccurate and misleading. (I must note though that the hotel staff themselves were all friendly and tried their best to be accomodating. They simply don't have much to work with here.) The simple fact is that this hotel should not be allowed to operate as is. I have stayed in many, many different places all over the world, and have never experienced anything as bad as this. Like a couple of the other reviewers, I too merely needed a place to sleep, and wasn't overly concerned about the lack of amenities. (The last I heard however, "cleanliness" and "sanitary" weren't considered "amenities".) There are far too many things wrong with this place to list, but I'll try. It is unclean - and I mean everything. The entrance, lobby (if you can call it that), the shoebox sized elevator, the hallways, the room (and every single thing in it), and the bathroom. The sheets were threadbare and did not appear or smell clean, there were clumps of hair on the pillows which certainly weren't mine. (It was to the point that I wondered if they rented these rooms out by the hour during the day, when most of the patrons were either working or out sightseeing.) The walls and ceiling were badly stained. The carpeting almost defies description - filthy indoor/outdoor carpeting, which kind of "crackled" when you walked on it, and which was cut out around the bed and dresser, as though whoever put it in was too lazy to move the furniture first. The mattress was as hard as a rock, and also provided that lovely "crackling" sound when you sat in it. (My therapist has advised me that it would be in my best interest to try to forget the details of the "comforter" on top of the bed.) The bathroom lterally had piles of debris/hair/ etc... in each corner. I wanted to wear my shoes in the tub, never mind even considering taking a bath in it. No shampoo was provided of course. I am thankful that it wasn't summertime, because I have no doubt that the place would be chock full of bugs, cockroaches, and who knows what else. I had to scrub the dresser drawers before I put my clothing in them. I lined them with plastic bags as well. Let's see, none of the windows were openable, there were noisy, inconsiderate people coming and going all night long - up and down the 5 foot wide hallways, making no effort whatsoever to try to be quiet. The neighborhood, although not the best/safest, and certainly not what you are led to expect (by hotels or Expedia) by any stretch of the imagination, wasn't terrible, and was convenient to Times Square and the Theater District. The TV got about 20 channels - of these, 3 were in Spanish, 3 were Oriental, and most of the balance didn't come in well enough to either watch or listen to. From the outside, this hotel bears absolutely no resemblance to the picturesque little brownstone you see on the Internet. It is a squat, drab little place, with the word "Hotel" handwritten on the back of a sheet of printer paper, taped to the door. (There were some sort of dead, skinned fowl (I think they were ducks) hanging in the window immediately to the left of the entrance. There is also apparently a place very nearby that has been rented to a fledgling rock band (and trust me, they are very early on in their careers), which is used for their nightly practice session, which thankfully seemed to wrap up at about 10:30 PM. It is also billed as an "Internet Cafe". This portion of their business consisted of two computers on TV trays (or something similar) in the already crowded lobby. I didn't see anything that would render the term "Cafe" an appropriate name for the business. When I returned home, I washed everything, whether I had worn it or not, and brought my suits and ties to the dry cleaners. (I neglected to mention that there wasn't a closet in my room - I was forced to hang all of my clothes on the wall-mounted clothes rod, for all the world to see while the maid was "cleaning??" my room.) I should also mention that this is the second room I had here - I was in the first one for about 30 seconds before I was on the (dirty, sticky) phone calling the front desk insisting on a different room. They were equally disgusting, but at least in the second room, I was able to get into the bathroom without the need to sandwich myself against the filthy wall and slide sideways into it. (I am not a big person either - 5'8" and 155 lbs). As for climate controls - there was no lack of heat, in fact there was no controlling the heat. It was stifling all night long. I peeled off the "comforter" and "blanket" and just slept with the dirty sheet. (Even now I shudder at the recollection.) I am most surprised that this was listed as a halfway decent place on Hotels. In fact, the only reason I remained here was due to the fact that as I had booked the room on hotels, I had already paid for it. I sensed that if I mentioned anything about a refund to the person at the front desk, I would have been laughed out into the street. (Which in itself would have been an upgrade.) The room was not inexpensive - $109/night for the first few nights and then $149/night for the final night. The bottom line is that people should not be expected to shell out that kind of money and then end up in a place like this. If this is the new baseline for price/value in NYC, then shame on the hotel industry. My advice would be to either plan your trip well in advance, and you absolutely can get a decent room in this price range (or even for slightly less) in the city, albeit with a little advance planning; or as an alternative, simply budget a little more for this expense. If you can't afford to spend a little more, you would be well-advised to postpone your trip untilyou can. As for me, I will never, ever stay here again!This was my 4th stay at the MGM Grand over the 15 years I've been going to Vegas and like all the previous times I've been there, I came out extremely disappointed this time as well. In the past I've stayed at hotels rated much lower than the MGM (ie: the Excalibur, Holiday-inn, etc.), but in all honesty, I've never had so many problems! My first preference when I go to Vegas is naturally the Wynn (if I can manage to find a good deal online) and if not the Wynn, then either the Mirage, Bellagio or Treasure Island - whichever one fits my particular budget. Since I was with a group and money was an object, we decided to *settle* for the MGM where we received a Player's Club rate of $79/night. I have never really been a fan of the MGM Grand in the past, but was some how convinced by others that this time would be different. And that I was sure to end up having a great time. Sure! Why not? (NOT!) Regardless of how much you pay for your room, you should always expect the best service. It's not like the bell guy, or casino staff know how much you paid. For all they know, I may have paid $149-$179/night (the posted rate on their website). So where do I start? We check-in at the airport to avoid the massive line ups at the hotel...the check-in was fine, only about 5-6 minutes and I had my keys. We get to the hotel go up the elevators and about 5 miles and 15 minutes later we finally reach our room. We were told the room was a newly renovated room, with new beds, furniture, etc. I made sure we received a Grand Tower room (supposedly 450 sq ft) and not one of those "new" dinky West Wing rooms (325 sq ft). The room: Why don't I just go ahead and list the problems...1. The room has no mirror on the outside, but instead has two inside the washroom! 2. The sink, the toilet and the tub all had problems with draining and flushing. The sink would fill up within 2-3 minutes while just trying to wash your face! When I asked for a change in rooms, they claimed to be full. Well then why was I able to book additional rooms on their website? BS! ***3. BED BUGS!!! My cousin ended up getting about 12 bed bug bites all over her leg! Funny enough, as soon as she got into her bed, she complained about being itchy, but just figured that it was either her imagination or nothing more than a general itch. What happens? She wakes up the next morning with all those bites. So we walk over to the front desk and let them know about it. The lady said that I have to first file a complaint with security and then come back and she'll definitely upgrade us to a better/cleaner room. After spending about an hour with security and giving them a report on her bed bug bites (formal report, pictures, etc). We went back to the front desk and requested a room change, but weren't going to be happy with just another standard room. We wanted either a portion of our money back, or a better room. The lady said she wasn't able to do anything until they took my cousin to a doctor, had her examined and in addition to that they would also have to collect samples from the room and send them off to the lab. Without doing any of that, the best she could do is change our room. So let me get this straight, you're spending 3 nights in Vegas, you discover your leg the next morning with nothing but bed bug bites all over it, you go to the front desk, they make you go through security.. .and then they want to ruin your entire trip by sending you to a doctor for 2 days? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I asked to speak to the manager immediately...a couple minutes later the lady comes back and tells me that they're short staffed and that the manager cannot leave the video/security screens that he's watching at the back (really? since when does a front desk manager have to watch video screens at the back?) I then asked to be able to speak to him over the phone. A completely useless conversation with an uneducated individual who claimed to be the manager. The problems don't stop here...but were all over the hotel! Horrible pool area where you find people gathered like sardines on broken and rusted pool chairs, broken washrooms throughout the hotel, unfriendly staff, rude security officers, you name it. 5000+ rooms and they're short staffed? Give me a break! his hotel is operated by the world's 2nd largest gaming company! My 4th stay at the MGM was definitely my last...regardless of the group, or rate or circumstance, there is absolutely no way I am going back to this hotel (if I can call it that). Be it torn bed sheets, an hour to receive an extra ice bucket or roaches in the room (all past problems) and now the bed bugs...there is no way someone is going to convince me when it comes to the MGM.We've been to several 'Premier' resorts in the Caribbean with an all inclusive status including another in Mexico on the Riviera Maya and can quite honestly we were very disappointed with the Occidental. My partner is very hot on checking the resort using Trip Advisor and other sources but this one slipped through the net when it came to quality. We arrived about 7pm and it was just getting dark as we checked in and by the time we gave the room number to the bell boy it was dark. He gave us a few directions on how to get to the block 'it's easy just go down there etc.' No offer of transport to the room and when I asked he looked blankly at me so off we trekked to find block 15. It was impossible in the dark, I fell over some stupid crazy paving that had gaps in to let water flow through by the shops and as we'd been up since 6am and had a ten hour flight plus an hour delay we were both so tired. We ended up finding the block after asking several people who gave us what seemed like conflicting directions by this time my girlfriend was in tears and exhausted.. There was just no need for this given that all that was required was a trip on their motor wagon that goes around the site all the time. But no! We had two double beds in our room but wanted one large bed. They are only 4ft 6 inch beds which are tiny in comparison to anywhere we've been before. The rooms are dark too. There are only two power points so if you want to charge a camera or put a mozzie machine in it's not enough by the time you want to dry your hair or plug in a styling wand. The furniture is dark and it doesn't help that there are few manky lights making it almost impossible to see into the wardrobe as the doors obscure the light. The whole holiday was filled with disappointments like this. The beach is a complete joke..it's not a beach more a building site. The sand looks like the sand you put into a child's play pen and totally unnatural. There are so many beds there that it was claustrophobic beyond belief and the staff at the bar were surly and unfriendly. The water in the 'bay' that laps the beach is dirty and full of scum on top. At first glance it looks clean but as you go around the edges and especially the bit near the bar and the path from the restaurant side there's a load of floating algae and scum...horrible. We only went in one day and never went again. The problem is that the restrictive flow of water through the outlet to the sea doesn't allow for the water to be refreshed often enough so you are bathing in everyone's dirt from the beach. I suspect the fish that live there have acclimatised to it and survive only because people feed them. The pool by the blocks 14, 15 and 16 was generally very clean although we sat at the end near the towel hut and where the steps to enter the pool and there was a whole host of debris and what looked like vomit floating on the top. This happened two days to our knowledge and we reported it. No-one came to clean it however until the next morning. We did end up down the other end but that in fact was a shallow entry so all the little kids were there shouting and yelling. We came away for peace and quiet...not to be found here. The drinks are weak too. I had to stop them putting too much ice in as as soon as you're back to your seat the drink is diluted to water. They ran out of beer regularly at the pool and even fizzy orange. The bar staff at the pool were good and worked tirelessly even under pressure from those that insist on ordering double or triple rounds. The food I think was the most disappointing. Very little variety in the main buffet although they try with theme nights it doesn't change much. It is bland and tasteless with crockery never next to the areas that demand it. ie no dessert bowls ever and you have to take a soup bowl or a plate. There is good ice cream but spoiled by thoughtless parents allowing their cherubs to poke their fingers in it or lick the spoons of the sauce toppings. I caught one child lick the chocolate sauce spoon and put it straight back into the dish with it in. I'm glad I did because I avoided that like the plague. The specialist restaurants were pretty much OK. Although the service like most of the resort was very poor and of course as you are not paying the staff directly what can you say to complain?? The steak house was good, the fish and oriental. We don't like Mexican food much so never tried that. I will say that the house white wine that comes as part of the all inclusive was quite palatable and not bad, the red was a bit rough but still drinkable. The entertainment to our mind was repetitive and boring. We know from our last foray into Mexico that it's a weak area but this was grim. It reminded me of Maplins although an international version. We used to go for a walk or a drink in the lobby bar then go to bed it was a treat to relax without the row. One or two mornings we were woken at 715am with the garden staff strimming the grass edges right outside our window. It was deafening. I accept they have to start somewhere to keep it neat but at least after 8am would have been the very earliest.. Xcaret Park was fun. It can get very hot in there and it's a good idea to go early. We did the river swim and some sightseeing and went back another day and did a bit more then went to the evening show which was well worth it. Also don't miss the horses at 5.40 pm that's great It's just inside where the donkeys and the Indian cow lay in that paddock. The Mexican girls riding side-saddle are fabulous.The Mariachi band plays all the while it's going on, very good. As is the Mayan village where there's a show at about 4'ish every day fabulous. I think in general that the Occidental is an OK place that could be much better given some care. How the Americans and Canadians put up with it I don't know. I can tell you that we saw a much higher level of British traveler there than usual in the Caribbean and even though we are British we were disappointed at the families' general demeanour, behaviour and manners. It was almost always the Brits that looked the scruffiest and had the worst behaved children. One has to ask how they managed to take them out of school too? I think the beach area was my girlfriend's biggest sadness. It is not acceptable especially as there's nowhere to go get into the beautiful ocean other than this scummy beach. We certainly won't be going back and I wonder in fact if the area in Mexico will suffer from over exposure from Europeans who want a resort that gives what Spain once did but with free drinks.I pull up to the hotel in my rental car where I'm greeted by a hotel employee. I ask if they have parking. He says no, but I can park the car in a metered spot while I check in. The meter is broken, I look around for no parking signs, there are none, so I figure I'm good. I enter the lobby which looks ok enough, except there's a homeless guy slurping on a coffee in what appears to be some sort of automat like area which opens onto the lobby. OK, I'm from NYC, so homeless guys aren't a big deal, but certainly starts to raise a red flag. I get to the check-in and the receptionist tells me the hotel does not have parking. But I'm welcome to park the car in one of the two lots surrounded by torn up chain link fences either across the street, or beside the hotel I think it was either 5 to 10 dollars, but no in and out privileges. Sounds weird, but I ask her where I can get some money to pay for the parking. She tells me there's an atm in that deli/automat where I saw the homeless guy, but by the afternoon, the atm is usually out of money. So my best bet is a bank a few blocks away. I ask her if my car will be ok outside, since I'll have to take my baggage up to the room to then go to the atm. She says don't worry at all, your car will be fine out there for the rest of the night if you like. So I take the elevator up to the room where I'm greeted by open doors on the hallways of shared bathrooms. They looked clean enough I suppose, but still, that's not what you want to be greeted with, multiple shared bathrooms--it really gave the feeling of a flophouse. I get to the room a door so flimsy it looks like it couldn't stop a light breeze from entering. The room was clean enough, but small with an en suite bathroom, the mattress was cheap and the room smelled like smoke. I guess this is one of the few hotels in LA that still has smoking... Anyway, there's no internet in the room despite the claim that there was wifi in the hotel, so having work to do for most of the night and internet being crucial, I decide combined with the smell of smoke and the general overall creepiness of the hotel, I can't stay there. I talk to orbitz about the situation, and they say the manager refuses to let me out of the reservation and will charge me for a night, despite the pretty much false advertising this place has given. That's when somebody asks if I'm the person with the rental car out front. I say yes, and they say, we were trying to get in touch with you because it was getting towed. I say, you're joking right? Nope, my car was towed. After 2 employees told me it would be ok. So now they agree to refund me my first night as well, but at this point I'm a tow ($150) and a ticket ($75) in the hole. So the only thing this manager can say is I'm sorry, then he kinda just acts like people do when they aren't really sorry they try and make themselves scarce. Not "how can we help make this up to you" or "what can we do to help," no, just "I'm sorry about that." To his credit he did find the number of the towing company for me so I could find out how much I was now in the hole thanks to their incompetence. While I'm at the desk by the way, the strangest cast of characters who stay there, or wanted to stay there came up. One guy was trying to decide whether paying 3 bucks more a night for a TV in his room was worth it. Flophouse. So after I regain my composure, I say you telling me you're "sorry" isn't enough. Don't you think the hotel should share some of the responsibility of having my car towed? His response was "no, if it's money you're looking for you won't get it, we already refunded you for the first night." Which was a joke since they really should have anyway considering how they advertised themselves. Finally I tell him this report is going to go on Trip Advisor and that's when he immediately changes his tune. Then he says he'll talk to management as see if they'll agree. I say, look just pay for half and show you're sharing some responsibility in this, and I'll feel much less anger toward your establishment which I thought was totally fair. I leave and after another hour of dealing with getting 250 bucks out of the bank and having a friend come by to help me find the towing pound, I was not a happy camper. The hotel cecil manager did call to say they agreed to cover half the towing. Not the ticket, ONLY the towing. So I think ok, I guess that's something and they're doing the honorable thing. We fax over the towing receipt as they asked us to do, and two months later, still no check. I assume it's not coming, which just proves how incompetent they are, bordering on just full-on scam artists, and dishonorable. Well, here's your trip advisor review Hotel Cecil. And I think I'm being kinder than anybody would be under the circumstances I was put in. Pros: Cheap Security Guards in Marble Lobby. Free wifi in Lobby area. Cons: Security Guards in Lobby. (They're there for a reason) Crackheads (I kid you not) stumbling down street in front of hotel as I wait for my friend to pick me up. No parking. Room/Hallways smelled like smoke. Incompetent staff. Summary: Saving a few bucks a night in this place is NOT worth the hassle. Not to mention the location is in the worst part of LA. If you want to experience the LA you've seen in the movies (unless you are attracted to the LA you saw in "Seven") stay anywhere else. This place is horrible. Period. I can't believe Orbitz would even offer this place as a package/hotel on their site.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.I have been a Marriott Gold member for ages as I travel frequently for business and have stayed at Marriotts all over the world. This past weekend my significant other and I decided to go to Paris for the weekend for a "just us" weekend before Christmas. I had stayed at this hotel before and found the location to be excellent and thought it a great way to use some of my Marriott points. A few things to note really: The location is excellent. The heating/air con is from 1970 and without a thermostat. It's a strange dial and button combo that's a bit of a guessing game. We never could get our room cool enough to sleep. I cannot speak to all other rooms but the wifi signal in 121 was so low it was unusable. A few other guests mentioned the same issue so it's worth your while to check the signal in the room before unpacking if you need internet access. The Concierge is awful. As noted on here by other reviewers the concierge service was unreliable. For a 5 star hotel this is simply unacceptable. Upon arriving on Friday night we requested the concierge book us a restaurant for Saturday night. He listed a few options from which we chose Le Duc a seafood restaurant and a time of 8:30pm. We also asked that he book us a taxi for 8pm to get to the restaurant. He told us he would call us to confirm the reservation and the taxi was no problem. By Saturday midday we still hadn't heard from him but were not concerned as we figured if he couldn't get us into Le Duc then surely wherever he did book would be just fine. Upon returning to the hotel we discovered that we had no reservation for dinner nor did we have a taxi booked. Shenanigans ensued and we did eventually get in but this was not the relaxing romantic experience we hoped for. Nor once did he apologize. If you go book your own tables and transport or risk it. By Sunday night it was clear that most of Europe was having travel delays so before we departed we checked with the concierge on the status of the Eurostar trains. True to form he gave us erroneous info and told us all trains were running on time. Now if the internet had worked in the room we would have known this was not at all true and plastered all over every travel site known to man. So after one very unnecessary trip to the train station we came back to the hotel and checked in for another night. There are worse things than being stuck in Paris or so we thought. That night we chose to eat in the hotel restaurant. One very big mistake. It certainly wasn't cheap being a 200 pound meal. The things we ate in common were the beef carpaccio and the escargot. We had different mains. By 4am were almost simultaneously and violently ill. It became fairly clear that we had food poisoning of some sort. Now these things do happen in the nicest of places. It only takes one food handling mistake for someone to become ill and to be honest at that point I was pretty willing to consider it bad luck but did feel the need to tell the general manager so they could at least examine any remaining beef carpaccio and escargot and one would imagine not serve it to other guests. I called in the morning and asked to speak to the general manager and was told he would call back. More than 4 hours later and still no one had returned my call. I called again expressing just how ill we had become and that I felt this was a safety issue for other guests that should at least be known about. 2 hours later I got a call a man who was the head of guest relations, not the general manager. His name was Fabian or Fabio. When I told him how ill we had become he told me that there was no way the food we ate could have caused it because they buy there food from quality vendors and the kitchen has been inspected. So clearly Fabian has not the most basic knowledge about food safety or food poisoning or he would know all it takes is someone using an unclean spoon to cause it. But really it was his next statement that outraged me. I was most likely ill he said because I am an American and I'm not used to fine French cuisine. Nothing like adding insult to injury. And this American happens to live in Europe and my significant other spent his entire childhood in France but thanks for the theory! He also told me he had had excellent reviews of the beef carpaccio. So nothing was done. For all I know the chef was never even told. We were too ill to even stand up long enough to take a shower so we were stuck at the hotel for another night. The pain and stomach cramps were getting to a point where we really did consider going to the hospital as it was clear we were going to need medication of some kind. In the meantime we ordered a bottle of water from room service and the room service waitress upon seeing our condition was appalled and asked if we would like for doctor to be called to the hotel. Bless this woman. It would have been fantastic if say Fabien had mentioned this option! 250 pounds later we had a doctor who confirmed yes this was food poisoning and a round of antibiotics among other things. In grand total our delay due to illness cost us nearly 1000 pounds for the extra night plus the doctor plus medication etc. The hotel never once called to check on us never once offered so much as a bottle of water. In fact when we asked for clean robes they were never brought up. The food poisoning has been so severe that now two days before Christmas we are still eating no more than crackers and water. Our relaxing weekend before Christmas is now threatening to ruin not only the weekend before but Christmas itself. The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. I have never given a 1 star review but blatant disregard for safety is inexcusable. Thankfully we are not old nor traveling with small children or this could have had a very different outcome. I'm sure in truth one big hotel chain to the next doesn't vary greatly but I have always been loyal to Marriott feeling it was a sure bet when away from home. Not any more. Buyer Beware! There are many wonderful hotel choices in Paris and right on the CE. There is no reason to give this one your patronage.Honeymoon from Hell Let me start out by saying when I was told about Secrets Excellence in Punta Cana on paper it sounded like the dreamvacation we always wanted for our honeymoon. Reality set in when we were there to the point we both started a mantra,  Excelente every time something went wrong, all the time wishing our honeymoon would be over.The Room - We arrived way past check in time but the room wasn't ready. Thedesk sent us to get lunch and assured us the room would be ready. Afterlunch the Maids were still not done-they were buffing the floors. Which lead my husband to the first trip to the front desk. Eventually we got in the room andit looked beautiful and since we had a balcony we stepped out on it to see the view we had requested so many months ago. We got a view of the service building with the help trekking in  out at all hours. The best thing I saw was the same individual spitting each day in front of our building. I went down to ask the desk if we could get a room with a view as we had initiallyasked to get. They explained that the really good rooms were only given to the Excellence Club to which we could not be a part of. It wasn't a question of extra money we would have paid; it was just a matter that there were no more people being accepted. So we dealt with that but being in the pool welearned a different truth. People were being upgraded without asking and without paying for it. I still don't know why we couldn't be a part of that club but I could deal with it if the room wasn't plagued with some other troubling factors - Ants/ power outages and the toilet not flushing and my husband having to physically stick his hand in the top half of the toilet to fix it.The Ring- My husband got his wedding ring stolen off his finger while we were getting a massage. He was not used to wearing a ring so hedidn't realize it was gone for a few hours. We went back to the spot on the beach where we got the massage. There we were confronted by two guards wielding shotguns.Scary - especially since we were trying to convey in broken Spanish that we had lost the ring. They allowed us to look and told us all stuff found would be turned into the concierge desk. the next morning my husband went to the conciergewho made a call to the lost and found. They told me they would call around-husband went back to the beach massage place where he watched the guy cleaning up search through the towels. He then went back to the concierge who acted likeit was the first time he told them this. He went down to the spa and continued down to the club. Concierge never followed up. It wasn'texpensive in price but it was in sentimentality.Room Service - We needed to set up breakfast in bed. We were told the onlytime available was 10:30am - It was late but we agreed to it. Next morning we wait and wait. Breakfast never comes. Eventually we get a call telling us that our breakfast will be coming. Husband called a half hour after that tofindout what was going on. They told me that it went out 5 min ago. We waste more time. Husband called back up to cancel. This lead him to yet another trip to the concierge.Meanwhile we are starved and need to wait another 1/2 hr for any restaurants to open for lunch. We are told to book again this time at 8am in the morning. It came on time but was disgusting. It looked as if they saved the meal from yesterday to serve itto us. We are physically ill after eating it. We continue to beill for the res of the trip.Dinner on the Beach. Husband couldn't eat it - not a bit of it- due to afore-mentioned room service incident. I was able to eat and got ill the next morning. I also got about 50 bug bites on each leg that kept her up at night even with bug spray on.Hospital trip - We were supposed to go on a catamaran excursion but couldn't because I had to run to the bathroom...many times...I looked pale and was dehydrated so husband called the resort doctor who I think is adoctor like Dr. Pepper is a doctor, sooo...Dr. Pepper called medical transport who brought me via wheelchair to medical services where Dr.Pepper shoved an IV in my wrist to replenish fluids, We traveled via ambulance to the Punta Canahospital half an hour away. We were told it was a 15 minute ride and wewould need to stay for about 2 hours. We stayed for 8 hours!!! I gave a blood and urine sample. Joyce was told that she probably had an intestinal parasite. The DR. told us that is what most people that come in have. If this is the case why doesn't the resort have medication on the premise totreat this condition?Clarification of this was never given because we never got the results of the test. That and no one could translate for us. We were brought upstairs where I was given antibiotics via the IV and something else that knockedme out. Nurses came in and out but no one ever asked if she was feeling better and we never saw the doctor again.When my husband asked if I could leave soon they called me animpatient Caucasian yet needed to get another patient to translate. Initially we were told that the transportation back to the resort is provided by the Excellence. This is not thecase. Around 7pm a nurse came in and handed us a bag of three differentdrugs and finally took the IV out. When we got outside the hospital I felt faint and nauseous and had to sit down on the curb. (Our cab left).We went back inside the hospital. But we left once I got her color back. When we got back homemy arm was infected from the IV.Prieto Tours-My husband went to them to explain to them why we didn't show up for the catamaran trip. He was told to show them proof. Couldn't he just call the concierge or the on resort doctor. I went up to my room and brought down the only paper we received from the hospital. Eventually they agreed togive me my money back but we lost more time.Conclusion - We will never ever go back to Punta Cana. We returned home more exhausted and more stressed than when I left. The things that were good about this place were so few and outnumbered by the bad. I think it might be one of the worst Honeymoons in history. I would never recommend thisdestination. I will just try to chalk it up as a very bad vacation andhopefully we will go on a real Honeymoon at a later date. I can't stressenough how bad it was.Didn't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

A shame, 'cos I'd really like to tell you how <profanity> awful this place was. The only praise I have for Seven Sands is for it's close proximity to The Mall of The Emirates. Where to begin: Firstly, upon arrival my wife and I weren't expected - they knew someone was coming, because they had a list saying expect some people... but until I produced my receipt they didn't know it was me. Secondly, I arrived from Saudi Arabia thinking this hotel would have bar facilities - that I could sit and have a quiet drink with my wife. I only found out as I was checking in that Seven Sands doesn't have a licence... and there is nowhere in close proximity that does. Marvelous. We checked in late in the night, around 11pm. The air-conditioner in our room wasn't working when we got there, so we called reception and they sent up a technician. After talking to the reception staff he informed us that the AC couldn’t be fixed tonight. Some bright spark suggested that my “pregnant” wife and I stay in this ‘hot-box’ for the night and be relocated the next day. Sorry, but I wasn’t forking out ‘peak season rates’ to sleep in a sauna – so suggested this wasn’t the smartest of ideas. 20 minutes later we were in our new room. The air-conditioner was working fine, but so many other problems cropped up: The tiling and decorations all look nice, but when you look close enough, it's easy for the un-trained eye to tell that the place has just been "thrown" together. The decor in the appartment was of the "budget" variety. The electronic appliances provided in our rooms all had two-pin plugs. The sockets in the walls are all three-pin. There were only two adapters in the whole apartment, so if we wanted to have a cup of coffee or make some toast, charge our cameras etc… we had to unplug some other appliance (the TV a lot) in order to do so. There are two wall-mounted flat-screen TV's: One in the lounge and one in the bedroom. Great, but all of the channels are free to air and the few english-language channels we did come across were scattered and difficult to find. We didn't come to Dubai to watch TV but the option for quality entertainment should be there - the owners of this place are charging a lot for a single night so should perhaps consider 'getting off their wallets' and providing some decent channels. The plug behind the lounge TV was too close to the set. Once the big lump of an adapter was in place, it was impossible to plug in anything else (satellite receiver, sterio). There was a second wall plug behind the tv, but this one had no power - and of course no adaptor. I un-plugged and re-plugged this tv and the decoder several times over the weekend as my wife and I went about charging our essentials or when making breakfast. The lamp in the lounge didn't work. I went to turn on the bedroom lamp only to find there wasn't even a plug at the end of the cable - Just two exposed wires. The phone in the bedroom was broken in the same way. Exposed wires and this time the plug still in the wall. There was no hair-dyer. The electronic safe was there as advertised – but of course wasn’t functioning. The door was open and the two steel rods that lock it once closed were permanently extended. There were no batteries installed. There was a leak from the bathroom toilet and the shower water was only just warm. we initially tolerated these – as we were getting sick of constantly reporting problems. On our second day, another leak started from the bathroom ceiling – the ceiling with grubby fingerprints all over it. We couldn’t ignore this so called for maintenance. Whatever the technician did, he not only fixed the leak - but provided us with hot water too. One of the few highlights of this place. The inside of the microwave was dirty. There was no electric jug in the kitchen, only the stand it sits on. We ran out of the small complementary coffee sachets so I visited reception and asked for a couple more. I watched one of the staff go into the kitchen to retrieve some. The receptionist sent me back to my room, and told me that they would be brought up shortly. I waited and waited and waited… and finally gave up hope... The next morning I helped myself to coffee sachets from the breakfast buffet. Speaking of breakfast – we only attempted it the once. That was enough. There was nobody to greet us, so had to find our own seating. It seemed that only one staff member was working the room and he was falling behind: Many of the tables were still occupied by used utensils - It was a struggle to find somewhere decent to sit. Strange really, because when you looked through the glass windows into the kitchen there seemed to be an awful lot of people in there. There were no suitable glasses to drink from - my wife had to pour her orange juice into a martini-style glass. In all my life, I have never seen anything like it!!! Even though food items were in warmers, they were still cold . The coffee I ordered came with powdered milk yet there was fresh milk available at the drink counter. I watched one woman pour herself a glass, take it back to her table then transfer it to her cup of coffee. She saw me looking and we exchanged one of those ‘can you believe this place!' looks. I couldn't believe that on this last holiday before our baby was born I had brought my wife into this rubbish!! My wife and I thought it would be less of a headache if we made our own breakfasts for the remaining two days of our stay – after all, we were staying in an “apartment” - so we brought supplies at the supermarket in the nearby Mall of The Emirates. Come the next morning when we sat down to eat, we found that there were no knives in the kitchen... forks and spoons yes, but no knives. We rifled thorough the cupboards looking for some but only succeeded in releasing some pretty awful smells Some furniture on the balcony would have been nice - people like to sit outside and have breakfast, dinner or sometimes drinks together. If you are crazy enough to check in - watch out for the step that’s just next to the reception area. Hard to see and a a bit of a health hazard!!! Not worth the money I paid for it!!!We are a couple that travelled from Scotland to this hell hole. We read on trip advisor the mixed reviews about it, but were willing to run the risk since we had already booked it as a last minute deal. For those of you know arent Scottish and know nothing about us, we dont suffer fools, especially when it interferes with our holiday. (More of that later on) When we arrived at the hotel, we had to wait at least 45 minutes to check in as the incompetent staff could not find our reservation, they took our documentation from us so they could find it, with great difficulty we got our documentation back. We were golf carted to our complex, number 2 right beside the beach. The room was clean enough and well air conditioned. We found out only when we checked in that we had to book to reserve a seat at one of the a la carte restaurants only to be told everything was fully booked, after a huge shouting match with the staff ( A Glasgow accent really works well on holiday) they magically found us 2 seats in the american food restaurant by the beach. We made reservations for many nights in advance to try all the other restaurants. We were not made aware of any dress code restrictions, we never thought there would be any, granted there would be on a cruise, but not in Mexico, lets face it its not exactly a mecca for the filthy rich and powerful. I was given a dirty look by the woman at the front of the restaurant who angrily ordered me to go away and change before I would be allowed in. We were unfortunate to have a hurricane whilst on holiday. Quite understandibly there had to be restrictions. But there was an extreme lack of communication from staff, we were ordered to stay in our rooms, we were given no compensation, i.e. perhaps allowing us to watch the pay per view movies for free to give us something to do, but nothing. It was only on this night that we found the buffet restaurant, we were not made aware of this on check in. Needless to say we never returned to the over pretentious restaurants. To say that the staff were rude is putting it mildly. I was disgusted by the way I was treated. The staff were rude when you asked them for pool service which the hotel gladly provided and you didnt ask them for an alcoholic drink, sometimes the drink didnt even arrive. I tend not to drink on holiday as I dont like mixing the heat and alcohol. The pool was harldy ever cleaned. The staff allowed crabs to wander into the pool. Staff done nothing to deter crabs from the resort. The mangrove that permeates the resort is stinking and full of rodents and vermin. The sea could not be swam in due to the disgusting seaweed which was never cleaned. We had a mexican woman come to our door and rattle off something in Spanish and then leave every day, to this day I still dont know what she wanted. Our room had to be changed due to the fan in our room being interfered with by the other rooms (they were all on radio sensors). Staff were very unhelpful and we had to move all our luggage ourselves. We decided to go to Playa del Carmen for the day on a few occasions but were ripped off by the changing cab fairs. The entertainment at this resort which is literally out in the middle of nowhere is abismal. It does not cater for English speaking peoples. They ripped off the Lion King by putting their own amateur show on. The entertainment was mainly aimed at children and did not cater for adults whatsoever. We often found ourselves sitting in our rooms by 8pm on most nights trying to find a TV channel that we could understand. The pieste de resistance came when we were cornered by one of the concierges to take out a timeshare. Now we were promised $100 dollars to spend in the resort if we just went and listened to the presentation which we thought was fair enough. So on the morning of the presentation BBGE really showed how good they were by giving us a golf cart to travel all of 100 yards to the presentation. We were shown around the VIP rooms (which were littered with dead crabs) and areas of the resort (which we were already using having not paid any VIP money), given in depth knowledge of how our finances could afford this and how we could use it in places around the world. After he finally finished his talk which lasted an hour we told him we were not interested. At this he got very angry and called his manager over who blasted us for wasting their time. (Read the condition of why we attended) When we fought our way out we were shown the servants exit of the building having had the red carpet treatment on the way in. We were then told we were not getting our money. We fought again for it and won our case (again with the Glasgow accents). We spent our money in the spa which was very good. I should mention here that we also fought for compensation when changing rooms. This allowed us to get some nice massages. Basically the moral of the story is if you want to go on a holiday where you are prepared to fight the ignorant Mexican people for decent 2 star service then go here. If you want to fight for what can only be described as an absolute disgrace and they have a cheek to even give it anything above 2 stars then go here. We were very fortunate going here, we were not ripped off, but I feel so sorry for those who were, especially in the past year where the rip offs seems to have gotten worse. Stay away from this place. Its seedy, its dangerous dont trust it. Save your money, especially if travelling from Europe. P.S. Bird droppings on your plate at breakfast is never a good way to start the day. Stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I wish I had read more hotel reviews before booking this hotel! I don't consider myself to be a picky traveler and I consider the hotel, just a place to stay when you are not out having fun. I tried to ignore the short falls of the hotel but in the end there were just way too many!! We arrived late at night on Feb. 20th. They put us in a corner room in building five and everything seemed great. As we start unpacking (11:30 pm) we notice that we are in a 3 bedroom 2 bath instead of a 3 bedroom, 3 bath. We called downstairs to find out what was going on and then found out that they had no 3 bedroom 3 baths open, and that we would have to wait until the next day after checkout (9am - 11am) to move. I couldn't believe they wouldn't have told us that at the desk when we checked in???!!!! They just put us in the wrong room and acted like nothing was wrong. So the next morning we had to then repack everything and delay our kids from going to Disney. We hung out in the lobby for an hour waiting for word on our room. Finally at 11 they told us to go to Disney and that they would move our belongings to our new room and everything would be ready when we came back. Lie #2 Nothing had been done when we returned back to the hotel. We had to move all of our things to tower one, a dirty room overlooking the parking lot of the Factory outlet. Lie #3 They then told us how sorry they were and that they would comp our room the first night. (Read Below - this was another lie) Lie#3 My husband was in Orlando on business and had to have the internet. He called the hotel ahead of time to make sure they had wifi. Needless to say, we were never able to get any internet connection in our room. He went out and purchased a cable and we were still never able to get any access. The hotel then lied again to say usually they do have access but it was down. When we finally moved into our room in tower one at 9:30 pm my young kids were worn out and ready for bed. We went to make up the couch bed only to find the sheets were the wrong size. We called to get sheets and they told us they would be right up(Lie #4). 35 minutes later still no sheets. I had to get dressed and go down to the lobby to get them to send sheets up to our room. We wore flip flops in our room because it was so dirty. We stopped using the kitchen because there were small spider looking bugs everywhere. We didn't notice them at first, but they got into our cereal boxes. So we threw everything away and ate at Dunkin Donuts for breakfast and the Irish pub for dinner. The burger there was delicious! We spent no time out on our balcony because it overlooked a parking lot - very disappointing. The kids did enjoy getting in the tubs in the bathroom every night and relaxing after a long day in the parks. My kids complained a few times that they had bites behind their knees and underarms. I ignored it thinking maybe mosquitoes. After reading reviews since I returned from my trip I see many people have complained about bed bugs. I am wincing in disgust hoping that I did not bring any home with me. If I did there will be a major PROBLEM! The swimming pool was great. The kids loved the slide and the hot tubs were very relaxing. The life guard had to leave the slide closed several times to constantly get more towels, that was kind a bummer for my boys. Also, plan well, because as the sun goes down the pool is shaded and cold. They told us they were not going to charge us for the first night. At checkout they then told my husband they were not going to charge us for two nights because of the problems with the room and internet. Upon getting our bill we noticed that they only discounted our bill for the resort fee for two nights - that's 20 dollars. Careful with the taxi drivers at the hotel they wanted to charge us 30 dollars to bring us to the parks and 65 to the airport. Sadly we paid that not knowing we could get it a lot cheaper. Shame on them for taking advantage and shame on the hotel for letting them. We rented a van so my husband could get back and forth to his class. Parking was very limited and sometimes you just had to park on the road or park far away from your tower. In conclusion ( after reading reviews about this hotel for the last year) it seems like the hotel is going downhill rapidly!!! There may still be some good rooms left in the newer towers. If you are staying here you may want to contact those people who wrote good reviews and ask what their room number was. I was in building one on the 7th floor - I would stay away from this whole tower! Good Luck If my bill is not resolved I am considering reporting this hotel to the better business bureau. I am definitely following up on the bed bug investigation someone mentioned in their post.because the waiters need SEVERE ATTITUE ADJUSTMENTS.Unfortunately, we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the South St Seaport.the most horrible 24 hours of my life This has been my first and last trip to the Dominican Republic. We arrived at the airport, and were very vaguely pointed in the direction of the bus that would take us to the hotel. We waited at least 20-30 min for the bus to leave. The driver was horrible, and actually hit a palm tree when trying to back out of a small space by one of the other resorts. We finally arrived at the hotel only to wait in a check in line for 30 min. Not even the beginning of the issues! We were told to come back at 3pm, almost an hour later. We got a pina colada at the bar, which contained little if no alcohol, and sat on stained seats in the un-airconditioned lobby while waiting. At 10 to 3pm, we got on line. Perhaps 5 people were in front of us. We waited a total of nearly 3 hours to get a room!! Numerous people cut in front of us, many were served only because they spoke spanish. Staff was actually laughing at our desperation, apparently finding their poor accomadations amusing. We were told to come back in 15 min, but us along with other guests were demanding rooms right away. Eventually, we were given a room and headed to the bellboy to tell him the room number, but to please wait because we had to wait on another line for a room safe. After another 15 min, and a couple attempting to cut in front of us that we prevented, we got the safe key and headed outside to let the bell boy know we were ready for him to bring the luggage. To our horror, our luggage had disappeared! we ran to our room, and of course it wasn't there. we attempted to ask a maid for help, but she spoke no english, and really had no idea what was going on. eventually we found the bell boy, who had moved the luggage without permission, and ripped our bags off the cart and took them to our rooms ourselves. but even more fun was yet to come! we asked for 2 double beds, and instead got one king size. the toilet was leaking, the floor had mold in between the tiles, the bathtub had black/grey colored dirt on the floor, there were stains of human origin on our blanket, and bugs on the fruit basket and comfortor.the water was undrinkable, and for 4 stars, should surely have been purified. instead, we were forced to lug water bottles back to our room. the beach was less than spectacular. tons of seaweed and cloudy water. pool was no better, it closes at 7pm and was cloudy also. we had nothing to do the entire night. most bars close between 5pm - 7pm, the lastest is 1am. if you're hungry after the buffet closes at 10:30pm, too bad. you're eating nothing. the food at the buffet was actually very decent, and was about the only thing we enjoyed, however tiny bugs were on the table cloth and had to be killed during the meal. until after 9pm, all of our drinks were served in very small plastic cups. this is 4 star service? the only beer available was presidente, which we both dislike. the staff is rude, unfriendly, and barely acknowledge you're presence. don't ask any questions, b/c they probably won't be answering you. or you may be waiting hours until they do. nightlife is non existent. entertainment consists of a jennifer lopez impersonator singing poorly, and the rest is in spanish. the whole thing reminded me of a retirement village. as two young women in our early 20's, we found literally nobody our age in the entire complex. mostly couples with young children. NOT what we expected at all, and completely undesirable. after much deliberation, we decided the trip was so doomed and miserable at this hell hole that we contacted our travel agent and booked a flight out of there the very next day. the manager offered us a new room after we complained the following morning, while sending maids to tend to our room. to our horror, upon arriving back to our room to pick up our luggage a few minutes later, i found important paperwork i had left out thrown away (i hadn't expected anyone in my room or throwing anything away that wasn't clearly in the garbage), and the same filthy blankets were left on our bed!!! we hadn't slept in it the night before (we were reduced to sleeping on straw chairs rather then face the squalor of the beds or any bugs that may have been in it) but goes to show you how often things are changed! same stains in the same spot!! only one person out of the entire staff was polite and helpful, and arranged for a taxi to take us back to the airport. (we were unable to take the bus that we had paid for in the all inclusive package being that it stops at at least 5 other hotels and we would have missed our flight). If you don't mind squalor, appaling customer service, rude staff, bug infested rooms, and being unable to shower your entire stay, then this is absolutely the choice for you. If not, think twice. This is truly hell on earth.Never again, Meli谩 This document intends to describe our experience in one of Meli谩鈥檚 all-inclusive resorts during our one-week stay in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.I must start by saying that we were booked into a 6:40 am flight that arrived at Punta Cana two hours later, having to be at MIA airport 3 hours prior to our departure. In another words, some of us were up since 3:00 o鈥檆lock that morning, some others preferred not to sleep at all that night.The welcoming at Punta Cana Int鈥檒 Airport was great We were greeted with a group of locals playing their traditional music, and the airport personnel was courteous and helpful. The twenty-minute bumpy trip to the resort, which gave us a chance to glance through the countryside, and the treatment received from the tour company handling the trip, was not bad. But all this went sour upon our arrival at Punta Cana鈥檚 Meli谩 Caribe Tropical.As you arrive to the reception desk, and meet with one of their front desk representatives, you immediately become sickened with their arrogance, as it appears that speaking more than one language, and having a slightly higher degree of intellectuality than the rest of the employees, gives them a sense of superiority. Most of the directions given to the guests by these people as far as locations and transportation are inaccurate, and by just standing there in the reception area, you easily identify their incompetence and lack of interest.A minor detail forgotten to be mentioned to us by our travel agent was that Punta Cana鈥檚 Meli谩 Caribe Tropical鈥檚 normal operation is based on overbooking, and that check-in time is AFTER 3:00pm. Notice that after 3:00pm could be any time from 3:00pm to not having a room at all, like it happened to a young couple that we met later on, who were transferred to the Golf Suites because there were no rooms available in the Caribe Tropical at their arrival.We were a little more fortunate to have a room ready by 4:30pm, although we were offered all the privileges of the resort upon check-in. But who wants to make use of privileges after spending an entire night without sleep? We wanted to rest for a few hours as we had planned, and later make use of the pool and other hotel amenities. Out of exhaustion, we all crashed into some chairs located in the reception area, as our three-year-old daughter also fell asleep in a 98-degree heat index temperature, because no, there is no air conditioning anywhere but in certain night restaurants and in the hotel rooms. We were there from the time we arrived to the hotel until the time we got our room key, which was approximately six hours, while one of the hallway sharks that tries to ironically sell you a 鈥渕embership鈥?got a piece of our mind.When we were finally given the key to our room, this train/tram-like transportation bus that passes every 15 minutes (try 30-45) took us to the stop closest to our destination. It was at that point that we became aware that our room had been ready for hours, and as one of the maids told us, our room was the first one to be ready that morning.The rooms aren鈥檛 bad, there are 12 rooms back-to-back in each two-story villa surrounded by a breathtaking landscape, but none of them had running water at our arrival. There were no towels either, because towels seem to be a luxury that you don鈥檛 necessarily get entitled to everyday. Later on during the week, we learned that the hot water heater gets turned off at approximately 10:00pm and doesn鈥檛 come on 鈥榯ill next afternoon. One day after coming back late from a tour, we called the front desk and inquired about this problem. The person who answered the phone the first time asked us to have the hot water running for a long while, that 鈥渆ventually it will get hot鈥? The second time we called, we requested a maintenance guy, who surprisingly showed up, but he said that the repair had to wait 鈥榯ill the next day.With the exception of most restaurant personnel and cleaning crews, the attention you get is deplorable. The first three nights of our stay it rained. The train-bus was the only mean of transportation between villas and restaurants because the long and slippery stamped concrete roads had flooded due to poor design and lack of maintenance. At the arrival to the stop, the train came with the plastic covers that prevent passengers from getting wet rolled up. These covers are permanently attached, and can easily be rolled down to keep seats and passengers dry. But why would the driver get wet, we said, if the poor man isn鈥檛 even provided with a raincoat? We were all formally dressed as required by these over-rated reservation restaurants, and needless to say, we had to let the train go in hopes that as it would get to the Tropical covered station, the driver would have a chance to bring these covers down, and maybe dry the seats. 35 minutes later, the train was back the same way it had left when we let it go the first time. We gave-up on our reservation for that night and decided on waiting 鈥榯ill the rain stopped to eat in one of the many other fly-infested restaurants of the Meli谩 Caribe Tropical resort.This is not fiction, and I sincerely hope that Mr. Manfred reads the complaint we filed with Mr. Eduardo Garcia, head of customer service, where we denounced all these irregularities in addition to the decomposed lobster served to us at the Capri restaurant.We had read posted complaints like this one about Meli谩 Caribe Tropical resort, but with all honesty, it was just too much to be considered credible. On the other hand, there were other reviews from people that had enjoyed themselves intensely, and had mentioned the fun they had with all these 鈥渨ater sports鈥?and 鈥渉orseback riding鈥?activities that sounded really contradicting. We just had to witness it ourselves and share it with other guests that we also met during our stay to make our own conclusions. By the way, no discounts on water sports for being a hotel guest. If you want an hour of jet ski, prepare to pay US $120.00.The question of why would any institution put its name behind (and in this case in front) of such a messed-up operation like this one, and allow these stories to spread out without an apparent effort of correction still remains.I must not end this review without thanking the Tripadvisor site for allowing all of us to make public our independent and unbiased opinions.$ 1 4 . 0 0 .....A.....G A L L O N....?.WITH SHIPPING, (AND HANDLING!), THE COST OF THIS ARROWHEAD DISTILLED WATER COMES TO $14.005 PER GALLON!  This price is even hard for luxury-loving me to swallow!  Especially as there is a way to make distilled water, (even without a water-distiller!) for just about no cost at all!<br /><br />Please note that I am NOT here singling out Arrowhead Distilled water as being over-priced.  It just happened to come up first on the list of ready-made distilled water, here at Amazon.  I'm sure that it, (and all the other ready-made distilled waters being sold), is tasty and healthy, (and convenient!) distilled water.  However, it is WOEFULLY OVER-PRICED.  My review here is for ALL ready-to-drink, distilled waters, offered on Amazon, (and elsewhere), at such ridiculous prices.<br /><br />HOW can one make distilled water far more cheaply -- and without a<br />water-distiller?  By employing a method known as "home-distillation".<br />(This has NOTHING whatsoever to do with home distillation of whisky, of course.  It is for home-distillation of WATER.  Nothing illegal here, (yet, anyway!)  Copper kettles, copper coils, and new-made cornmash are NOT required, or used here!<br /><br />What IS used?  Large, (gallon size, if possible), glass jars.  The type in which organic apple juice often is seen.  What to do:  After washing out the bottle thoroughly, (and or, after previously drinking up all of the delicious organic apple juice), rinse jar throughly, to be sure no soap is left in the jar.  Rinse first with hot water, then, very slowly, (so as not to have an abrupt temperature change that can crack the glass), decrease the amount of hot water, and increase the amount of cold water used to rinse out the jar.  When 100% cold water is flowing from the faucet into the jar, keep rinsing<br />jar for another minute.  Finally, empty the jar, and fill with 100% cold(est) water.  Lightly cover with a PLASTIC cap, as metal caps tend to get rusty after a while.  (I find that different top colours from gallon-sized jugs of milk are perfect for this: gradually build up a collection of red, orange, green, white, and other colour milk-gallon tops, from whole, nonfat, and other types of milk.  Caps from bottles of products such as ENSURE, and PEDIA-SURE, are also good for<br />lightly covering these gallon milk containers, filled now as they are with home-distilled-water-in-the-making.)<br /><br />Fill up as many of these empty gallon glass containers as you can, (and for which you have room on your kitchen counter, or elsewhere), waiting at least an hour before you fill each jug in sequence, using a different colour top for each one.<br /><br />Get some magnets, and place them in a handy place -- like on your refrigerator door.  Take some small pieces of paper, and write the colour of each top/cover, on them.  Attach the pieces of paper to your refrigerator door, (or other handy place).  Line the pieces of paper up in a row, with the colour of the cover of the first jug you fill first, the colour of the colour of the top of the second jug you fill second, and so on.<br /><br />Now, just wait at least 10 hours from the time you fill the first jug.  When you want some distilled water, simply pour it into the saucepan / goldfish bowl, or wherever else you want to use your home-distilled water.  DO NOT USE MORE THAN HALF OF THE CONTENTS OF EACH JAR!  The secret of home-distilled water, you see, is that all of the flouride, and other things that are put into tap water, that you do not want, (and are the reason you buy or make distilled water in the first place), will, during the 10 or more hours you are waiting, sink down to the bottom of the bottle, as they are heavier than the water!<br />I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU BOIL THE WATER IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU HAVE DISTILLED IT, HOWEVER -- AT LEAST TWO FULL MINUTES ON A FULL BOIL.  BECAUSE "STANDING WATER" CAN GET STALE, (AND PROBABLY DANGEROUS), IF YOU LEAVE IT OUT TOO LONG WITHOUT REFRIGERATION.)  Of course, if you have a HUGE refrigerator, you can probably put the distilled water into it immediately after filling the jugs, and reduce, or eliminate, the boiling time otherwise required.  If you must boil the water, and want COOL distilled water, just turn the gas or electric stove off after the required two minutes, and wait until the water has cooled.<br /><br />When you finish using the first bottle of distilled water, rinse it out again with hot, then ever-so-slowly, cooler -- then cold water.<br />Move the paper attached to the refrigerator with the magnet, signifying the first bottle, (say, with the word "blue" on the paper -- signifying that the first bottle has a blue cap on it), to the end of the row.  Now, take the paper attached by a magnet signifying the second bottle, (say, with the word "yellow" written on it, meaning the yellow-capped bottle), to the "head of the line" of pieces of paper attached by magnets, on your refrigerator.  And so on.  This way, you need only move the papers attached by magnets, on your refrigerator, and not the bottles themselves, to always know which bottle has been sitting out the longest, (and hence has the most distillation at the moment.)  Lifting these little papers-attached-by-magnets-to-the-refrigerator, and moving them around, to different places in the line on your refrigerator, is a whole lot easier than always lifting, and repositioning the gallon-size glass jars on your kitchen counter!<br /><br />In any event, you will now have pure, home-distilled water!  The longer you let the water remain in the jugs, the more distilled the water will be.  The less you take out of each jug, the more distilled the water will be.<br /><br />NOTE: DISTILLING WATER, BY ANY METHOD, WILL ALSO ELIMINATE NEEDED MINERALS FROM THE WATER.  Because minerals -- along with flouride and other contaminates your well-meaning city water system puts into city water -- are also heavier than the water.  SO, IF YOU DRINK DISTILLED WATER, FROM ANY SOURCE, BE SURE TO ALSO TAKE MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS!<br /><br />This SOUNDS like a very, very complicated process -- but read it a few times, and you will see how actually very, very simple it is.  You get another bonus when boiling the distilled water -- it takes LESS TIME TO BOIL, AND WILL BOIL MORE THROUGHLY, because the floride, minerals, and other things have been removed from the water.  It's like the difference between boiling water that has pebbles in it, and water that doesn't have pebbles in it.  Because these "extra-aqualar" particles -- minerals, flouride, etc. -- are just that: tiny, microscopic "pebbles".<br /><br />Line up as many gallon jugs as you can find and have room for, (I have 8).  Have fun and save money with your home-distilled water.  It will cost ONLY the price of your water-bill!I often find myself with time to kill in Times Square, which is a shame since I don't love this area.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.I stayed 5 nights at the Axel hotel in Berlin – this is enough time not only to get a real good feel for a place, but it also to see how things are done and maintained (or in this case, not). From the very beginning I experienced the poor level of maintenance at the hotel and overall my stay was a resounding disappointment. Check-in: I was informed that my “unchangeable & non-cancellable” pre-paid reservation was in fact not pre-paid, because, and I quote:, "what our website says and does is two different things". So Axel's administrative procedures are misleading and not clear. And of course it gets worse, much worse. Standard room: Extremely small and not cheap. Don’t even think about renting this type of room if you are 2 persons, because even with only one suitcase, you could hardly move around the room. Junior suite: I later moved to a junior suite and while this type of room is larger, if you happen to be 2 people, only 1 person can sit down as there is only one chair (again, this is in a junior suite). Other: The hotel's TV system does not work properly at all. At the gym/spa area, the training equipment is not in good order and make so much noise that it disturbs the other guests. The air conditioning system in the hotel simply did NOT work. This is important, as you cannot really open the windows and the hotel is located on a busy street. The Spa area in general is not well maintained at all. The air is poor and the only air duct present in the gym is so dirty and completely filled with dust and grime that it is probably a breeding ground for mould and mildew and who knows what other air borne bacteria! See attached picture. And this in an area where you are supposed to be breathing heavily and exercising. The whole SPA floor area was covered in cold water (uncomfortable, very slippery and dangerous). The hot sauna was not hot at all and the steam sauna was so cold that nobody stayed in it. The outdoor Jacuzzi was also very cold and made staying outside impossible as well. This is without a doubt, the worst spa area of any hotel I have ever been in. Very very disappointing, especially if you consider the type of clientele are trying to appeal to. Room service: Ineffective & rude. I had to order some ice as there were no ice machines on any of the floors (this is 2011 by the way…). After waiting for over 30 minutes, I decided to go down and get it myself. I was informed by a very rude waiter that he had been to my room 3 times (obviously he had gone to the wrong room). To penalize ME, he adds: “normally the ice is free, but because I had to go upstairs 3 times, I am going to charge you 4.50 Euros for the ice. Nice “on the fly” policy making and flexible pricing if you ask me. Housekeeping: Highly inefficient and disorganized. Two days in a row, after leaving the "clean room" sign on our door at 9am, it was still not clean when we returned to the hotel at 5pm!!!. I had to move the bed slightly because I dropped something behind it - the walls behind the bed where stained and dirty and the floor was full of dust (see picture). There were also some very nasty (and very visible) stains on the bedcover = gross (see pic). The carpets in the hallways were dirty. When returning to my room one day, I found a letter and a fax on my desk that was not even addressed to me. A member of staff had left confidential correspondence addressed to the hotel on the desk of a hotel guest. Nice move. There was also a break and large cracks in a large mirror that no one thought was necessary to fix or replace. I was so frustrated by my stay at this hotel that I asked to speak with the hotel manager. I was informed that he was not in, but given his business card. I then took the time to write Mr. Olivier Boehme a detailed complaint and recommendation letter that was sent on the 10th of July. I specifically asked him to get back to me with his reactions and reply. It is now the 16th of August – so more than a month later and he didn’t even have the professionalism or decency to respond. Hence that is the reason I have decided to make this review public on Trip Advisor. I believe Axel hotels could have been on to something with the positioning of their chain, but frankly, it appears more like they are trying to take advantage of a clientele that they consider won over in advance and not worth working too hard for. What they fail to recognize is that this is also a well travelled and demanding clientele. If you want better value and much better service, stay at the Hilton, Marriott or any other place for that matter – no doubt you will also be encouraging a lot of the LGTA community who happen to be working in those places too.You don't want to go there! Me and my husband as well as a couple of friends stayed at the Edenh May 4-10 2008 and none of us liked it. It was our third time to the D.R, second to Punta Cana. We stayed and the Riu Bachata and Riu Palace Macao before and we loved it. The RoomsFirst of all the hotel is beautiful, everything is new and clean. However we paid extra for the V.I.P package and should have got an ocean view room. What we got was the room on the main floor overlooking the pool and the umbrellas (ocan not in sight). Not only that, the balkony was open and our jacuzzi was right by the public walkway so we couldn't even take a romantic bath together without people walking by all the time. The washroom is open with the bedroom so if you have stomach problems trust me, it's heard and smelled all over the room. Our fruit basket consisted of a few small peaces of fruit, not enough for one child to satisfy. We had to fight with the management to give us a better room (which they eventually did) since after all we paid $700.00 extra. But still the bathroom was only halfway closed, you could still smell everything, ehhh.The entertainment There was almost no games or entertainment by the pool. It was so quiet all the time and boring. It wasn't until the end when they started playing some music. I didn't see the animacion people until the end, they don't really try hard there. The evening entertainment sucked, I mean really. There was one good show with professional dancers other shows consisted of some lame singers and O!! They played you movies on a big screen instead of shows in the evening. Like we don't have movies here or in our room?The staffI was suprised that the staff wasn't that friendly. Some were but being in the D.R the third time we expected more. The pool bars don't open until 11:00. One time me and my girlfriend went to the beach and she wasn't feeling that well and wanted some water because she thought that she might faint. We went to the pool bar and the guy told us to wait 15 min because they're not open yet. So we sat down and waited. 15 min later we came up to him again and he told us to wait 10 more minutes. I said Look we just want some water because my friend is not feeling well and it's quite a walk to the lobby. He told me I don't care So then I went to the V.I.P bar which luckly was open and got some water but I came back to the other bar to get this rude guy's name so I could report him. I didn't even say anything to him I just came up to look at his name tag and he sad to me in a rude manner What?!! When I spoke to the manager he wasn't too concerned, the girl at the front desk was actually laughing when I told her about the incident. How rude....... All the pool bars also close by 6:00 pm when its still sunny outside but the place is already dead because when there is nothing to drink people just go back to their rooms and leave the pool. The Food Horrible!! I am really not kidding. We've been to Jamaica, Cuba, and twice to the Dominican Republic before and never did we complain about food. Everywhere you go you will always have things you like and things you don't like but at the Edenh all of us didn't like anything. There is very little fruit in there, no friut at lunch at the pool restaurant, very little fruit at dinner, maybe some bannanas, pinapple and watermelon. that's about it. And they don't refill it too often so even if it is available, people take it and the plates will be emptly for an hour or so until the refill it. The food is very repetitive, not many choices but it's still better than the a la carte. OMG! I just can't explain it, I don't know where they got their cook from but they need to get rid of him. By the way even though they have a few a la carte, only one or two is open a night the rest is closed. You can't make reservations before so you end up standing in a line up (sometimes up to 1 hour) to make reservation or get a table. Not only that, every time, EVERY TIME we went to the a la carte (whichever one) we waited about 1-1.5 hours for the food. So when we stood in the line up at 7:00 pm for the restaurant, we don't get in until about 8:00 pm or past that and the food would usually arrive an hour or more after we sat down so we didn't eat until 9:00-9:30. There was four of us and all of us had stomach problems. But it wasn't just a bit of diarrhea that you usually get for the first couple of days just because the food there different. I was prepared for that. However, we were all violently sick; vomiting, diarrhea all the time, stomach cramps etc. day and night. All four of us spent the week hungry because we just could not keep down the food. Now for all of us it was the first time we got sick like that. Like I mentioned before, we love to travel to the D.R it is our favorite place and we always loved the food there!! But in the Edenh......I wouldn't touch it with a 2 m stick. I will just tell you this: If you have low expectations you will be ok there. However this place is too expensive for what it is worth. It looks like a 5 star but it operates on a 2 star level. We are not pessimists and never did we complain about any vacation until now. This place is going to fall really fast unless they change the management because it could have been an excellent resort if they tried harder. However, you can feel and see that they don't really care about people being happy there. There are so many better places to go to in Punta Cana. And if you do decide to go there, don't take the V.I.P package, it is really now worth it. the alcohol is the same (they're usually out of the brands at the VIP) to room is the same except it has a half-closed bathroom instead of all open one, and NO, you don't get to have better restaurants. All you have is a designated section in each restaurant for the VIP which looks the same and has the same service, so don't pay more, its' not worth it!Likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then Nick and Joe's may not be your favorite.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

At that time I would have given it a Very Good, even Excellent when compared to other OC hotels which have a reputation for being a little trashy. We loved the 2 room King suites, which at the time were very new, the tile floors, the location on the boardwalk and the space in each room. It was great! WAS being the operative word. This past visit would have made our 6th visit and the change over the years has not been welcome. Let's start with our arrival. It began much like all the others, we arrive mid-morning. We go to the check-in desk, the room isn't ready (of course, we wouldn't expect it to be at 10:30 since check in isn't really until 3pm) but we pay our balance and they provide us a parking pass. Also, as they have done in past visits, they take my cell phone number and promise to call when it is ready. I see her write my number down, next to our future room number 221. Normally, we would have stayed on the beach until we were called but this particular visit an afternoon thunderstorm had us taking cover around 2:30. I thought as long as we had packed it up I may as well check on the room status. Still before official check in time though I wasn't suprised that it wasn't ready but the person at the front desk said it shouldn't be much longer and double checked that they had my phone number. My son and his friend went to the pool while my husband and I hung in the car--no sense in going to far since it would be ready soon right? It was nearly 4pm when I walked back into the lobby to see if they had forgotten to call me, an hour after check in time. "I'm sorry , you're room isn't ready yet but I just spoke to housekeeping and they were doing your floors. It should only be another 10 minutes". At this point I decide to head to the pool bar and drown my annoyance. On the way to the bar and walked by our room which happened to be on the same floor. What I gathered from dawdling out in the hallway was that housekeeping was just starting the room. I went to the bar and at 5pm still hadn't received a phone call. Housekeeping was no longer in the hallway so I headed downstairs to the desk where I found a totally different set of receptionists. I doubt I ever would have received a call and yes, the room was ready and delivered to me 2 hours late. Really, the 5pm wouldn't even be a big deal except that I misled twice. Be honest with me, don't lie to get me out of your face. I could have better spent the time hanging on the boardwalk. Oh and while visiting the pool bar I noticed that the soap in the bathroom was empty, twice. So where are their employees washing their hands exactly? We had a 2 room King suite again. This was the 4th time with this room type. The other two times were in the Ocean view 1King room. Each visit I noticed things that needed sprucing. This time there were things in serious disrepair. I started with my usual bedbug check. This is something I do in EVERY hotel, 5 star or 1 star, bedbugs don't discriminate. However I was far more thorough this time after a very recent reviewer was bitten by and had managment confirm they had bedbugs. I actually took the time to contact this reviewer and she stated that the managments response was to give them black oversized trashbags to put their belongings in and told them not to take them in their house. So instead of giving a quick check of the corners of the mattess and box springs I stripped both of the beds completely. I did not find any evidence of bedbugs (but that doesn't mean you shouldn't check or that they weren't there). One of the mattesses was in absolutely terrible repair. The tape that locks the seams of the mattess had completely come undone and you could see into the springs of the mattress. In general I'd say they were old or of very very poor quality as neither my husband slept well. The teenagers were OK but then they could sleep upside down on a rock. The sheets were worn and frayed in places and one sheet was yellowed it was so old. Not that it was easy to see in the second windowless room where there was only one pitiful floor lamp. I had to do that inspection by the light on my camera phone. Other notable issues: the safe seemed to be malfunctioning, the toilet was not properly leveled and rocked every time I sat down (and then ran so the rocking may have been causing leaking as well), there was no tv remote in the main bedroom and the second bedroom had a remote but it wasn't functional. Oh and the floor that they had been cleaning when I was denied check in, wasn't really all that clean. There was still lots of sand particularly in the corners. The bathroom shower stall was dirty looking on the floor and the prior guest had left their scrubby hanging in the shower which housekeeping also missed. Makes me wonder if they did anything more than restock the towels and toiletries which there were enough of. And yes, if you thinking I'm being overly picky, I probably am but since it was their reason to deny our checkin for two hours then I'm feeling rather justified. I will say the paint looked fresher than it had been the last time we were there two years ago. The rest of our stay involved little interaction with the staff. We had them "clean" the room after our second night. They did replace dirty towels but I have my doubts as to whether the bedsheets were replaced after I found what looked like the same yellow top sheet on our bed. Check out the same person who happily took my money and then lied about the amount of time the room would be ready in took my keys. Didn't bother to ask about my stay. Of course maybe she didn't care. Who knows? One thing I did notice as we were loading the car up, two women standing in the lobby with their belongings in oversized black plastic trash bags. None of us experienced any bites but our belongings are in my hot car, in a trash bag, hopefully frying any covert hitchhikers. This hotel either needs to take better care of their facilites and their guests or lower their price point. The location is the only thing it has going for it anymore and even that isn't worth the rest of the experience.The Management was less than accomodating.I am from Pennsylvania and recently stayed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk Resort in Daytona Beach Florida. This was my first time to Daytona Beach and an easy 20 years since I had a “real” getaway vacation. My girlfriend and I started off having a great time until our UPSCALE RESORT ROOM WAS BURGLARIZED. I would like to share my experience with you so you can make your own decision as to whether or not you want to risk having a similar experience yourself at this resort. We arrived at the Wyndham Ocean Walk Resort on September 1, 2009, around 4:00pm. We had no trouble checking in as some people have stated, however, it was only a Tuesday. We then began our vacation by enjoying the resort facilities, the beach, many local establishments, sightseeing, and of course the Daytona 500 Speedway Experience Tour…this was a BIG highlight of my vacation. So far I had taken about 500 pictures during the first 48 hours of our trip. On Thursday, September 3, 2009, we enjoyed a great meal and perfect service at the Outback Steakhouse. We returned to our room, #1406, around 8:30pm…. Keep in mind we were only gone for about 2 hours! Upon entering our room, I noticed the bathroom light was on (I turned “everything” off when we left). As I entered the bedroom I soon discovered my camera bag and equipment were missing (value of contents $2400.00)….. I further searched our room and noticed the balcony door looked slightly open… I grabbed the door and it opened right up. The lock was in the locked position, but due to a malfunctioning door, it did not catch the hook inside the door jam and allowed the door to be opened from the outside. Also stolen were prescription medication, cash, and our dresser drawers were gone through. The rooms on either side of us were not in use, so how could someone possibly enter a balcony door on the 14th floor? I immediately contacted the resort manager, security, and the Daytona Beach PD. A lock interrogation (which electronically reads all recorded entries through only the main door of the room) was performed by resort security. The results showed no entry through our front door #1406, no entry through door #1407 on our right, and a recorded 2:00pm entry into room #1405 on our left. This entry was determined to be made by a member of the resort maintenance department who entered room #1405 at 2:00pm to work on “lighting”. The balcony design at this resort allows an individual to hop over a waist high railing from one balcony to another between certain groups of rooms. These rooms are all connected by a common balcony and are able to be accessed by hopping over the railing. I was told by management that the security guards watch the balconies for such activities. It seems this is a common problem here. Can you imagine what your neck would feel like looking up at balconies all the time? I observed security guards being nothing more than outdoor pool monitors; socializing, reprimanding kids running in the pool area, opening the gate for guests who did not carry their key card, and watching that no guest leaves their personal belongings at a pool chair for more than 30 minutes while swimming. If you do, they will take your stuff. How can you concentrate on effectively watching balconies when you are doing this other nonsense? My opinion is maybe there’s something more going on behind the scenes here. The D.B.P.D. took fingerprints and DNA samples for the record. I requested a viewing of resort security tapes and was told; no manpower (I volunteered), no time (I offered my time), no cameras on the floors or by the elevators, and the cameras they do have allegedly are not located anywhere to be of value in this situation, unless someone just happens to walk by one of them. Apparently the current security system at this resort is useless when you need it most; it is better suited to protect a thief instead of the guests. My experience with management regarding this incident continues as pathetic and very unprofessional. I felt they were very insensitive to our situation. In the 36 hours after our loss, NO ONE from the resort even had the compassion to check on us. They filled out paperwork as routine and conducted no creditable search for our stolen property. At my request, the adjoining rooms were opened and searched for a possible suspect in hiding. I was later somewhat comforted by the insinuation that their insurance would cover our loss, this turned into A BIG JOKE!! We were nothing but pacified in order to keep everything quiet from the other guests. The shift manager slipped the insurance claim paperwork through our door sometime the next night (Friday), not even the common courtesy to meet with us in a professional manner face to face. I told her she could call me at “any time”, she never did. We checked out on Saturday, September 5, 2009, nothing ever felt so good!!! Upon returning home, I contacted their insurance provider and was assigned an “Adjuster”. After my claim was filed, I got nothing but a runaround. My calls to the adjuster went unanswered and were rarely returned, my emails were not replied to, and questions about my claim were avoided. After the insurance adjuster concluded his investigation, I was told the resort felt they were not liable for our loss and therefore it will not be covered. Well, what is the purpose of insurance? I also spoke with Wyndham Corporate executives who refused to accept liability which would have allowed payment for my loss. My loss is a drop in the bucket compared to what they make through their corporate greed. It seems to me that Wyndham calls the shots for the insurance provider and the guest only gets screwed. We are also supposed to get a refund for our room; I will believe that only if it happens. Even if it does, I am still out almost $2500.00 from a resort who could care less about its guests. In order to possibly locate this camera and track down the thief, I am providing a description of only the stolen items which are identified by a serial number. Please circulate this information in an attempt to locate this stolen equipment. If anyone should identify this equipment, please contact the Daytona Beach Police at 386-671-5100.

She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Looks aren't everything and that's all this place has My husband and I, along with another couple, stayed at the Paradisus for 4 nights from 2/28-3/4. Everything other reviewers have said about this hotel's appearance is accurate. The grounds are immaculate, the decor is beautiful, the restaurants are decorated well, the pool is amazing, the beach is great...clearly they have put a lot of money and effort into getting this part of the property right. However there are some major, MAJOR issues with this place that I think others have touched but I feel really need to be elaborated on. Particularly at this price level, these things are just unacceptable I think.#1: The system they have in place for dinner reservations is absolutely absurd. There are 4 beautiful restaurants at the resort, all of which require reservations to eat at. That wouldn't be so bad except you can only make reservations for that day from 9 am - 2 pm and for the next day from 6 pm - 9 pm. If you are arriving at the resort after 2 pm on the day you check-in (as we and many others were) you are out of luck for a dinner reservation on your first night. They will direct you to their dinner buffet which is little more then a taco bar but you can not eat the restaurant, end of story. Our walk to the buffet took us by all the restaurants where we saw at least 4 tables open at each but they WILL NOT make any exceptions, even when we explained we didn't have the opportunity to make the reservation for that night because we'd only arrived at 5 pm AND that they clearly had room for a party of 4 at one of their open tables. This would be annoying anywhere but it's particularly infuriating when you're at an all inclusive resort and have already paid for dinner but their silly system won't allow you to eat where you want! At 6 pm (the first available time to make reservations for the next night), we thought we'd figured out the system and got on the phone to make our reservation for our second night. Somehow, even at 6 pm, the only time they had available for us was 9:45!!!! When we challenged them on how and why this was possible, they just said that's all that's available...no effort to help at all. You are explicity told in your check-in materials that you can only make reservations 1 day in advance but even then we couldn't eat until almost 10 pm?!?! We eventually figured out that they were allowing people to make reservations 2 and 3 days in advance (not what the information they provide when you check in says) so the first night we could get a reservation that was NOT 9:45 was our 3rd night at the resort. Who wants to deal with such hassle when they are supposed to be relaxing on vacation? #2: As you can see, their staff is not very helpful. They seem more hasseled then anything when you address them with a question. We even had a Spanish speaker in our group and that didn't help. With a few exceptions most really couldn't be bothered with explaining why or what something was or even just smiling and saying hello when you pass them in the hall. Again, totally not on par with what I would expect for a hotel billing themselves as a Leading Hotel of the World.#3: THE FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I simply don't understand how anyone can say this food was good, let alone great. We were absolutely perplexed by how horrendous the food was day after day at this resort, regardless of which restaurant or buffet we were eating at. What we originally wrote off as a fluke turned out to absolutelybe the norm there. Foods you would expect to be served hot were warm at best, usually just plain cold. While there would be grills hot and ready to go, you couldn't get a burger cooked to order. Instead you had to take a pre-cooked burger, hot dog, etc from their chaeffers and use one of their stale buns. he cheese display sits in an refridgerated container with only 1 door (the other sliding side is no where to be found) so it's warm and swarmed with flies. Chips on the nacho bar were stale, fries were cold and soggy, pizza was some disgusting frozen pizza...I could literally go on and on and on. The food at their restaurants wasn't any better. We all commented that they appeared to just take the gross food from their buffet and present it nicely on a plate. The french onion soup came out with a 2 square of yellow American cheese on top that was hard as a rock...looked like it had been microwaved or something. In addition to just poor food quality, many of the dishes were just tasteless and bland. We were all so disappointed in the food. None of us are picky eaters and didn't even have high expectations for the food...this isn't even school cafeteria quality. We all commented that a Chili's or TGI Friday's was 5 star compared to what they were serving. So in addition to making you wait until 10 pm, the food they give you is absolutely disgusting! You can understand why we were all looking forward to going home and eating something decent (and by decent I mean Chef Boyardee would have been better then the pasta they were serving at this place) food. After paying this much for a place I wouldn't expect any of these things and would never recommend this resort to anyone. While it's beatiful and the drinks are great, the overall experience is completely shattered by how hard it is to do something basic like eat dinner and then how disgusting the food is. We were looking forward to a relaxing vacation with friends, enjoying some great meals together. Instead we spent much of our time discussing how gross everything was and how a place that is this beautiful could be overlooking such a crictical piece of their guests' experience. In short, if you're thinking about booking at this place, DON'T. And if you already have, I suggest you pack lots of Power Bars or you'll be subsisting on boxed cereal from the breakfast buffet for your stay.Survival Tips We stayed at the Ocean Blue from March 4th -11th, we are in our late 20s and really only need drinks and the beach to have a good time. We have been to Punta Cana before, as well as Cancun, and Riveria Maya. This by far was the WORST experience we have had by FAR. I would highly not recommend this resort to anyone, not even the tax collector!! The only positives we had with this resort were the bartenders, beach, some food, and the weather. But the negatives far outweigh the few positives. I have never wrote a review before but we were so disgusted with the management, apple reps, and guest services that I felt it was my duty to atleast save a few people from this horrible resort. That 4 star rating should not be out of 5, it should be 4 out of 10. So here are a few SURVIVAL TIPS if you dare to try this resort.1.CARRY YOUR OWN LUGGAGE-to your room. We arrived at 4 pm and my girlfriend and I were sweaty, and very eager to get to the pool bar for a dip and a drink. Check in was fast, we got a drink and a cold facecloth. We then went to get our luggage but were told they would bring it to our room. Simple enough. We were only in villa #3 so it was a 3 minute walk we could of brought our luggage and changed and been in the pool by 4:15. We checked in at 4pm. 5 O'clock came and no luggage. We called the front desk and they told us that they had a lot of people checking in and that it would be there shortly. Fair enough, however we were the last in our group to check in. 6 O'clock rolls around and still no luggage, meanwhile we had made a couple of other calls and visited the Apple rep, all said it will be there shortly. A little after 6:30 my girlfriend walked up to the guest services and complained they finally sent people to each villa looking for the luggage. It was finally found at another room. So by 7 pm, 3hours after check in we got our luggage. The pool closes at 7 pm, so we didnt get a swim. But it was a minor incident we blew it off and went to the lobby bar. So carry your own luggage!! 2.DONT PLAN ON SHOWERING- well atleast washing your hair! We were there for 7 days and I think I used soap 2 times! The water pressure is horrendous. I could not even get under the water to rinse off. My girlfriend could not wash her hair. We talked to a lot of people from other villas that had no hot water. We did have hot water atleast but it did us no good. Forget the jacuzzi it would take about an hour to fill it. What is funny about this is that one day we were in the pool and I stepped on something. We looked down and it was a bar of SOAP! Its funny because one night I joked with my girlfriend that i should just go to the pool with some soap to take a shower. I guess someone got my idea!! Funny though I think we counted 3 bars of soap we found in the pool. Again a minor inconvenience, we survived.3.NO GRACIAS- say this to the Timeshare people they are extremely annoying. They wear shirts that say ROYAL on them and are everywhere. Reading reviews on here we heard about them, and had our strategy to avoid them. They are very good though, they have a stand when you go into the buffet for breakfast, and once you walk in your first day, they greet you. Now we thought they were the host to seat you, but they are not. And they are everywhere even on the beach at times.4.USE YOUR SAFE-at all times, daytime, nighttime, when you sleep, AT ALL TIMES!! I cannot stress this enough!! We used the safe during the day, due to the number of people who enter the room during the day like the housekeepers. On our second night, at 8pm we went to get dinner and a drink. We did not think anyone would enter our room at night and did not use the safe. USE THE SAFE at ALL TIMES!! We came back at 11 pm. We were gone for 3 hours. My cellphone was stolen, $100 dollars in one dollar bills(for tips) was taken out of my girlfriends purse, and a 120 dollars was taken from my wallet. YES people enter your room at night when you are gone! It is not a safe feeling. Employees will knock on your door when you are asleep, and enter if you dont answer the door. At all hours of the day and night! BEWARE. I have read other reviews of missing ipods, gucci bags, money, there is definitely a thief working on this resort.5.YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN- Management, guest services, Apple reps, will not help you if anything is stolen. It is a horrible experience of being violated and helplessness. The resort services, management, apple reps all just say, 鈥渟orry for the inconvenience鈥? Nobody cares and nobody will help you. I knew the money was gone, but I had insurance on my cell phone. To use the insurance I needed a report from the hotel or the police that I had reported it stolen. The hotel would not help us in this regard. I did file a report at the hotel and police station, but neither would give me a copy of this report. The police station said that they would investigate it and send me a report in 45 days. I dont know how they are going to investigate it because they didnt even ask me what type of phone it was!! The hotel manager was extremely rude and uncaring. Remember that you are on your own and NOBODY cares what happens to you. One guest rep seemed sad for us but probably couldnt help us in fear for her job. I will be in contact with Apple and the Resort about this.So, that was our great vacation. We paid good money for a vacation and have never in our lives felt so disrespected from a resort or vacation provider. Please if you go here remember these tips, hopefully we can save someone else from our same fate. If you have any questions at all please email me at stivhixon@verizon.net. Spend some more on your vacation and stay at a more reputable resort for you own sake!!My husband booked our room on a travel website recommended by the hotel and we were booked at a rate of $280 per night plus taxes which would've been around $300 total per night. We booked to stay Saturday March 31st- Tuesday April 3rd. We were traveling by car 10 hours from Tampa, Florida and had planned to stop half way Friday night but the drive was smooth and decided to come on into New Orleans. We called the hotel and reached a female clerk late evening that told us they did have a room available that we could check in an evening earlier. We arrived at the hotel at 11:30 pm Friday March 30th, quite cheerful despite our long trip. The parking for check in is in a lot down a back alley behind the lobby and a courtyard. We enter through the back in the rain and there was a man behind the counter with a scowl on his face. He never greeted us. Finally my husband said, "How are you doing?", the man said "Busy!", in an angry tone and looked down. My husband tried to make small talk to lighten him up to no avail. He was very abrupt, made no eye contact and made us to feel like we were unwelcomed. we basically had to make our own introductions to get our check in process started. His whole demeanor was strange and the interaction awkward. Finally we were asked for our credit card after being surprised by the $17 per day parking fee which was supposed to be free for AAA which wasn't accepted. My husband gave the clerk his card. Almost with glee the clerk announced "Your card was declined!" my husband said this couldn't be. He then said very confrontationaly, "Computers don't lie!". My husband said yes computers do lie. We have more than enough available in our account. The clerk made some other demeaning remark. My husband is pretty aggravated at this point and said well yours is wrong! Mr. Phillips snatched up his monitor and shoved it in my husbands face!!! The whole thing seemed crazy like we were on Candid Camera or something. If we were not exhausted we would've walked right out the door! I read on the screen where it did not say the card was declined. It said an over ride was needed. I even said this to the clerk. He insisted we did not have enough money in our account to pay for the room! My husband decides to call our Bank while waiting on the line for several minutes it is finally found out from our bank that they had no record of the card ever being swiped by Maison St. Charles! My husband handed the card back, he swiped it and voilla it went through!! No apology was ever offered by the clerk! As a matter of fact he never uttered another word to us in the lobby. The clerk just handed us a key and a map. That's it. No good evening, nothing. So we just head out the door to roam around in the rain to find our room. We make it to the end of the courtyard and the clerk comes out and yells, "Hey!!". We turn around and he has a slip and a pen and he says "You didn't sign this!". My husband says well you didn't speak or say anything to us so we left. My husband looks at the receipt and now we are being charged $300 per night base plus taxes and parking!!! He said that wasn't the rate we booked he made a note we do not agree with the rate and signed the slip on the side of the wall. It is pouring rain, very little lighting and it's hard to find where the buildings are. We finally get to our room and get to our door of room 304 and the door will not open. We have to go find maintenance who had a trick! You have to pull up on the lever instead of down and use your shoulder to bust it open. He blamed humidity. And our entire 5 day stay this is what we did to get our door open. The room smelled damp and musty and at times had a odor that came from somewhere smelling of raw sewage. I bought Febreeze spray and sprayed constantly, ran the air, etc. temporary fix when the smells became unbearable. The decorator I could see tried to make this shabby place chic. The decorator is to be commended because they used tricks of the trade, paints, fabrics, etc. to draw your eye away from the poor construction of the place. The place has a lot of potential and could be quite nice if some real construction work were possible. The courtyards are nice with fountains and wrought iron patio sets but could use some more flowers. The lobby was done in a New Orleans funky shabby chic style which I appreciate. They even painted some interesting murals on the exterior walls. The sheets, bedding and towels seemed clean. The walls and carpet were filthy. You will note my pictures of unknown brown stains on the walls and human hairs stuck on the bathroom walls that werent ours. We even had a gigantic roach that was trapped in our bathroom tub. I called the front desk to ask for spray. I waited forever. Finally my husband came back killed it and flushed it. The maintenance man that day did finally show up and said I must've left the door open. Well the next morning we had a smaller roach in the bathroom. On our bank called on Sunday and left a message they were shutting off our account due to suspicious activity. We were panicked while on a tour and had to take time out if our paid tour to call the bank back. Our bank proceeded to tell us someone at Maison St. Charles had tried to charge our card for large amounts several times, 5 in total for varying amounts. They blocked all but the agreed upon charge. Our water went out on Monday mid morning and we were told at front desk it would be on in 10 minutes no apology. My husband waited over an hour. I called the front desk and the young lady said be patient another 20 minutes. My husband needed to shower so we could leave for a timed event and went down and asked the plumber himself and the plumber turned the water on for him but it lasted 5 minutes with cold water shower then the water went off, he just gave up and dried off. Again no apology from staff at all. The maid knocked constantly on our door every morning especially one day when my husband had to work in the room. I told her don't worry just give us towels. She seemed aggravated we wouldn't leave! It was around noon. Next door is a Tapas Restaurant called Santa Fe. I enjoyed their specialty drink The Bill Cosby and the company of the owner and many party loving locals. The crowd gets a little wild at night but hey It's New Orleans! The trolley was always too full to use. But cabs were easy to find. The garden district is nice in the day and a little sketchy at night but using common sense you will be safe. There were some pretty good restaurants on St. Charles and if you like Antiques and vintage finds there's a market across the street. This hotel could be charming if it was staffed by a team of friendly, customer service oriented people, mistakes and problems could be overlooked by guests if at least given an apology. We are very amiable and friendly non demanding people, we are not looking for problems.We felt unwelcomed and like we were a nuisance. We certainly did not get what we paid for. This hotel isn't worth $100 per night, much less $300! We've been to New Orleans no less than 20 times. I will never stay here again!I was starving and the small portions were driving me crazy!Service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night.My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful.This hotel was a HUGE disappointment. I booked the hotel about two months in advance for three nights, the first of which was a Universal Studios package (breakfast, Uni Studios tickets and valet parking), the other two the weekend package which included the valet parking. The rates were very admittedly good and unlike one of the reviews I read, the hotel was actually extremely easy to find using google map directions to aide me however upon arriving at the hotel we had to wait for 20 minutes to get into the valet parking area (granted they were having a prom that night). Once we got into the reception area (beautiful but quite empty looking - could use a decorator) we were greeted (and I use that word with a grain of salt) at the check-in counter by a very rude young man who made me feel quite uncomfortable. We got up to our room which was very pretty indeed - until I went into the bathroom where there was a reddish sort of stain on the bathtub and the fixtures were so dirty they looked as though they'd never been cleaned and until I saw the view - we were also on a 'club floor' but with a distressing view of the back of the other building. We waited for our luggage to arrive as we were wanting to go out that evening and needed to change but the time ticked on and on and still no luggage. I also realized that we weren't given our Universal Studios tickets when we checked in nor was there a hotel directory (with room service menu etc) in the room so I called the bellhop to find out where our luggage might be. I was asked by the lady if we had asked for our luggage to be brought up (umm-yup?) to which I of course replied yes, we asked the valet to send it up and even told him exactly which bags were needed. After putting me on hold for an interminable length of time she came back on the phone to say we didn't know you wanted it brought in (umm that's interesting since we were on record with reservations for three days so not really sure what we would do without our luggage which was in plain view in the car!!) and would I like directions to my car so I could go and get it? No exaggeration. Well, I've never been asked this before and was more than a little dumbfounded but after gathering my wits I nicely said no I was under the impression the bellhop would be bringing it up. She then transferred me to the bellhop who shockingly also asked if I would like to come down and get it!! To put this into perspective, my 11 yr old daughter and I were on a three week roadtrip, we had two large suitcases, one smaller suitcase, one laptop, one large toiletries bag and other sundry bags which we carried in ourselves so this was not a manageable amount of luggage for me to go and "pick up" from the lobby. Anyway, they eventually brought it up but let me tell you it was hard to give the guy a tip (even though of course none of it was his fault). I then phoned the front desk to ask about the Uni Studios tickets which they questioned me on saying they had been given to me at check-in which I was again surprised to hear (I guess they didn't believe me?) I told her they had not been given to me which I should think would easily enough be checked. I was again put on hold for ages and when she finally came back she tersely said she'd send them up. I then had to ask her about the hotel directory which she said was a housekeeping issue and that I'd have to speak with them about it at which point she then transferred me although I half expected her to hang up so I'd have to phone them myself. I spoke to housekeeping who were very nice. Our luggage still had not arrived, in fact when it eventually DID arrive it had taken an hour and fifteen minutes. By this time it was too late for us to make our dinner reservations in West Hollywood that I'd had for a month so we had little choice but to order from the room service menu and unlike the person from Nebraska who commented that the prices were reasonable (omg - $16 for a hamburger is not what I call reasonable) I must heartily disagree with them and believe me, I'm not the most budget-minded person by any stretch of the imagination. The bill came...$36 for 1 hamburger, 1 tiny half bottle of 7-Up and 1 piece of apple pie with ice cream which included (although I was not informed about this) the gratuity (I added tip to make the total $40) and taxes. When I phoned a day later to ask why the bill was so high they then told me the gratuity was already added and said they'd refund my $4 tip! - this was not in fact done not that it would have made a difference anyway) Quite unbelievable. I very badly wanted to complain about the whole experience but thought I'd wait another night and see how things went. I didn't end up complaining though I truly wish I had done but only because the person who checked us out was so rude and made me feel so uncomfortable that I felt terribly intimidated - he didn't even ask how our stay was (that would have been the point where I would have said something) or whether everything was to our liking - questions which I have come to expect from the calibre of the hotels I stay in. This all says nothing about the surrounding area which is INDEED slummy looking. The area coming from the north from the highway to the hotel is fine (Mus of Metropolitan Art, etc) but the area an immediate block south and all around from there becomes highly unsafe looking and feeling. I had to advise my daughter not to look at anyone as we were driving by, the area IS ugly and scary looking. Your member from Canoga Park who said the area is NOT unsafe is kidding themselves, when he says "further east of the hotel" he must mean by further, a block, east, west and south as well and I would under no circumstances walk around with my daughter in the area surrounding the hotel, in fact I wouldn't chance it with a male adult either. I will never stay in this hotel again unless they were to take some serious instruction in customer service and the art of dealing with people effectively. Do these people care at all about how they represent the hotel and the impression they leave people? Apparently not but the hotel management should be advised that this is the downfall of the hotel and a probable reason why they get little repeat business. The hotel's architecture is so very, very beautiful and it's history so steeped in tradition that it's a very big shame it should be ruined by the lacking service of many of it's front-line staff. Shame on this hotel and shame on many of it's employees - a HUGE disappointment.NOT an Oasis....more like mucho aggravation I stayed at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana with three of my friends from 07.05.08 - 07.10.08 and found it to be highly unsatisfactory on many levels. We booked with CheapCaribbean because my friends had used the site last year for a trip to Punta Cana and spoke so highly of the service. We thought that the 3 1/2 star resort we chose would surely provide excellent service if it was backed by CheapCaribbean. Upon arriving to our rooms, my friends and I discovered the couch that belonged in my room was on the balcony. We soon discovered why it had been moved outside. It smelled horrible. No alarm clock was provided, as you were told to pay for a wake up call instead. There was no dresser in the room. I specifically requested a King sized bed, but when we checked in, I was told I would have 2 Queens instead. When I actually got to the room, I saw 2 full-sized beds. My friend got an eye infection the first morning we were there. I called down to reception and spoke to Juan who told me there was no medic available in the resort and I would have to take a taxi to the hospital if my friend needed to be seen. Rather than travel through a dangerous and unknown area, we decided to try warm compresses and see if it would help. That was when we discovered there was no hot water in either mine or my friends' rooms. We had to run water through the mini coffee maker in our room to get warm compresses. The next day I spoke to Lourdes, our Turinter travel guide, and she arranged to have my friend driven (In the resort's golfcart) to the next resort to be seen by their medic. Why hadn't this been arranged for us from the start? I was told I had to get a taxi to the hospital. After my friend was seen by the medic, she was made to wait 40 minutes to be picked back up. We found the bartenders to be rude, and most of the staff unwilling to step up and help without the incentive of money. Was this NOT an all-inclusive? Why do I feel like my money is the only thing that will get me some decent service?! Our room was cleaned, but fresh towels were never left. We called down to reception and they stated they would have someone bring us towels. They never showed up. The next morning I walked down to reception and asked for towels in person, only to be told the same story...someone will bring them to me. My friend finally had to track down a maid's cart and take some towels herself! Attempting to eat was another journey. The food was terrible at Windows, the buffet. It was the only restaurant that did not require reservations. And since Lourdes never informed us that we needed to make reservations 2 days prior, and only between certain times, we had to eat at Windows alot. The ice cream at Windows tasted like chemicals. The eggs were very very runny. The only thing that was consistently good was the pasta. We did manage to get 2 restaurant reservations during our stay, and watched as a family of four walked in stating they had no reservations and were seated immediately. Why was I told I could not make reservations for this very restaurant the day before? Both times we had reservations, the place was almost empty. I don't get it. The other place that had food we liked was Beach Gardens. The only problem was, it was almost never open. On several occasions my friends and I stood staring at the restaurant hours, yet there was no one inside during those hours. We were baffled that this place simply didn't comply with ANY set schedule, no less the one posted on their doors. Just getting a beach towel was a hassle. We had to walk around to find a tiny hut in a corner of the resort I didn't know existed. When we got there we were told there were no clean towels. I walked all the way to reception only to be told to go back to the hut and they now have 4 towels waiting for us. Just tell them Juan Carlo sent you. Do I need to KNOW someone to get a beach towel? Again, I don't get it. Unfortunately for us, it didn't stop there. The guide Turinter provided us with was anything but knowledgable, helpful, or even reachable. We spent an entire morning/afternoon trying to track down Lourdes to book an excursion. The first time in the travel room we were told she was downstairs in a meeting. We came back and were informed that Lourdes came back and was told we were looking for her, but has now gone to lunch. After an hour, we also decided to have a late lunch. We ate quickly and went back only to be told that Lourdes had left for the day. Worst of all, on the day we were leaving, she gave us the wrong time to meet the Turinter bus (also already paid for) that would take us back to the airport. When we arrived, we were told the bus already left and were not offered assistance. We explained that our guide had given us a time of 2:20pm and were told it should have been 2pm and it was our problem. Finally, we were told another bus would take us. Thankfully, we say goodbye and leave the resort. Upon arriving at the airport, the driver asks us for $30. At no point were we told we would have to pay this man. We thought they were providing us with transportation to make up for the fact that the guide got us stuck with no way to the airport. I had booked airport transfers to avoid this very issue. Overall, this trip was more of a hassle than a vacation. I've never gone all-inclusive before and have been told it is wonderful. I may try it again, but never with CheapCaribbean. And NEVER at the Grand Oasis Punta Cana.worst holiday resort i ever been to this was my first holiday abroad with my boyfriend which he bought for my bday but the hotel was that bad we were both really disapointed and ended up stayin in on the night of my bday.i would advise anybody who has booked to stay at this hotel to try change it as it will spoil your holiday.we paid for our room upgrading and got put in block 9 which i think was the worst block on the complex.with our package we got private check-in so we thought this would mean we didnt have to queue and would get our room quick.we didnt have to queue,instead we were taken away from the queues and was sat at a table for 1hr by the time we finally did get checked in there were no queues left!these are the problems we had with our stay...you will need about an hour to read this!!roomwhen we finally got to our room it wasnt upto standards it smelt and did not look like an upgraded room(this was just the start)most days our front door did not lock ,when it did we got locked out because it wouldnt unlock,our balcony door was broke for 3days and did not close.our bed side lamps did not work(when we complained somebody was sent to tape the wires up as they were faulty)they sparked when we plugged them in! our tv remote did not not work this meant we couldnt watch the tv as the tv buttons did not work either-we complained but nobody came to fix it.we also had a large gap underneath our door which meant we werent sleepin alone at night as we had all kinds of bugs coming in our room.after going down to reception for the sixth time in 1wk we argued with the staff for 2hrs to be moved to a different room.when we finally got moved to the best block on the complex (block 6) we had the same problems and on the last night our bathroom cieling nearly fell through as there was a really bad leak with water comming through the lights! i went to reception AGAIN and nobody came to see to it for 30mins(a bit dangerous when theres water leaking through the lights) when they did come they just had one look at it and said they will get somebody to come clean it up-nobody came.food and drinkthe only restaraunt i liked was the japanese as the food was cooked in front of you but its always hard to get in that restaraunt as its always booked up.i didnt like the main restaruant as food wasnt covered up and was covered in flies and ants.everybody we met up with had a stomach bug as did myself and my boyfriend and we are both off work now as were still poorly.we booked a trip and was happy to get away from the hotel for the day but as food wasnt served till dinner time on the trip we decided to go to the main restaurant for breakfast at 7.00am,we were getting picked up at 7.30am-we were stil waiting at 7.20am because the ovens werent workin so ended up leaving for the day without breakfast.on our last day one of the snack bars was closed down as it was so dirty!the drinks in the bars are limited there is only one beer they have and its flat and tastes horrible the vodka and rum they have is also nasty it tastes so strong.we went all-inclusive and had to pay for our drinks in the disco which by the way is rubbish we only went once and the music was spanish and it fit about 30ppl in.entertainmentit states on the internet that the hotel has its own beach party wkly,i thought this would be good-i was wrong! its a party for the locals that come to stay at the hotel every wknd the party lasts most of the night and is very noisy keeping you up all night.be carefull if you do go to this hotel and want to do parasailing as me and my boyfriend got charged 90 dollars and then found out two other couples got charged 50 dollars from the same man(he calls himself the king of the beach you cant miss him)the hotel only has one bar with entertainment and it is poor,we stayed in most nights for the first wk until we met some friends,michelle,gary and goerge and margaret who made our holiday.staffthe bar staff were really ignorant and not helpful!!we went with first choice who have their own rep(melanie) living on sight which i thought is really helpful to have but when we had a problem she didnt want to know.when we had all the problems with our first room we argued with a member of staff(santa) for 2hrs for her to tell us to come back at 5pm with our bags packed to be ready to change rooms,this was at 10am.when we went back she had gone home and told nobody about the room so there wasnt one ready for us move into we were then told we had to go back the next day.all these problems in just 2wk i may sound like i complain too much but when you've paid alot of money to have your dream holiday and you get this its very disapointing.i would never go back to that hotel in fact it as put me and my boyfriend going back to the dominican altogether.The wait staff was loud and inconsiderate.There was a strong and pervasive urine-like odor in the lobby throughout my stay. It was not particularly hot outside (temperature data on weather.com shows the temperature ranged from 14 to 27 degrees Celsius). It became apparent almost immediately that members of the hotel staff were incompetent and rude. We stayed at the hotel as part of a wedding group, and the staff was supposed to deliver gift bags to our rooms, which they didn't. At the groom's urging, we went downstairs to pick ours up from the front desk. The staffperson there inquired suspiciously as to whether we had just been in our rooms. When we said yes, she muttered that this didn't make sense because the staff had just tried to deliver the bags, so if we'd been in our rooms we should have received ours. Primarily what prompts this review, however, is the hotel's refusal to accept responsibility when it became clear that the maid had thrown out my orthodontic retainers -- which I left drying in the bathroom over the side of a glass. Replacing the retainers thanks to the maid's error will cost me over $700. But getting someone from the hotel to even return my calls, let alone do anything but patronize or BS me, was an ordeal. When I arrived home and began unpacking my things, I realized that the retainers had not been where I left them in the hotel bathroom (dangling over a glass). The maid had rinsed the glasses and turned them upside down, and apparently discarded what was resting on them. I immediately called the hotel and asked them to check if the maids had found my retainers. They transferred me to the voicemail of the "Executive Housekeeper," who did not return my call until 5 days later. I called again the next day, and when the person at the desk answered in what sounded like French, I asked if it would be alright if I spoke English. He snippily said, "Well I just spoke English, so yes." He told me the maids had found nothing, and that the only hotel employees who could tell me whether the hotel had insurance or any other way to compensate me would be out of the office for another 5 days. I was forwarded to the voicemail of one such alleged person, left a message, and waited 5 days, but she didn't call me back either. So after 5 days I called again and spoke with another "manager" who purported to know nothing about the hotel's insurance or whether the hotel could reimburse me and said he would need to consult the person whose return call I was still awaiting. Later that day, he called me to say the hotel has no insurance to cover my situation, but that he recommends I investigate whether I have my own insurance that might compensate me. For example, he told me, another hotel manager once had a houseguest whose personal insurance compensated her when a dog ate her shoes. Not helpful. When I asked him to confirm that the hotel has no insurance FOR WHEN EMPLOYEES DESTROY GUESTS' PROPERTY, he confirmed, and told me, irrelevantly, that the hotel's deductible for damage to its own common areas is so high that once upon a time, when a teenage guest opened a fire sprinkler and caused $14K damage to a stairwell, the tour group had to assess each teenager $100 to compensate the hotel. When I pointed out the story's irrelevance, he cut to the chase and tells me the hotel policy is to never cover valuables left in the room outside the safe. I explained that my wet retainer, left drying over a glass in the bathroom, is "valuable" to no one but me -- in that respect similar to a wet toothbrush -- and is not like money or electronics that belong in a safe. I also explained that in this case I'm not claiming something was stolen, but that a hotel employee destroyed something. And then he simply became ridiculous, treating me as though I were making a false claim or simply a fool. He asked whether I had inquired about the retainer before checking out. I re-explained my timeline and again noted the irrelevance of his question, as maids are never supposed to throw these things out. He then said, in ultimate double-speak, that he's "sorry" about what happened but actually doesn't believe the maid would have discarded the retainers "because they're trained not to do that, and I'm "making a serious accusation." (Apparently the maids at Hotel du Fort never make mistakes, and saying somebody mistook a retainer for garbage is a "very serious accusation.") I told him I'm not fabricating the story and offered to send him a copy of the orthodontic bill. I also explained that even the world's best maid might mistake a clear retainer for garbage. He again said he's "sorry" and knows how people "freak out" about orthodontia, but while he believes I lost the retainers, he doesn't believe they came to be lost in the way I claim. I tell him it's hardly an apology when the hotel doesn't take any responsibility. Then he resorted to asking if I checked my luggage carefully, and I suggested that instead of going around in circles like this he get back to me after he checks with his alleged manager (the one with the helpful story about the dog) re compensation. He later called to say that the hotel will not reimburse me for my stay because "there is nothing we can do about it" (of course there is - they can reimburse me for my stay!), but if I want to come back again, they'll be happy to upgrade me "at the best rate ever." What a joke. Don't stay here. And if you do, cram everything into the safe, including your wet dental items.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.April 2006 Member , Calgary, Alberta Just got back from Las Vegas. Booked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel after checking it out on the tripadvisor. Although it was rated to be above average hotel, we found that it was poorly managed and very inefficient in PR and poor co-ordination between management and guest. The check-in was a wash. There was no proper lines formed to ensure proper service to guest as the queue just form at each counter instead of a single queue that would ensure first come first serve. Registered guest could not ask a simple question (eg. where is the elevator?) without queuing behind a long line of new registering guest. Poor information on whereabouts of main locations i.e. elevators to the floors. Simple task like putting a floor plan at the registration area would help especially for 1st time guest. Poor layout of casino area that forces everyone to venture anywhere to pass through the smoke screen before they get anywhere. Children and non-smokers do not appreciate having second hand smoke! Poor coordination of information i.e. the pool times even among staff was not properly conveyed and limited pool usage time from 9.00a.m. to 6.00p.m. only. The wave pool is a joke with one wave every 5 minutes!! The rental of tube is $20.00. The gym is $30 per day use. I thought a 4 star hotel provide basis gym facilities!! Food is expensive despite being a casino. Guest were complaining to the staff and the staff did expressed their sympathy but could not help much except to direct the guest directly to the senior management which we did voice out our opinion. I do sympathize with the staff having to put up with the constant complains from the guest and also the second hand smoke that they have to endure all day and night. We requested a non-smoking room but was given a smoke filled room. The staff managed to change it for us. Although the rooms were large but unfortunately not very clean compared to smaller hotels. The elevators corridor was a zoo with all 3 wings converging in a central location serving 2 thousand rooms and guest trying to move their baggage up and down and guest trying to ride the elevators. We took the elevator up while going down to fight the rush to get into one. A couple of guest realise that it was faster to ride up and come down than wait for an elevator to go down. There are 3 hotels inside the Mandalay Bay hotel and this is very confusing to the 1st time guest especially for parking and getting around. A floor plan was handed out at check-in but the prints were tiny to know where to go. So it comes back to asking the front desk which involves waiting in line. We had a lunch and a dinner inside the hotel and found the prices more expensive than necessary considering that we could have better value elsewhere. We booked for 5 nights but checked out after 2 nights and headed for Palm Springs instead of enduring another 3 nights at a much higher room rate. One other guest in line also decided to check out despite having good reviews in her previous stays because she had to wait 45 minutes to get a simple answer from the front desk as people were cutting into her queue without realizing that she was waiting. Despite the huge income generated from the casino, I know that the hotel need to depend on continued satisfied guest that consider Las Vegas as a destination area and also a good value vacation spot. If it was just for the gambling, any casino without facility would do for gamblers. But if the Las Vegas hotels are to survive in the distant future, it should start to seriously consider the huge customer base that do not smoke and not necessary gamble big but spend considerable amount i.e. Disneyland, Universal Studios, Knotts Berry farm, even New York City etc. It is the consistent and larger group of people that are prepared to spend and enjoy what they value i.e. good food, fun and entertainment. After all the over-rated reviews of Las Vegas, my wife and daughter have decide never to go back as it was not a good experience for the money's worth. As for myself, I see the failings of these mega hotels in placing too much emphasis on being big and extravagant but forgetting that it is the efficiency, friendliness, thoughfulness, cleanliness, basis amenities, good value and enjoyable stay that makes a hotel. To proof my point, I know that hotels in New York City are very much smaller and rooms are tiny in comparison yet they are more appealing and yet more expensive in most of them. New York City may not have the gambling and vice appeal but it is still much more fun than Las Vegas with all the glitter and shine. For families planning to visit Las Vegas for family fun time, go any where else with a decent wave pool than Mandalay Bay.Recall.My dog loved this the first few meals then was not interested.

We had been up since 5.30 a.m. an hour a half drive to the airport a ten hour flight then standing for 1 and a half hours through customs 3 planes, 4 passport control people, not a good start. Then on bus for 1 and half hours. Got to reef, throwing it down, went to check in, young girl said to leave our cases and then took myself, my wife and son to desk. she started to explain about hotel, we just wanted to get to our room shower and something to eat, at the end of her sales pitch she said you have meeting with me in two days time, to make sure you turn up you give me 100 pesos and you will get it back when I see you. I was too tired to realise what was going on, but next day when I read the slip of paper it was clear I had been conned out of money to force me to attend a time share meeting. This is no way to treat guests at your hotel, you expect that from out in the street, but by people who meet and greet you as soon as you walk in, bang out of order. Kids club, only any good if your kids have a great tan and speak spanish, other wise, your kids are quickly returned to you when the girl takes the others to the beach. We knew kids like ours who went once and never went again, a real real shame. No entertainment for kids during day in pool, geared more towards adults, pool volleyball, water polo, beach volleyball, kids were told to beat it by the entertainment staff at the beach volleyball, I know, I was next to the kid who got to told kids were on later. In the two weeks the kids never got on later. But the entertainment guys and girls were good at what they did, they did do a great show at night for the kids, shame more effort wasnt spent on them during the day, as the entertainment was more for adults, and kids are left round the pool watching the adults play. Location, stunning, beach stunning, staff mostly friendly. Reception, maybe if you pass them a couple of bucks they would get things for you that you need in the room. After 3 days asking for extra coathangers I instead got the maid to get some for me and she did straight away. Sea safe to bath in, snorkel free, go the other side of sandbags and see the fish. amazing. But here come the real bad part, half of the guests came down with sickness, dizzyness and the runs during our second week. Yanks, Brits, Dutch, Hungarians, no one spared. No explanation was ever given to what caused it, no warning, no announcement, no letter to the rooms, but all around you people were not eating, drinking, or even coming out of their rooms. People were dizzy, sick and had no energy. I had this for 6 days, for 35 hours I never ate a single thing, for the rest of the time it was a bit of soup a bit of toast and not much else, I had no stomach for food or desire. At this point you didnt know if it was the food, the water, the pool, the drinks you were served, who knows, it made everyone wary of everything. My son got the runs so did my wife. We ate hardly anything, you felt sick all the time, and then what you did eat came shooting out your backside so fast it nearly broke the land speed record. Trips were cancelled, as you couldnt go anywhere with out being 30 mins from a toilet that you were going to mess up really bad. The doctor was called to most people, 30-40 rooms were affected. At least the Hotel paid for the Doctors fee and tablets, but in my case they didn't even work. Usually when you go on holiday you come back needing to go on a diet, no need at the reef, shed pounds in the sun, the only thing is the toilet basin looks browner than you. The drinks are not cold, they put ice in them to make them cold, is the water they serve really treated, are the plastic cracked glasses they serve the drinks in that clean? Is the food served in the snack bar cooked well enough? One thing is for sure, if you dont finish your snack bar food and just leave it on the table, within 5 secs at least 10 birds like ravens will be all over the plate and the table, the staff do not clear up quickly enough, and the tables are never, ever, wiped clean after the birds have been on them So can I assume that I spent 6 days of my holiday because of bad hygiene, I don't know! Obviously because of the the buffet system we all use the same long spoons to gather the food from tray to plates, so all it takes is one person to be ill, not wash their hands and you can guess the rest. Maybe the above event will never happen again at the reef, but im afraid I couldnt wait to get home, eat some normal food and know where it came from and who made it. This review maybe bitter, but when your son is crying because he didnt make it in time to the toilet and messed up his pants and t-shirt you cant help but feel that someone somewhere should have let people know there was an outbreak and moved us on or something, just anything, we just felt trapped in a sick hotel not knowing what was going on, or how long it would last. Would I come back to the Reef, maybe if I want to lose some weight I will!!! Dont think that going to the Mexican or Italian resteraunts will help, the food in the buffet is better, and the water they serve is warm and cloudy, and I never got to finish my Italian meal, had to leave half way through and then was up at 1 in the morning throwing up, then parking my bum in the toilet seat for an hour. Next year Butlins at Skegness, not really!!!! On the plus , weather was superb!!!!But the meals were terrible.I am actually staying at the Desert Rose at the moment, have been here for 6 nights as I am unable to shorten my stay without being charged for the full week. Not enjoying it one little bit so it's difficult to know where to start with my comments. Firstly I would like to warn anyone staying here of the telephone charges. I made three calls to the UK on the room phone for 3 mins 20 seconds, 3 mins 59 seconds and 4 mins 35 seconds - the charges for these calls were $53, $46 and $53 respectively. Obviously I'd expect a call from a hotel phone to be something like $10 for a few minutes but that is ridiculous. When I complained to the manager they simply had no explanation but agreed that their charges are 'extortionate'. Thanks guys. Secondly, the place is infested with moths. To a massive extent. I have just killed three of these in the last hour and they have plagued the week I have spent here. I have had them crawling on me, flapping in my ear while I was asleep, everywhere. Disgusting. Thirdly, there is a roach problem, although I have only caught 2 or 3 in my actual room, the corridors and outdoors are really bad and other guests have complained about their rooms being worse. And they're big ones too. Fourthly, although the place looks close to the big hotels when you look on a map or Google Earth, the walk is really terrible - the sewers in this block smell absolutely disgusting - to the extent that I wretched repeatedly, and there is no proper lighting. My girlfriend was approached in a car during the late afternoon and since there is virtually no one around the area and it backs onto the testosterone-fueled-moronic-whoop-fest which is Hooters Hotel it was a worry. Fifthly, forget about the pool. There are 144 large condos in this development. with I suppose an average of 3 people staying in each. There are approx 35 sunbeds. You do the maths, but even in Vegas people do like to use the pool and this one is woefully inadequate. It's not that great either. For the last four days we have been walking the mile or so to the Luxor to pay $10 to use their pool - didn't expect to have to do that but there is literally no choice. Sixthly, it's the noisiest place I've stayed since I last went to Ibiza aged 18. I didn't come to Vegas for the peace and quiet but when I put the do-not-disturb sign on the door (that incidentally says "Shhhh... I'm sleeping") I don't really expect housekeeping to slam their trolleys relentlessly against the walls and constantly SHOUT at each other. That was really bad. Other guests were loud idiots too, but I'm not blaming that on the hotel (oh, okay, go on then I will). Finally, far be it for me to be a snob but the clientele that this place attracts are very hit and miss. The breakfast buffet is like feeding time at the zoo. I't's held right in the middle of the lobby, the food is shocking and in order to reduce costs (I guess) the management provide nowhere to eat properly, no trays and flimsy plastic plates. I saw someone with a bowl of bran flakes with a hard boiled egg balanced in the middle while they poured milk on them. Another elderly lady was perched on an easy chair in her nightdress, she had clearly walked directly from bed to the buffet bypassing every sink, hairbrush and item of everyday clothing. A pink nightie with no underwear, shoes or socks was just the ticket for her mealtime - and just the thing to put me off eating. I only went to the buffet once although I did get some jam on my clothes when I sat down in the lobby another day (does that count?). I'm a well travelled chap and I'm very reasonable and give credit where it's due. The hotel was good about calling taxis to get us from A to B. The concierge booked a nice restaurant for my birthday and generally the place is spacious. The staff were on the whole functional but not particularly friendly or exceptional. I'm quite reluctant to say this is a bad hotel, because I did a lot of homework before I booked this trip and virtually everywhere I looked said this place was great. But in all honestly it's not. It's pretty damn bad. And I hate to admit I picked the wrong place but I did. But please don't stay here unless you get a knock-out cheap rate. There are way better places to stay in Vegas and some hotels have real bargain rates at the moment. If you do stay here don't make any phone calls, don't expect to use the pool, enjoy your breakfast, have any peace and quiet or a pleasant stroll to the strip. And bring a nose clip unless you like the smell of sewage. Oh, and ear plugs to drown out the noise of the outdated air-con. Do bring a microscope because the bugs and crawlies could make excellent study projects for the kids.How pretentious and inappropriate for MJ Grill to claim that it provides power lunch and dinners!First, I am not a snobby tourist who pays for cheap hotels but expects total luxury. I grew up camping and backpacking, staying in cheap and seedy hotels, and just being excited to have a hot shower....so a stay at a hilton is luxury to me! That being said....I recently had an experience at the LV Hilton that I am never going to forget! Let me briefly set the scene....I was really excited to go to Vegas for two reasons: 1) I'd never been there and 2) I was going to Vegas to get married. I lived in Florida and my fiance is a sailor in the navy, stationed in California. So Vegas was a nice neutral place to throw two families together. My family isn't made of money, so we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel, that was comfortable, but wouldn't break the bank for anyone coming to the wedding. The Hilton had solid reviews and a good price tag. So away we went! I arrived with my family a day before my fiance got into Vegas. We checked in, I received 2 full beds instead of 2 queens, which was sort of annoying, but I'm not picky. Our main complaint at this point was that our entire wedding party (twenty people and about 12 rooms) were scattered all over the hotel. We booked a solid 2 months ahead, and called two weeks, and a week before we got there to make sure that our rooms were together. They never were...but oh well! That first night I went to bed and woke up at roughly 6 am to a sound that I can only describe as a mix between a jet engine and an earthquake. At first I thought it was the air conditioner, so I played with that, to no avail. Then I figured out it was the pipes. I went into the bathroom and played with the faucet on the bathtub until I thought I had figured out how to make it go away. It did it again at 8 am when I was in the bathtub...there I am in the tub relaxing and all of a sudden I thought a plane was about to take off in my hotel room. It stopped after about 5 minutes and a lot of jiggling with the faucet. So the next day my fiance got in, I hadn't seen him in 2 months and all I wanted to do was lay in our hotel room and spend some time together. We went to sleep at around 11 and at 2 am the plane decided to take off again in our room, it scared the bejesus out of my fiance and I proceeded to bound out of bed into the cold hotel room to play with the faucet on my bathtub. It did it again at 6 am and at this point we were just too tired and annoyed to care and just laid there for the 5 minutes until it decided to go away by itself. I had given up on the idea of sleeping well anytime in the next 3 days but my father found out about our room and got us a new one. We packed up our stuff that afternoon and headed over to our new room. We had places to go and wedding stuff to do so we just dropped our luggage off in the room and took off. We had dinner at Hard Rock that night with my family (loads of fun, they made us stand on top of chairs and blow out a candle on a sundae when they found out we were getting married, and I'll never forget my entire family doing YMCA along with the music as long as I live) and then KA (at the MGM Grand....if youve got the money...go see it!!!!!!). We got back pretty late from KA, at around 12:30 at night, and just wanted to get into our bed and sleep. We got back to the hotel and I walked straight to my luggage and my fiance went into the bathroom to pee. At that instant he yelled "did you leave the sink running???!!!"...."ummmm no" I said, and came over to see what he was talking about. The tile floor in our bathroom and leading into our bedroom was covered in water. At that moment I put two and two together. When we had first gotten into the new room I noticed what looked like silt on the inside of the sink. I thought nothing of it and just rinsed out the sink and the black silt and left. When we found the room flooded I figured it out, our sinks had backed up and overflown. So I sent him down to get us a new room and packed all out stuff back up for the second move of our 3 day trip. They wouldn't give him the keys because the room was under my name...at this piont I was getting annoyed and went back downstairs with him to get us a new room. The woman was nice, but...well...when I told her our room was flooded...she said "do you need a new room right now??" and I, in the most polite way I could muster, said "let me explain, our room is flooded, as in both sinks are filled with water and our floor is covered with water...its completely unusable". So....they upgraded us to a second floor luxury room....and by 1:30 we made it into our new room. It was impressive to say the least.....two flat screen tv's, marble sinks and tile, a walk in shower with a waterfall showerhead, down pillows and comforter, a living room area, and a king size bed. But before we got to bed, we throughly walked through and inspected the room, because my fiance and I were absolutly convinced there had to be something wrong with it. Well we didn't find anything and had an excellent nights sleep. Now you would think this would be the end of our adventure at the LV Hilton, but you would be sooooo wrong. We got up that morning, with only enough time to take a shower before we had to head off. So we decided to save time and simply take a shower together. We got in and lathered up, but we had left the sliding door to the shower/toilet room open (it was seperate from the sinks). My fiance wanted to close it so we could get some nice sauna/hot air action going on in the shower. So he popped out, half in the shower, half out, and gently pulled the lever on the sliding door to shut it. Well it shut...and when it did, 3 tiles came flying off the wall in the shower at me. I screamed and then started laughing....there's what we were looking for last night....there HAD to be something wrong with the room. He wanted to get out immediately but it was just some broken tile and we really didnt have time to deal with it, so I just pushed it into a corner with my foot. We continued our nice shower, although, we often accidently stepped on a peice of tiny broken tile I had missed. When my father checked us out he told them what had happened, with all three rooms, and they did give us 7 buffet vouchers.....but I honestly just don't think that was enough. I had to laugh though, no one else in our wedding party had quite the time that we did...there stays were all quite normal and I was happy for that. So, that being said, I'm not sure how to sum up my experience with the LV Hilton. It is a hotel that is certainly showing it's age, that is certain. Are you guaranteed an experience anywhere close to mine? No....but the thing to remember....is that it is possible....because it happened to me. Some people might think I made this up.....but I don't think I could have made this experience up if I tried!Where should I start? I went with my husband and 20 year old daughter. This place is way over priced and way, way over rated! The first room was, (after we managed to get security to let us in because the electronic lock was broken) not the size room I reserved and paid for in advance and it was torn apart. The carpet was disgusting. The walls trashed and the vases or whatnots on the shelf next to the TV were broken and had sharp pointy edges. Luckily for our family we do not have small children. The couch, chair and stove where torn apart as if someone was in the middle of searching for something or perhaps got interrupted during cleaning. The trash was on the on top of the bar where guest are supposed to eat. I called to complain about the size and condition of the room and was told "Rooms are not guaranteed." What? They sure as heck took my money in advance to guarantee that I would show up! The least they could have done was to give me what I paid for! I was told "there is nothing we can do the resort is booked." No apologies on the wrong room no nothing - just tough. The front desk did agree to send someone up to clean the room, but when the maid got there all she did was drop off a couple of bars of hand soap and leave without cleaning a stinking thing. So resigned to getting ripped off and stuck in a substandard filthy room, my husband and I go to the bedroom to unpack for our two day stay and found that the linen was visibly filthy. I called down and ask for clean linen. Of course they didn't bring it so I had my daughter call back down and ask again. This time a male staff member was extremely RUDE to my daughter and asked her why I wanted clean linen. You would think that an explanation for clean linen would not be needed. The TV remote didn't work which wasn't a big deal until I tried to turn it on manually and found that the on/off button had been removed or yanked out. There was a whole where normally a button would be and I wasn't about to stick my finger in it so I called to ask for batteries. I think this fourth, fifth or sixth call to the front desk finally made them take note and miraculously a room (the type I paid for) became available. So now we are in room two after wasting hours of our vacation time. We get in this second room which at first glance seems to be cleaner and in better working order. We go about our day trying to enjoy the pool which by now is filled to capacity with nowhere to sit. We won’t discuss the issue with the pool towels and the policy on getting a clean one. Suffice to say, bring your own detergent. We go get lounge chairs and take them down to the beach where finally we can start to relax on our vacation. That night, my daughter goes to make her bed on the pull out couch only to find that she has no pillows. We only had three undersized flat pillows on our bed so we call down and ask for three more pillows. Two were to be used by my daughter and another one for me since a recent surgery requires I maintain a certain posture. This usually isn't a problem with most resorts. At any rate, I wait up fully dressed, listening to what seems like the loudest air conditioner on the planet and smelling something rotten emanating from the AC closet, so that I can answer the door when the pillows arrive. That of course never happened. I woke up fully dressed still waiting on pillows the next morning. We called down to the front desk another two or three times that day asking for pillows, only to be told that the maid or runner said she left them in the room (we were in the room – no one came). My daughter assured the front desk that we did not receive pillows, but was treated very rudely and suspiciously by staff again. Finally after hours of waiting and fussing with staff my husband and I went down to the beach. I won’t even go into the third degree the man at the wristband counter gave me when I tried to get wristbands for the pool area for day two. Apparently you have to put the hospital like disposable wristbands on loosely enough to take them off when you are not at the pool are (which for my husband is impossible) or wear the hideous red thing for however long your stay is, because they are only going to give you one. At any rate, my daughter calls me shortly after we leave the room to tell me, much to my horror and utter disbelief, that staff sent a runner to search our room. That was it! That was all the abuse I was going to take from these over puffed, over inflated, pompous you know what's, so I went to talk to management face to face. I calmly, because you get more flies with honey, asked for the manager in charge and was greeted by a very friendly young lady who assured me that they would be dealing with the runner who had the audacity to search a guest’s room. I explained part of the ordeal that we had been put through over the past couple of days and she seemed sympathetic. She told me to expect a phone call from a Robert somebody within the next couple of days. That never happened. I asked for corporation’s phone number on day one from a staff member at the front desk, but found that when I tried to call it, it was a bogus number! We checked out before 10:00 a.m. on our scheduled departure day. We could not wait to say good riddance to the so highly rated pathetic excuse of a resort. We all vowed to let anyone who asked us about the place know exactly what happened and what we thought. We vowed to NEVER AGAIN visit Wyndham's Ocean Walk Daytona. You would think the mistreatment would stop there, but nooo. Low and behold, when I got my credit card statement you will never guess what they did. You would expect that after knowing what their staff did to our family or how crappy and out of shape the rooms were that they put us in, they would give us a small discount, but noooo. They charged us for an extra room and I have been given nothing but the run around for going on two weeks trying to get it off my credit card! I’ve called the direct line of the gentleman that I booked the vacation with but he said he can’t do anything about it because it was a charge that the hotel or resort or whatever they claim to be, put on my card. I talked to several people at the resort before getting a hold of a manager or assistant manager who requested a copy of my credit card statement (of which I emailed her over a week ago). She stated that she would call me back the next day. But you know that never happened either! I’ve left her voicemail after voicemail, but all I hear are crickets. I have been reduced to disputing the charge on my credit card. My next stop, other than letting everyone under the sun know how miserable a state the resort is in and how absolutely despicable the staff members are, is to make a complaint with their local better business bureau, and the Central Florida Visitors bureau. Innocent law abiding citizens such as myself (who also happens to be a War Veteran) and my family members should not be subjected to having their only vacations ruined by such conglomerates.I booked the Park Central New York after looking at several hotels in midtown Manhattan that were close to Carnegie Hall. I booked a concierge room with a king size bed from Wednesday, June 11, 2008 - Monday, June 16, 2008. From the pictures on the website, the hotel looked comfortable and clean. When I arrived at the hotel, it seemed hot in the lobby but I figured that it was just me because I had been walking with all of my luggage. When I got to the room, I realized that it wasn't me. The air conditioning was out in the room. The fan was on in the air conditioning unit, but it was blowing out air that was room temperature (which was easily 90 degrees). I spoke with the lady at the front desk about the lack of air conditioning in my room and I asked her if I could be moved. She stated that the air conditioning was out in the entire hotel so it would do no good to be moved. I asked her when the air would be fixed and she said that she had no idea. She went on to say that the air had been out for over a week and they are just taking it day-to-day at this point. The temperature in the hotel was the topic of conversation for every guest that I encountered in the elevators and the lobby. People were checking out of this hotel as quickly as they could. Although I was uncomfortable, I tried to make the best of it and see if I could sleep in the room. Due to the high temperature and the fact that there was absolutely no air circulation, I was not able to fall asleep for hours. I lay in bed most of the night sticking to the sheets, tossing and turning in vain to find a cooler spot. By the next morning, I realized that I was not going to be able to stay in this hotel for 4 more days. So, I checked on the Wellington Hotel across the street. They had air conditioning that worked and the rooms were clean and comfortable and they were over $100 less per night than the rooms at the Park Central New York. So, I checked in at the Wellington on Thursday, June 12, 2008 and checked out from the Park Central New York on the same afternoon. When I told the gentleman at the front desk of the Park Central New York that I was checking out due to the air conditioning, he said that he understood. Then, he told me that the hotel would be charging me for my entire reservation with the exception of Sunday night. My original reservation was for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I was checking out on Thursday afternoon and the gentleman at the front desk actually said the hotel was going to charge me for 4 nights that I was not sleeping in the hotel. I couldn't believe it. I demanded to speak to the hotel manager and stated that I wasn't going to be paying. The gentleman at the front desk went back to speak with his manager and then came back to tell me that the hotel would not charge me for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. However, they were still going to charge me for Wednesday and Thursday night. I still couldn't believe that they were going to charge me for a night that I had not stayed. Then, I saw the rate that they intended to charge me. They were charging me $400/night. When I had booked the room on the website, I had booked a concierge room. The website has a promotion where you get 20% if you stay for 5 or more nights. The total reservation came to $1,700 for 5 nights. I could not understand how the hotel was now charging me $853 for just 2 nights. I told the gentleman at the front desk that I was not even given a concierge room with a king size bed as I had requested in my reservation because one was not available when I checked in at 7:30 PM on Wednesday night. He went back to speak with his manager about my rate and stated that they would take $100 off of my charge for Thursday night. So, my final bill for staying in this hotel for 1 night in a room that was not air conditioned and did not have a king size bed as reserved and was not a concierge room as reserved was $753. This is complete and total highway robbery. I would also like to mention that the wireless Internet in the room I stayed in was not working and neither were 3 out of the 5 lamps in the room. I would also like to mention that the linens on the beds were stained with what looked like dried blood. There was no bellhop to assist us with our luggage when we checked in either. The elevators were extremely slow, but the hotel has signs up that say that they are renovating the elevators. From the dust on those signs, I would say that they have been up for months. After having such a bad experience with the Park Central New York, I contacted my parents and my sister and her husband who were planning to check into the Park Central New York the next day. I told them to cancel their reservations immediately because the hotel had no air conditioning and because of the horrible service. They cancelled their reservations 24 hours before they arrived, but the Park Central New York still charged them for their entire 2-day reservations. My family is now going through the chargeback process with their banks to have these charges reversed. I would like to mention that I checked into the Wellington Hotel across the street from the Park Central New York hotel on Thursday afternoon. The room there was extremely clean and comfortable, my room was larger, had an Italian marble bathroom, a walk-in closet, an incredible view of Times Square and my total bill for a 4 night stay was only $1,052. It is hard to believe that the Park Central New York would act like they did and charge what they did when there is a better hotel that costs less money directly across the street. Frankly, I'm surprised that the Park Central New York hotel is even still in business. My advice to anyone who is planning on staying at the Park Central New York hotel is to stay at the Hotel Wellington. You'll be much more comfortable there and pay less money for your stay and there is absolutely no difference in the geographic location since the hotels are across the street from each other. Please avoid the Park Central New York hotel at all costs.This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Once my family and I arrived at the hotel around 1pm, we asked if we could have an earlier check in, since we were traveling since 5am with 3 young children. The clerk at the check in told us to come back at 2:30 pm. when we returned at 2:30pm, another clerk rudely informed us that check in was at 4pm. Of course, we already acknowledged that, but we were told that we could come back at 2:30 to receive the keys to our rooms. In a totally unprofessional manner, she proceeded to call what i assume was the cleaning staff, and carried a conversation in front of me about how” they were here from 1pm,etc." and hung up the phone and said that the rooms are not ready yet, and to come back in another 20 mins. She did not seem to care at all about this being a major inconvenience to us. The staff continually asked us to come back in 20 mins until at least 1 hour+ had passed. My children were in the car tired, hot, and uncomfortable since 1pm and now for over 3+ hrs, the staff was completely uninterested and did not offer, not even a single room temporarily for us to use to freshen up etc, until our rooms would be ready. We had booked 2 adjoining rooms to accommodate my family of five, and we received no services for the inconvenience of being kept waiting without our rooms, not even a cold drink for my family, or even a complimentary snack for having to wait. After waiting past the policy check in time of 4pm, we still did not have our rooms. The staff continually claimed how the carpet was wet from being cleaned in the afternoon. I was very upset since this is now 3+ hours and still no rooms to check in to. I insisted on speaking to a manager. He really did not provide any immediate satisfaction to rectify the situation at that point. He said they were understaffed, and there wasn’t anything he could do but apologize, which was no help to me. After I demanded something to offer us for this major inconvenience of our 1st day in Orlando, he reluctantly offered 1/2 price for the 1 room for the 1st night’s stay, and a free breakfast voucher. This really wasn’t enough after ruining our afternoon. When we finally got our rooms, there were no bellhops readily available to assist us with our baggage. all my children including a 6 and 8 year old had to help carry the bags to the rooms. there was only one bellhop that we seen on duty. try to find him is the name of the game there. The kids eat free program is a farce since they overcharge for breakfast at $9.99 for each adult when one could easily go down u.s. 192 west or east and eat breakfast for $3.99 and it wont matter if the kids are free or not. The dinners were overpriced as well, and we never ate at the hotel for this reason. Even if the kids were to eat free, there menu did not offer many dining choices for a family. On to the rooms, they were clean, but the towels are as hard as sandpaper, not even full bath size towels, and the beds really give the feeling of sleeping on concrete blocks, not mattresses. The main pool is nice looking on there website, and is another reason why we chose this hotel. However, it simply cannot handle the volume of guests the week we stayed. There seemed like there were a few groups of guests staying together, and they dominated much of the pool, using it to play football, or to just throw each other in and out of the water even though there are no diving signs. The groups consisted of adults and teenage children; perhaps a school sports team or something of the like. This situation, combined with the undesirable fact that your hotel does not have a lifeguard on duty, made it very uneasy for as family with children to feel comfortable having the children play in the water with all the ruckus going on. Many were using the pool slide standing up as they went into the water. I have stayed at many hotels with slides, etc and there is usually a lifeguard on duty to prevent any dangerous conditions or situations from occurring. Also, the 2nd smaller pool was not of much help since it was outdated and too small, plus it appeared to still be heated water in it in the middle of June’s hot 90+ days, which seems a bit odd. The playground really should not even be mentioned as an amenity. It is far off in he distance with only one piece of equipment that had a slide. The parking lot is not designed to accommodate the guests who would like to be closer to the building that they are staying in. Many nights we would have to park very far and it is not desirable when traveling with children and having to walk a far distance to get back to the room. We clearly were not very satisfied with our stay at this hotel. This hotel really put a damper on our entire trip.Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!.Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes "just like" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is "natural" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to "optimize" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's "optimized" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to "optimize." (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under "Todd O'Connor". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by "Todd O'Connor" and under Alio "Alio"s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio "Alio" confirming the fake identity.)Yes it's true, New York City's hotel rooms are at times on the small side. It's also true to say that at times, even the best hotels can disappoint a jet lagged, tired guest. And yes, it's also fair to say that at times, hype can get the best of us. The Mercer was full so I tried my luck at the Soho Grand. My first and last stay at the Soho Grand combined a tiny cookie-cutter room with completely hopeless customer service and a feeling that the hype brings many first timers and few repeat customers - but as they say, "fools and money...." Location: Great for Soho, not as good as the Mercer, but most of the commercial fun in Soho and surrounds is within walking distance and travel to the hotel from the aiport is easy. The Checkin: Lets face it, the price of top-line hotel rooms has skyrocketed all over the world in the last four years. In some cases spending the money is a joy and in others you feel completely abused. After negotiating my way through the six porters and doorman all of whom were doing nothing but their hair, I entered through the dim, urban lobby and signed my life away on a room rate of a purely insulting $780 per night - good thing I have two kidneys, one is now for sale... This was only after "Sascha" (yes, how typical) had finished her flirtatious interlude with an elderly gentlemen while keeping five guests waiting in line. Conclusion: Checkin is a glamor job fielded by 'trendy', slightly clueless & unprofessional staff who are a touch on the rude side. In short, these guys are glorified cashiers ringing the till and gelling their hair. You get none of the 'chop-chop' and impressive attention to detail from more professional outfits here. The staff want to spot a celebrity so that they're 'with it' everyone else is chopped liver. So having established that the first impression was basically a joke and having my expectation for the room 'managed down' well, we headed upstairs... The Room: Fortuntely there was an area near the ceiling where a piece of rope would have supported my body weight - such was the disappointment. This room looked like somewhere depressed single dudes come to die, or where hookers come to do trade. Cheap, Best Western setup. $780 for a Deluxe King room bought us a (truly) miniscule bathroom, a dirty carpeted floor, a few cheap lamps and bedside tables, a flat screen TV that didn't work, scuffed walls and a very mean little bed. My heart sank as I surveyed the room as I was truly hoping for something special given the great location and price. Strangely, about one quarter of the floor area was taken up a closet like installation which stuck out from the wall, this enroached on the already small room and increased the sense of tight containment - alas I felt like a Soho cockroach in a glass jar. I called down to reception to see if we were given the right room category. After the phone was left on the desk for 3 minutes while the attendant checked (god knows what in that amount of time) I was informed that I had actually been upgraded. Too tired to bother with sarcasm, I hit the shower. Bathroom: Worth a special mention here as a fantastic bathroom can easily make a room and a stay that much more special. In this case, small, cheap & nasty says it all. After 5 seconds in the bathroom I had visions of a mean little hotel baron dressed as the little man with a top hat from Monopoly screaming at his managers 'cut all costs and maximize profits!'. There were no toileteries other than three little bottles of super new age "we hurt no monkeys making this product" body gel and shampoo. The toilet seat was off its hinges. No shower cap, no cotton buds, no bath slippers, only 1 little robe, no cotton wool, no comb, none of the regular things you rarely use, but find comfort in being there and make you feel just a litte bit special. On the plus side, the shower over bath had good water pressure - little problem though, if you have a high pressure shower, make sure you have drainage that can cope with it. Sure enough, after 30 seconds, the bathtub was 3/4 full and I was pretending to be a vietnamese farmer wading through monsoonal rice paddies - "Diddy Mao!" I called this one down to housekeeping and they informed me that in fact the drainage was fine, it wasn't broken and that it was normal - clearly American Idol was mesmerizing that evening as it seemed no one wanted to work for the guests (If only my Doctor could give me an over the phone checkup like this...) Oh by the way and yes you guessed it, the plastic shower curtain (yes plastic) did cling to my body and ofcourse, there was mould around the edges of it. Rather unfortunately, the power outlets DID have safety switches so dropping the hair dryer into my rice paddy bath did not kill me. Truly a shame by this point. The food: Did not trust the kitchen after seeing dirty knives and forks, very wilted lettuce and tired looking food. In short, unimaginative and awful scrapings from Soho gutters. Enough said. Concierge: A really simple job here. Concierge (yes with the by-now-customary five person queue at his/her desk) points towards the shops "over yonder". Anything else forget it. These guys just don't care and don't have a clue compared to switched on concierge desks like The Peninsula in mid town and The Mercer in Soho. Once again for this place, the emphasis on hiring young (and cheap), trendy looking staff comes wayyy ahead of hiring competent people. Conclusion: Checkout said it all to me. Once again a queue of 5 people and a 10 minute wait standing in the lobby. No "we'll be just a minute" or "thanks for waiting, how can I help you". Far from it. They just took the money and offered very little in return. This place is basically a honey trap; first timers and the curious will go and rarely return. Suckers with no appreciation for what service and quality actually is will surely come back. Value for money was non-existant, staff totally hopeless and too few of them, almost no efficiency, dirty scuffed walls and cheap looking rooms supposedly covered up by an expensive fit out downstairs and trendy kids playing "hotelier" for a few years before moving into the media or arts world. Burn this dump to the ground, collect the insurance check and build something that gives guests a feeling of excitment, value and slick prestige. The tradition of Soho has given alot of its sould away to commercialism over the years, the least such commercialism can do then is to honor such a special part of the world by attempting to enchant its guests, not pillage them. Management clearly has alot of work to do here. Oh yes, getting a cab to the airport took 45 minutes despite the six doormen/porters/concierges milling around the outside. Prognosis: Marginally preferable over a park bench and newspapers...I would get more joy smoking bad weed with the $100 bills I used to pay for this place... Where instead: Book the Mercer. Great food, Great location, relliable, big rooms, great bathrooms, smart concierge, smooth checkin/out. Can't go wrong. If The Mercer is full, try Soho House. If no joy there, try a new one called The Bowery.Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!.Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes "just like" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating.

First of all, they double booked us. We had left a 2 bedroom apartment to move over to 39 suites to stay in a different part of London for the 2nd week of our stay. We booked the 1 bedroom apartment at 39 suites 2 days before we left through late rooms and I left my mobile number in the comments field for them to please call me if there were any problems. I heard nothing. So, we turned up with our copious amount of luggage in a taxi and my husband spent a good hot and sweaty 5-10 mins unpacking it onto the porch at number 39. I went into reception- which is situated at number 43 next door holding the baby and trying to contain the 3 year old. The taxi left. I was then informed that it was a computer mistake, they didn’t know why and it wasn’t their fault and there was nothing they could do. Blank “we don’t give a cr*p” looks. They also used the language barrier (they were all Polish or something similar) as an excuse for not helping. I was nearly in tears as we were a family with 2 young children in the middle of London a long way from home (Australia) and she was basically telling me “sorry you have to go elsewhere”. I think as I looked so upset (and also mentioned “trip advisor”) they decided they could get us a room that was big enough for us after all... a suite. However it was too small to fit the cot and the luggage in as well as the double and single beds. So no good! So then they said we could have (reluctantly) a room in their “new apartments” on Inverness terrace (number 43), which were “much nicer and bigger” and you can walk there. Yeah right. We had so much luggage after travelling the UK for 6 weeks (this was our last few days before flying out of Heathrow when we checked out)... and the children to carry and even though it was the next street, we still had to pay a fortune to cab it over there and ask the cab driver to help us again to unload. Luckily a cab pulled up outside to drop some other poor visitor off and I asked him to move us over. I must say that there was no offer of financial help with the taxi or a refund at any time during our stay for their mistake and all the things that happened next.... In fact our credit card was CHARGED (with no consent from us) an extra 55 pounds for checking out at 2pm instead of 12pm on the day we left, as we were madly trying to pack to go to Heathrow and had the kids to look after and just weren’t organised. We didn’t want to stay there until 2pm (we had hoped to get out and do something else in London )– so it wasn’t done on purpose – but they insisted on charging us as there was someone checking in. I doubt that very much as the room they had put us into wasn’t even ready for visitors to stay in! So on that last day, I was in tears from the stress as they kept ringing about how late we were and to hurry up (both children were unhappy and crying) and on the last call they said they were going to charge us for taking so long to leave. All this after we didn’t get into the room until half a day late on that first day - due to them! We didn’t bother to complain, just tried to forget the stress and stay out a lot (that was why we were there after all). The new room was just as small but brand new. So new in fact that the bathroom tiles weren’t finished and none of the appliances fitted. The promised WIFI wasn’t being installed until a later date and we had workmen checking the electrics etc. We had pots and pans but alas, no cooktop! We had a small fridge and a kettle, but no microwave or washer (we had paid for all these things originally as we had a baby and bottles to organise) PLUS a breakfast every day that wasn’t available at this new address! When we were refused extra pillows – I had taken two pillows from the empty guest room next door as my request had been ignored and we only had one each...then they had been taken back by the cleaner - it was the final straw and I rang and tried to complain. However it turned into a messy shouting match as I had to ring there on my mobile phone as the room phone wasn’t yet connected to reception – and so I asked them to please call me back. They were VERY rude about it and when they called back I tried to explain nicely why I had asked them to call back (mobile charges/phone in room not connected etc) but the receptionist just didn’t (wouldn’t) get it and it turned into a horrible “we don’t understand, are you complaining about the phone???” idiotic conversation. I finally got somebody else on the line and tried to explain I just wanted some pillows (!!!) and when she said NO, this is not something we provide, I really did lose it... I said how we were easy going Aussies and didn’t normally like to complain, but this was the final straw after everything they had put us through and how we had just wasted a day at a Laundrette and an Internet Cafe as these services were not provided after we had paid for them, but the new person was just as rude and ignorant and told me to email her manager and tried to give me the email address! I ended up shouting at her in frustration, “but we have no internet here!!!” .... again she kept using the language barrier as an excuse to be rude – and I hung up the phone in tears again. On the day of check out I tried to explain that we needed more time but was told we couldn’t have it. I asked what we could do with our luggage until we had to leave for Heathrow and she said nothing. So it became very very stressful. Finally my husband rang back and she was very nice and said Ogh yes your wife asked me earlier and I didn;t understand. You can leave your luggage here at number 43. So she had thought about how rude she was to me , but my husband couldn’t face trying to get it all around to the next street, or paying for a cab to take it only to get it later, so we ended up taking a chance and leaving it at the bottom of the stairs. There was no elevator (as we were told there would be when accepting the room). I can honestly say the second half of our stay in London was ruined by their rude attitude and lack of care for our situation. There was much more that happened but I am upset even just writing this and think I have written enough to give you an idea... At one time I actually said “you are so rude I can’t believe it!”... they just honestly did not care. If you wonder why we didn’t move... it was because there was no way they would give us a refund as their attitude was that we had got it cheap already through late rooms and so we should just put up with it all and be grateful.... we had actually extended our flights and paid for that to stay 5 days longer in London and so just decided to put up and shut up – just as they wanted us to... But I seriously believe I almost have post traumatic stress from these people, so please, save yourself the heartache and stay away!I recently stayed at the Town and Country Hotel for a conference, and I absolutely will never willingly set foot here again; in fact, I'm also recommending to my employer that we never schedule another seminar there. I hadn't read any reviews whatsoever about the place before heading there, so I didn't have any preconceived notions about what I would find, other than the pictures on the hotel's website. Needless to say, the hotel is completely unacceptable as a business destination. So, where to begin... * Accommodations The room we stayed in was in one of the hotel's two towers, known as the Regency. The hotel was decrepit. Everywhere you look, paint is scraped and chipped, lightbulbs are burnt out (and allowed to stay that way), windows have dirt in the corners, there are dings in the walls and door jambs, and other such problems. Our room itself has obviously not been updated since the late 80's, to include the comforter, which was faded and frayed. The bathroom is lit by two dim bulbs, which is fine, since brighter light would have drawn even more attention to the stained bathtub, yellowed and peeling grout, and rusty hinges on the door. The door itself looks like it has been repeatedly urinated on, as it is streaked yellow. The air conditioning in our room was so pitiful that we ran it non-stop from the time we arrived to the time we left, and it was never able to bring the room temp below 72Âº. It was also unable to remove the mugginess from the air. We slept with the window open the first night, but, sad to say, our room faced the San Diego Herald-Tribune loading docks, so at 3:30 AM we were assailed with the crash of tractor-trailers backing up to receive shipments of newspapers. The window stayed closed after that. The grounds were beautiful, with rose bushes everywhere, and arbors, trellises, and cute little architectural touches in abundance. Of course, many of those touches, such as ornamental scrollwork, were straight from Home Depot and simply glued in place and painted; they were often askew or chipped and peeling. It was the equivalent of adding as much garnish to a dinner plate as possible to try and hide the fact that the main course was only so much boiled shoe-leather. In addition to everything else, our toilet stopped flushing on the second day. After we called maintenance to fix it, it wouldn't stop flushing. It's feast or famine at the Town & Country. Speaking of famine... * Food Business travelers and convention-goers are usually on a time crunch, as they have only so much time to eat and then be back at the next session or class. The food service at the hotel was so slow that a number of us had to skip meals or eat cold cuts from the deli; when you have only an hour and it takes 40 minutes to get just your drinks, there is a problem. The food was also sub-par; the breakfast buffet at the Terrace Cafe is to be avoided at all costs. The food is cold, rubbery, and of a quality well below that of most fast-food places. The ribs at Kelly's Steakhouse were overdone and dried out, as was the BBQ chicken; the only thing worth eating was the appetizer. Charlie's Bar & Grill was agonizingly slow and overpriced; $13 hamburgers and expensive sodas can quickly eat up your per-diem allowance. * Connectivity As a business traveler, it is essential to stay connected to the office, and Internet access is a key part of that for anyone operating in the 21st century. Here, too, the Town and Country was a let-down. With no wired access, you are forced to purchase ($3 an hour or $10 for 24 hours) wi-fi access through a vendor called LodgeNet. However, the access was so spotty that I was unable to reliably check email, and had to spend over ninety minutes on the phone with LodgeNet tech support to even get connected. * Staff The front-office staff were professional to the point of being brusque, but I only had to deal with them rarely. The waitstaff at Kelly's were utterly clueless, even to the point of failing to unlock the front door on time (we had to go in through the lounge and then tell them that the door was still locked). The waitstaff at Charlie's were arrogant and ignorant of the needs of the customers. The only two places I found excellent staff were at the Trellises restaurant and the in the housekeeping staff. At Trellises, both Angelica and Jesus, and a third gentleman whose name I didn't catch, were charming and responsive, and the food was excellent. As for the housekeeping staff, they did an excellent job with what they had to work with, and our housekeeper took extra special care with my boys' stuffed animals and even hung our wet swimsuits back up after having cleaned the bathroom. * Conclusions Overall, the front-line staff are doing the best they can in the absence of involved and commited top management, which may either be uninterested or incapable of improving the place. The Town and Country has the feeling of a sinking cruise liner; the band is still playing, but the ship is getting lower and lower in the water, and it is only a matter of time before it slips beneath the waves. Unless it is saved by a rescuer with an infusion of cash and competence, the Town and Country does not have much longer to live. I have already sent a note to our central education office (of a government agency with 160,000 employees) asking them to avoid scheduling us at this hotel in the future.We had a great time in Playa and absolutely loved our vacation. But Mosquito Beach Hotel .. that's a different story. Before i start my lenghty review, let me tell you who I travelled with, so you can have a better perspective of what we were expecting from this hotel. I went there with my bf , my brother and 3 of his closest friends. We are all in our early 30's, we are all pretty active, loved great food and wine, we are into travelling to luxurious and exotic locations, as well as budget destinations, we love to rest but also to party and hang out with other peeople, and we have travelled pretty much all over the world. All of this makes me think that the people who loved Mosquito Beach is because they do not know what service level means, or are bedazzled by the description of the hotel in their website or just thought they stayed in a so called chic exclusive place ... but let me tell you, MB is none of the above. Where to start? * Rooms: My boyfriend and I booked a White Sand (partial ocean view, Bvlgary ammenities, plasma TV, kind size bed, beautiful italian furniture, spacious room, balcony, etc .. the list is long) what we got NO PARTIAL OCEAN VIEW, but a garden view (beware, ALL WHITE SAND ROOMS are located in the same building and NONE has ocean view, not even some of the 700 USD master suites have ocean view !!!!!) When we complaint, they said, this is "partial ocean view, you can walk to the beach from here and see it through the gardens". We got an obscure, and not chic atmosphere, pretty disfunctional room, no bed side tables, no cabinets to store your clothes, not enough hangers, not enough light, (not even for make up or male's shaving processes) the whole room smelled like urine because of the humiddity (they didn't built it properly) and the "beautiful wooden floors" were so cheap that they cracked open in both, our terrace and inside the room just by walking on it !!!! The "art pieces" weren't art at all (they paint it themselves and hang it on the walls!!!), the italian furniture ... we found the place where they built them near Playa del Carmen!!! As for the ammenities, they provided us with shampoo, gel de douche and one soap (for both the sink and shower), so when you ask for more soap, it's a big deal (since they are Bvlgari, and they dont want to "waste" them ..) and they WONT gave us conditioner nor lotion, nor any of the other ammenities and if u forgot your tootbrush or something else, good luck on the store pal!! And this is a 368 - 460 USD room !!! My brother and his friends all booked Sunrise rooms (the descriptions were almost the same, except that there were double beds instead of king size) what they got was a tinny room with two single beds (where in the world, when you book a double room you get individual beds rather than double beds? nowhere but Mosquito Beach!!! and for 312-390 USD) and a tinny TV plasma and the same problems we found in our room.... Later on, my brother decided to check out an upgrade to a Brezze room (aprox 40 USD more) just to find out that it was EXACTLY HIS SAME room, but with a king size bed .... * Food - absolutely awful and way overpriced. The waiters are rude too and expect a lot of tip. The minibar is pretty overpriced as well. The restaurant and room service only runs from 7:30 am to 4:30 pm, so beware of this .. * Beach club - who has black day beds on the beach ???? because it's chic??? what about comfort? what about the fact you're frying your skin on those? shouldn't those be white or so??? the beach club IS PACKED !!!! not enough day beds for all customers AND they rent those for customers outside of the hotel. One of the main purposes we decided to stay at MB was because of such exclusive luxurious beach club .. well you can stay somewhere else and still have access to it !!! (MB is one of the ONLY hotels in Playa that allows non-customers to enjoy its beach club) Actually there are plenty of hotels that have beach clubs next to MB, and are less crowded. The beach itself wasn't what we expected, since it was destroyed a few years back after Hurricane Wilma and it's not a white sand beach anymore, but you can still find some spots that aren't as bad as MB's beach is. * Pool area: absolutely small, and packed. * Construction: they were providing maintenance INSIDE the hotel the ENTIRE time of our vacation .. fixing doors, painting ceilings and walls, welding a roof, etc .... even in our terrace!!! (one morning we woke up by this terrible noise just to find a guy in our private terrace welding something), when we complaint, management said: no worries, they will only work on it today and tomorrow !!!! [-]!!!! * Concierge service: completely unexistant. * Parking for rental cars: unexistant as well. * Gym/Sport facilities: unexistant. * Airport transfers: Beware. When i booked it, they were very anal about getting every detail for both flights, and since i wasn't sure about the departure information, or whether we were going to need it, they advice me to book the round service with the premise that i could cancel later the return transfer or modify the information, and when i tried to do so with 3 days in advance they gave me a simply NO, you have to pay for it entirely, and no changes are allowed. * Management obviously doesn't know what they are doing, and they are only ripping people off and taking advantage of their location. But the worse is that whenever they screw up, they don't even apologize !!!! We were bothered in two occasions about huge bills (1,000 US and 600 USD) that we didn't know what they were coming from !!!! and had to spend some time clarifying such. Inconvenient hassle you don't need when on vacation .. * Beware of the exchange rate !!!! Most places have it between 13 and 13.5 pesos for a dollar. This place is 14, but the tricky part is that they charge your bill in dollars, and in order to avoid this you have to pay in US dollars cash, otherwise, they will convert your bill in dollars to pesos at THEIR exchange rate, and then charge it to your credit card. My advice is to stay in one of the following places: (much better, and not such a major rip off, with access to the same beach) * Corto Maltes condos * The Royal Playa del Carmen * Hotel Real Playa * Pueblito Escondido Hotel OR if you wanna splurge and keep the same level of service that you expect from a 500 USD room hotel then stay at: * Mayakoba Fairmont * Grand Velas Riviera Maya * Secrets (for honey mooners) Good luck!So to start things off, right when we checked into the hotel. the staff did not sound too welcoming as we checked in at 1am and our check in was supposed to be at 3pm. I have no clue why it matters when we check in as we had already paid but nonetheless that was nothing compared to what was to come. The rooms were clean and had a 32 inch flat screen LG tv. The remote however did not work and when we told front desk about the problem they claimed they had no batteries. We just stayed the first night inside our hotel drinking a couple of beers. The next night everything was fine. We had no issue with the hotel. Then on our last night of stay at the hotel which was a Friday night. We noticed that there was a strange looking dude standing outside our room with a black toque on. He looked rather intoxicated and we thought he was with the people next door which later turned out not to be true. He told us he was looking for a guy named John and when we told him there was no John in this room he just smiled. About 10mins later as we were leaving to go to the bar he was still outside our room which was definitely a little sketched but again we thought he was with our neighbours as we had seen him talking to them earlier. We left at 11:30pm, and came back early at 1:30am as one of my bud wanted to get money to go to the casino. We found out that our room had been robbed. I lost my laptop along with my DNG Prescription glasses which I had paid over 300$ for! My friend lost his old itouch along with 200$ cash as he had foolishly left his money on the table. The laptop was about 2 years old and probably worth around 400$ but it was not the fact that I lost the laptop but the fact that I had important information in there. Before leaving our room we had nothing to drink and chose to rather drink that night out at the bar making us all sober when we left the room. We had made sure we locked the front door when we left as we had a weird gut feeling about the sketchy individual. We also locked our back balcony door as it is rather easy to hop from one balcony to the other (like a half metre apart). We immediately informed the front desk about what had happened, and he told us that there was no reason to call the police and that the next morning the manager will be in at 10am sharp, and we may be able to get the video footage of who got into our room and go from there. Foolishly we agreed to that and the next morning me and my friend went at 10am sharp to speak to the "manager". When we went there was someone new working and he told us that the manager will not be in till monday! But our check out date was Saturday morning. The man in the front desk the day earlier had lied to us about the manager coming in for Saturday. I then quickly called the Montreal Police who said they will come asap. They came within 10mins but we did not know as the receptionist had told the police that we were staying in a different room. The police had knocked on an empty room to file the report and just as the police got into his car I had asked him if he had come to the hotel regarding a robbery. He said yes and asked why we had not opened our room! I could not believe that the front desk man had lied to the police about our room number so we do not file a police report. But then again the front desk guy may have just made a "mistake". So at the end of all this I finally submitted a police report regarding the robbery and the police informed us that they will check the camera Monday when the manager is back and give me a call when I am back in Toronto. And as if things were not bad enough they got worse. We had prepaid a $50 deposit when we first came to the hotel in the case that we damage anything. We used a prepaid MasterCard to pay. As we were leaving the front desk man took the prepaid card and stated that he had reimbursed our deposit. He gave us a receipt with it and told us that card balance is back to $50. We did not check the receipt and when we went to pump some gas with the money the balance cashier stated the card balance was 0. We called MasterCard to double check the balance and indeed it was 0. This hotel is owned by what I believe thieves. We even have a doubt that we may have been set up by the hotel staff for the robbery. However, I hate to make accusations but all the evidence makes this hotel look bad! I am probably never going to receive any of my goods back and our report will probably end up in the recycling bin. The only good about this hotel was its location and that it was clean (just the rooms and lobby) Apart from that , stay away from this hotel! ps. I have stayed at many hotels/inns before and this has been my worst experience by far! not only because I got robbed but because it seemed as though the hotel staff did not give a dam about it!Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

However, sadly, some put the cheapest ingredients that often even cause negative reactions in dogs into their products and then add flavors to make the dog want them so they continue to be bought.<br /><br />Ah, but don't take my word for it.<br /><br />First ingredient in these? Rice Flour. Not meat. Not whole wheat flour. Not brown rice flour. Rice flour...bad carb, no protein, breaks down into sugar. But it gets better. Second main ingredient? SUGAR.<br /><br />Let me repeat that. This contains mostly sugar.<br /><br />Yes they are shaped like bones and you feel like you are getting some good protein in and that they aren't like giving your pet hard candy. Naw. That's marketing. They only contain 7% protein and the protein source is derived from "dried meat by product". In other words, meat waste.<br /><br />But lets go back to sugar. You could give your dog a tablespoon of sugar each day and they would crave that too. But you will also have to pay for extra tartar scrapings from your vet which are stressful to your canine companion or have a pet lose their teeth in their later years.<br /><br />But I'm just getting started. 3rd ingredient? Wheat flour. Not whole wheat flour...processed and stripped of it's nutriotional value. Cheaper. And of no nutritional value. Cheap.<br /><br />So you think the fourth ingredient must be some protein huh? Naw, it's Propylene Glycol.<br /><br />Then powdered cellulose<br /><br />Then sodium caseinate<br /><br />but we dont want our dogs to thumb their paws up at such ingredients so natural poultry FLAVOR is then added. This is what some dog companies do, besides adding sugar, to make a product marketable...have it TASTE to the dog like it has something they need or want in it but it just be a flavoring. Then they beg for it and owners think it's great, buy more, and profit is good.<br /><br />BAD.<br /><br />Now then, let me sum this up with the warning under the feeding guide:<br />"Up to (meaning no more than) 5 sticks every week"<br />and "not suitable for puppies or dogs under 5 lbs." Yet the jumbone mini with a yorkie on the front has these ingredients and then says not to give it to small dogs! That is called a legal disclaimer should your dog develop issues from the feeding of this product. What more needs to be said?<br /><br />Yeah, you don't have those warnings about nutritional harm when you just feed your dog some good natural treats or meat.<br /><br />Animal crackers or saltwater taffy would offer your dog the same taste and ingredients for the most part as these and be cheaper.<br /><br />I take it back. The above two wouldn't have as many artificial flavors and preservatives.<br /><br />Don't buy into the hype "big meaty center"<br /><br />If by "meaty" they mean 'sugar and cellulse" then I agree...<br /><br />I so hate seeing profit over care for companion animals.<br /><br />Why did I give it 1 star? I had no choice, but afterall, If you have to go by will your dog like it? You bet! But they like chocolate too...doesn't mean they should eat it.<br /><br />I am not promoting any particular dog food or treat here...just giving my opinion (based on 5 years of study on the subject on my part) that you may wish to avoid sugar and cheap fillers for anything going into your pet. Animals are so little and dependant upon our choices for them. And, especially if you dont brush their teeth daily as most of us don't, giving them something filled with sugar and bad-carb flours is highly detrimental to thier livers, teeth, livers, kidneys, and full canine systems.<br /><br />Not to mention the artificial fillers and dried meat by products. Meat waste can have very bad things in it. It's not suitable for human consumption (these include the parts thrown away that may be diseased or tumerous. Yes, seriously, these ARE allowed to be used in dog food.)<br /><br />And don't even consider the vitamins added. When made into a processed dog food of this type, they get baked out at such high temperatures used in the processing. So consider that teeninsy bit added at the very end of the ingredient list null and void after processing.<br /><br />Buy em a real soup bone or give them carrots or NATURAL wet dog food or cottage cheese for a treat.<br /><br />Dogs don't do well on things like this and it can cost you more in their health than the savings on buying a less expensive brand.<br /><br />I love em (pets) too much not to review this honestly...And as SOON as one person is done, she asked to pick up the plate immediately.My fiancée and I both love London. It’s versatility, it's thriving night-life, it's enormous shops, it's tranquil parks and much more... It must be Europe’s grandest city. For the final two night of our travel through all of the UK, eventually leading to London, we decided to stay in a somewhat more luxurious hotel than the previous hotel/motels we stayed in. We were exhausted and we needed a good place to rest, located somewhere from were could easily explore the city. Choosing for the Central Park Hotel (which is supposedly of 3 star quality) was one of the WORST decisions we made throughout our many travels. As we came in, there was a giant queue in front of us, we needed to wait for more than 30 minutes before being told that we couldn’t check in any time before three o’clock. After three o’clock, my fiancée and I went to visit the Hyde Park in the meanwhile, a chubby lady who seemed to be inseparably surrounded by a strikingly strong odour of sweat and being relentlessly sulky towards us, said she wasn’t yet capable to check us in for a twofold reason: there was no room available, there was no booking made (?!?). After I showed her my conformation and her inquiring at the reservation office, it took another 30 minutes for her to return, she admitted that it was simply not posted correctly in the system she worked from. So we where finally checked in. She said breakfast wasn’t included in the rate, but after I showed her my conformation again, she annoyingly admitted it was. We got four, clearly already used, vouchers. The roomed that was given to us was remarkably tiny, imagine a cramp single room with a king-size bed in there, that’s how it seemed. It was clearly smaller than the rooms of cheaper hotels we stayed in during our may travels. After noticing the dust on our in our windowsill and the stains in our bath we went down again to kindly ask for another room. The lady, still the same one and the only one apparently on service, who seemed annoyed while ending her Internet chat sessions to answer my request, simply said that there were no other rooms available. If we would come back in the morning, she said literally: “Maybe one of my colleagues the other morning wants to change it for you, check it with them.” I informed her, which is true and not just a lie that suits the situation, about my fiancée’s asthma, and that my fiancée couldn’t stay in a room as dirty as the one we were allocated in, she simply replied, “That’s your problem, sir.” The other morning though, after not-enjoying the cheap breakfast (only spongy croissant with some jam, no, jelly with a colour, we asked again, and still the receptionists weren’t able, some maybe not even capable, of changing our room. My fiancée didn’t sleep all night because of her condition, but I didn’t feel it was appropriate using this in the argument, until everything resulted in me speaking to an uncaring, uninterested, bad tempered front-office manager. Still nothing happened. My fiancée brought two towels from home. We were planning to sleep in hotels, but you never know for sure whatever your come across (like what happened in the CPH). After we asked for two new towels, the original ones had suspicious stains on them, we were presented with two greasy new ones. My fiancée therefore decided to use one of her own. In the morning, after coming back disappointed from asking (applying seems a better fit term) for a new room, we found that our towels had been removed by housekeeping that was already cleaning everything. After calling reception, where they put us through to concierge, where they asked us to call housekeeping, where I was put on hold before being put through to a lady, we were explained that the towels had already been taken downstairs by mistake. In the evening after seven, we noticed they weren’t delivered back, so I informed at the concierge desk. They didn’t know, they asked the duty manager, a kind gentleman from India, who would ask housekeeping again. The next morning even after check-out they didn’t find anything, they would just take another look which raised the suspicion the didn’t look at all. We left without them, leaving our address at the concierge desk, but nothing was sent home. It is not about losing the towels, we might have thrown them away in the end anyway, but it’s about the hotel fetching guest’s possessions and not even taking an effort to return them to there righteous owners! The hotel is horribly dirty and cheap for a ridiculous high rate. This, on itself, would not even be all to bad if it wasn’t for all staff being incredibly incapable and insolent (including management, especially the front-office manager) in there approach towards guests. DON’T GO THERE!!Decided in March 07 to visit Las Vegas for a one night stay in May 07 for business and pleasure. I booked two rooms at TheHotel at Mandalay Bay for $179 each. This rate was lower than other travel websites and lower than the hotel's direct website for the specific date I needed. In addition, this rate included: 4pm late checkout, two $20 breakfast certs per room, potential for an upgraded suite if available and a $100 spa credit for services for each room. WOW. When my associate and I arrived at TheHotel at 10 am, the bell desk took my two suitcases to a storage room. The front desk rep advised one room was available and he confirmed that I would have a 4pm late checkout. I was provided with the keys to my room, my associate was advised to call the front desk later in the day to see if his room was ready. I provided the front desk rep with my luggage tag and asked him to send the suitcases up to the room. We both went to my room for about fifteen minutes, we then decided to leave, even though the luggage had not arrived. I wrote out a large note to the bell desk employee and left the note along with a $5 tip on the table. In addition, I left my itinerary for the flight the next day, my dinner reservation confirmation sheet, breakfast certs, minibar key and some other paperwork on the side table next to the couch. My associate left his duffel bag containing his clothing in the room. I also placed several of my credit cards into his duffel bag. We left the room and returned at 3pm. When we arrived back in the room, my associates duffel bag was missing-including my credit cards, along with the $5, and all other paperwork. Furthermore, my two pieces of luggage were not in the room. I called the front desk immediately and was transferred to security. After a brief investigation (10 minutes) I was advised that the room was cleaned and that his duffel bag was in Lost and Found. I was obviously concerned that my credit cards were missing and asked for an explanation as to why the attendant had cleaned the room when it was clearly occupied and we had checked in. The response was, it "appeared to be an error." I asked that my luggage be delivered to the room along with my associate's duffel bag. I'd contacted a concierge service months prior to the trip to set up a special dinner reservation for 5pm that night. It was now 3:15 pm. At 4pm, I called the front desk again to find out why we had still not received my luggage, his duffel bag, replacement breakfast certs and his room key. At 4:15 pm, my luggage was delivered along with his duffel bag and his room key, but no breakfast certs. We were wearing resort attire and needed to change into business casual after showering, etc. It was obvious we weren't going to make dinner at 5pm since it was at least a 15 minute cab ride, not including the wait and we were still in shorts/tshirts. I called the concierge service and fortunately they were able to move the time back to 6pm. A bit of a hassle on my part stemming from TheHotel's error and very slow service. We went out to dinner, when we returned, I had to call the front desk again for the breakfast certs. The Breakfast the next morning was wonderful, two of the four certs were used and greatly appreciated. The next day, we both utilized the spa credits toward several services. My associate left TheHotel about noon to catch his flight. I called the front desk as a courtesy, since a large event was in town, to advise that his room was now vacant and to verify that I had a 4pm ck out. It was confirmed. I went out for a while and returned to my room at about 3pm to gather my luggage for my 440pm flight. My two keys did not work in my door. I was very concerned that I was going to have another bad experience at TheHotel and I was under time pressure since airlines advise arriving at the Las Vegas airport at least two hours prior to departure. I called the front desk from a hallway courtesy phone (I was on the 29th floor, a walk to the front desk would have consumed several minutes and when I walked through the lobby earlier, there were at least 25 people in line to check in). I was advised that even though I had a 4pm ckout, the computer system had automatically checked me out. I needed to wait for security to deliver me a new key. Based on my hour and fifteen minute wait yesterday, I was very upset and concerned that I was going to miss my flight (I'd booked a first class seat and didn't want to be assigned to coach-or lose my seat on this Memorial Day holiday weekend if I ck'd in late). Plus, I had other travel arrangements for the next day. I waited 15 minutes for security to arrive with a new key, a front desk staff member also arrived at my room. I expressed my concerns about my flight and the previous day's several incidents. They made no attempt to offer expedited transport to the airport and provided me with a basic apology for being locked out. I hustled to TheHotel taxi line-without stopping for a copy of my bill even though I need it for my tax records because the front desk line was again very long and I was in a rush; fortunately I made it to the airport on time. The room rate and package of benefits was really great; unfortunately, TheHotel's many service related issues created several stressful situations. Even though the I enjoy the décor of TheHotel, I won't return for quite some time since my overall impression is that they have many service glitches. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have stayed in properties before that have had some negative TripAdvisor reviews,and have had no issues during our stay. Not the case this time... As I have stated in my other reviews, we are raising a 9 year old grandson. He wanted to see Las Vegas. My husband and I have been there several times and we knew that there were lots of things for him to enjoy (Hoover Dam, the Fremont laser show, the top of the Stratosphere, the Eiffel Tower, M &M World, the Bellagio fountains, the Habitat at the Flamingo, etc..). We also assumed that the Excalibur is family friendly. After all, there is the Fantasy Faire game room, the dinner show where you eat with your hands, the 4 pools, the whole castle themed thing... So we booked 2 rooms last December (3 months ago) for his March spring break. We reserved-and paid a deposit for-2 non smoking rooms with a wide screen TV and a view of the strip. We wanted non smoking as my sister and my grandson both have some problems when exposed to a large amount of smoke. Our flight did not arrive until 10 pm. When we checked in, we were told that all the non smoking rooms were gone. I said that I reserved these rooms 3 months prior. His reply was, "it does not matter how far out you booked your rooms. It is first come-first served." He told us that if we stopped back at the desk after 12 noon the next day, we could get our requested rooms. He also said that the hotel staff would help us move our belongings to our new rooms. It was really late by that time, and we felt as though we had no other option. We got to our 2 smoking rooms on the smoking floor. Not all of the key cards worked, so we had to make another trip downstairs to get new key cards. The view from both rooms was the roof of the casino below. All we could see was the red and blue turret towers. No view of the strip at all. We waited till noon the next day and asked to be moved to the rooms that I had requested months ago. We were told that they had 2 non smoking rooms ready and I asked if they both had views of the strip. I was told "yes". We were told that we had just enough time to go back to our current rooms and get our suitcases out of the rooms as our key cards would momentarily be deactivated to our 2 current rooms. There was no mention of assistance from the hotel staff to help move us. We hurried as quickly as humanly possible to our current rooms. Guess what, folks? The key cards to the rooms that our belongings were in had already been deactivated! We were furious! We were on our way back downstairs to talk to-who -knows- who in order to get into our rooms so we could get our things out. We spotted a hotel staff member on our floor. We explained our situation and pleaded with him/her to let us into our rooms. This person kept telling us to go back downstairs and talk to supervision until he/she saw the desperation in our faces. We were let in only if we promised not to tell as he/she was afraid of being fired! Fired? This is the only person since our arrival that was willing to go above and beyond and they were afraid of getting fired? How sad...We offered him/her some cash for saving us, but it was refused. What an awesome employee to help us out even when it meant their job was on the line.... We finally get in to our non smoking rooms only to discover that only one of the rooms had a strip view. The other still had a view of the casino roof and the red and blue turret towers. Only now with this view you could also see old hotel room furniture stored in an area on the roof and also a "punching bag" that had been hung-for staff use, I guess...Yeah, nice view. Shame on the staff member that just plain lied when stating that both non smoking rooms had views of the strip. We were so tired of taking that long walk back in order to get what we asked for that we just gave up and took the rooms. But wait, it gets even better..We spent some time at the pool and wanted drinks from the bar. The line at the bar kept getting longer and longer. The bartender was refusing to wait on anyone. Instead, he was gathering up bottles and wiping down the bar area for closing time. It was still a good while before the bar was to close for the evening. The line kept increasing and he just kept ignoring the customers. Finally another customer became very upset and told the bartender that his job was to wait on customers as long as there was one in front of him. I could not agree more. The gathering of beer bottles, mixers, and liquors can wait until the customers have all been taken care of or until after the bar closes-not before. Finally another bartender came out, but he was not much more motivated than the other one. We actually heard one of the bartenders say, "There are ticked off people here today. But I really and truly do not care." Yep, that was obvious,buddy. I am a former night club owner and I would have fired any bartender that had that attitude. And as for the bar/restaurant inside known as "Dick's Last Resort"-that place needs to be moved away from the path that leads to the rooms. As we walked by the place with our grandson (and there were a large number of other children on spring break walking by there as well) there was a young inebriated man and woman in the midst of an obscene and truly embarrassing act. I realize that it was also spring break for college students as well, but for Pete's sake, clean it up, Excalibur!! If you really see nothing wrong with what was happening in there, then please put up a wall so the rest of don't have to watch what bordered on "porn!" Family friendly hotel? I think not...... After our initial experience, we felt that we could just not spend our hard-earned money in the Excalibur restaurants, gift shops casino, etc.. So we spent it elsewhere on the strip. We felt as though "we really mattered" to the staff everywhere we went except the Excalibur. Customer service is what it is all about and my personal opinion is that this hotel just doesn't understand that. Even our 9 year old grandson picked up on the fact that the service was not all that it should be. I know that this "vent" won't make a difference to the hotel management, but I want the TripAdvisor readers to know about our experience. Will we visit Vegas again? Yes, indeed! Will we stay at Excalibur again? No way!!!My husband and I were just married at Caesar's palace Las Vegas on February 21, 2005. The wedding service and cordinators were great but our stay at Caesar's was very disappointing and terrible. We arrived at the hotel on Sunday February 20th, 2005. We arrived at the valet area around 12:30 p.m., the valet attendants were a little friendly, but could have been better. When we went to check-in we only waited for about 10 mins. We thought that our suite would not be ready until 3 or so. The front desk person said that there was not a room ready, and that it would not be ready until at least 5p.m. I told him that check-in time is 3, and that I needed it to be ready by 4. We were scheduled to have our wedding party, up to our suite at 4. He said o.k. and gave me a number to call back in a little while to see if the room was ready. That was fine, we had planned to go have lunch with our family and friends at the Rio at 1:00pm. Well as we were leaving I sat down for a few minutes, because I had just drove 7 hours to get to Las Vegas. The front desk gentleman (Adam) came to find us, he said that they had a room ready, and we could check-in and go look at it. He said that we could have the bell-men take up our belongings while we were gone at lunch. We thought everything would be fine. Well we got our room keys, and went up to suite 482 in the Roman Tower. When we steped in, lets say that it was not pleasant. It had 2 nice marble steps to go in to the roon, and a huge marble floor once you stepped in. After that the first thing we saw, was a huge stain in the carpet, that looked almost the color of I don't know what. I thought, well maybe they can cover it with a rug. Then there was a huge round table, that was proble nice when they first got it, as you got closer it had a lot of big gashes in it. A lot of the lights and lamps did not work, and there was actually broken glass from a light bulb on a table, not to mention the broke off bulbs that were still in some of the lamps. When you walked to the right where the bar was, the marble bar was very dirty, and stained. My husband went in to the master bathroom, he went to turn on the water, and the fixture came off. Well my friend that was with us called down to the front desk and talked to Adam. He was quick to help, and still very nice. Well by this point we had to call our families and friends to tell them that we would not make it to lunch, and we still had not ate that day. Adam took us to the same suite on the 5th floor # 582 to give it a look. My husband and our two friends looked it over, to make sure non of the other problems were in this suite. It was good, so we said o.k. They brought our luggage and things up, and then we left to get some lunch, finally around 2:30p.m. So, we had already delt with the hotel for 2 hours. We called our wedding party and said 4o'clock was still a go in the suite. So everyone got there while I went to pick up my sister/maid-of-honor. When we got back I had to run to the restroom, when I came out, I saw my daughter open a cabinet under the sink, then she began to scream histarically. Then she yelled" ROACH", I thought I was hearing things, and my best-friend, the god-father of my children began to chase it , and kill it. How bad is that? My friend who had already delt with the hotel people, called down to the front desk again. Whoever answered was very rude, and said that they would send someone right up. After 25 minutes, my sister took the napkin that had the roach in it to the front desk, and asked them what they would like her to do with it? The lady looked at her crazy, and grabbed it, and tossed it in the trash. Then offered a $50.00 food and beverage credit, that I already had. She continued asking my sister and friend what they wanted her to do about it, while I and the rest of our wedding party waited for the person they were sending up. When she got there, she looked quickly, and briefly, and then said I do not see anything. One of my bridesmaids asked her to check again, she said o.k., o.k. meha, I look again, very rudely. My sister and friend went to check out suite 1082, same tower. It was o.k., but I had to go down and get the new keys. So, my husband, sister, best-friend, best-man, and about 6 other friends went down to talk to a manager. Well after we asked for a manager it took about 30-40 mins before she came, and the front desk peoole kept saying, oh, they do this to us all the time. They don't worry about us or the customer waiting. Well by the time she can, I very very emotionally drained and upset. My friend had to talk to her, because I was so upset, I could not talk. My friend proseeded to tell her what we had been through all day, and that I was mordified by what I went through, and how bad it was for roaches to be in my room, and for all of our wedding party to witness it. She kept asking, what do you want me to do? Then my friend said to her, instead of asking me what I want you to do, why don't you tell me waht you are gonig to do to make it better? I guess she finally remembered how to do her job, and what she was there for, and finally offered to move us, and comp us for our last night, that we were going to have to move to a smaller room for. So, in total we spent about 7 hours dealing with our room, and all of our plans were ruined. My whole wedding party, were yelling at eachother, and upset with me. All beacause Caesar's Palace put us behind schedule. I almost did not get my marriage license in time. When I woke up in the morning, I looked like a mess, because I had been crying so much, thank god, my wedding did not start until 4:00p.m. Oh, by the way, they did not refund the rest of my cash deposit either. I put down $200.00 and only used about $90.00 of it, so they still owe me $110.00 for my deposit. To sum it all up. I do recommend the wedding chapel, it was beautiful, unfortunalty my wedding cordinator did not work that day. As for the hotel, I give it a F-, a straight failure. I forgot to mention that the valet yelled at my friend right after she picked up my car from then, even after she tipped them quite generouslly. So, my advise is go the the New York New York , MGM, Mirage, Luxor, even Imperial Palace if you want good sevice, because Caesar's is truely not a Palace fit for anyone.Scammed at the Excellence We were scammed at the Excellence Resorts in Punta Cana at their casino. The first night of our 6th year anniversary vacation, we were given 2 $5 chips as we entered the casino to initially play some blackjack. These chips were only to be used for Super Keno. So we figured, Hey, why not? This was the beginning of our nightmare and the worst vacation of our entire life. We made it up to 98 points that first night. Tim from Arkansas smooth talked us, just like Bill Clinton. I am a teacher and he told me how his sister is a teacher, too. He told us nobody ever makes it to 98 points like this (little did we know that his was a lie. The same stories are told by others who got scammed on superkenoscam.com). Our jackpot was $52,000. Anyhow, our game got closed that first night because our Bank card was apparently not swiping. Jack led me into the Casino office to call my Bank and shut the game down for approximately 1 hour. Although I was on the phone with my bank and they told me I had sufficient funds for a cash advance, the Casino claimed the card would not swipe. But, because the Casino was so nice, they would hold the game for us another night. So, the next night we went back to the casino. And what do you know? The same issue was occurring. I pulled out one ball. Oh, and what do you know it was a double! Oh great $100,000 jackpot, but or bet doubled as well. But then my card was not swiping (so they claimed). Tim even told us how he told his mother about us, the nice couple from CT about to win a big jackpot...LIE! Again, I was led into the Casino鈥檚 office. Same issue, my bank told me the funds are there, but the Casino鈥檚 VISANE T machine kept stating, CALL BANK. They told us to go to the Bank O Popular tomorrow and they would comp the Taxi ride and they鈥檇 hold the game yet another night. So, on the third day of our vacation we take a taxi to the Bank and take out a little less than $10,000 thinking if we hit a double again we would be able to cover the bet. I mean we only had to hit that 2 point ball. If we hit 98 points in one night, why couldn鈥檛 we hit one of the many point balls? Well, we now know...it was all a scam. Well, we go back the third night with cash in hand. Of course, we hit another double. OK...now we鈥檙e up $200,000. Tim was telling us how he never had a jackpot so large! So we bet again. We hit a $10.00, and then a $5.00 and then what do you know? We hit another double. Now our jackpot was up to just under $500,000. We were forced to walk away because yet again our bank card was stating call bank when the swiped it. However, I was on the phone with People鈥檚 Bank and they told me that their computers were not showing that the Casino was swiping it. This happened for approximately 1 hour. We were forced to walk away after we had invested our savings, approximately $20,000. I am so embarrassed to say it. My husband and I do not gamble. We just figured if we got 98 points that quickly we were sure to get the 2 points needed to win the jack pot. We have been saving to build our dream home and actually haven't been on a vacation since our honeymoon 6 years ago.  We now realize this entire game was a scam from day one. This is the scam...Tim would cover one of the numbers on the ball as he retrieved it. He鈥檇 read off the number, while Jack was distracting us. We didn't even see the number on the ball. The numbers aren鈥檛 printed large on the balls, like bingo. We trusted the American dealers. They manipulated the game by losing your bet on repeat numbers or when they wanted to keep you invested they鈥檇 let you win a little amount of money. There is a scam with double balls. There is scam with them turning off the machine and allowing all the balls to drop. There is a scam with them splitting up the husband and wife to call the bank. Hopefully a video may prove their guilt on the covering up the numbers on the ball when they take it out.  We complained to the Excellence Hotel management, who we think is in on this scam, and told them about what happened. They (Rafael and Jose Maria) kicked us out of their office. They told us that they needed evidence. They told us they have video surveillance of us signing for the money. We tried to explain that is not the point. So we printed out some of the stories that were written on the superkenoscam.com website regarding the scam at their hotel, even one that was recently posted on Monday, July 23rd, 2007. They didn't even want to see it or talk about this matter further. We have never been so cruelly treated by a Hotel. They are not supporting us, nor would advise us what to do. They claim the Casino is not part of the Hotel, yet Excellence employees gave us the chips and told us to play the Super Keno game. We can鈥檛 even get a straight answer out of anybody. We were even having difficulty finding out the names and numbers of the managers. We spoke with the US Embassy and I wrote a letter to the Secretary of Finance/Office of casinos in the Dominican Republic. However, when I asked the concierge to translate the letter, her boss said she couldn鈥檛 because something would get lost in translation. So, I did my best at translating the letter myself. We also wrote 3 letters/e-mails to the Excellence Hotel managers and general managers. Of course, there has been no response. The Excellence Hotel will not even warn its guests about the Super Keno scam being run inside their hotel. Rafael, Hotel manager, even told us that there were 3-4 complaints regarding the same issue and in fact a guest complained last weak about losing $21,000. So, why weren鈥檛 we warned? We were warned by the Excellence about the red/yellow/black flags on the Federal beach, why not this, inside their Hotel? Well, Rafael told us it was our Go-GO travel agent representative鈥檚 duty to warn us about the scam. So, nobody will help us! Everybody seems to pointing fingers at others. How about that the Excellence will not even warn its future guests! I know that the Excellence Hotel is in on it. If we knew there was an issue with the casino, we would have never stepped foot inside of it. I can鈥檛 believe it is all a scam that they continue to do to their guests. By the way, the food was awful! The elevator did not work and we were on the 3rd floor (they call it the 2nd). Our key card to room didn't work 3 times. Eventually, they put a new lock on door. However, the grounds are beautiful and the service staff were awesome.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess.Do not stay at this hotel!!!!! If you don’t feel like reading this entire review then the only thing you really need to know is that I would not recommend this hotel to anyone because we found a mouse in our room. Also, even if the mouse issue was taken care of, I still would not recommend this hotel to anyone based on the terrible customer service we received from the Assistant Front Desk Supervisor regarding this issue. My wife and I had booked and pre-paid for this hotel through Book-it.com for 6 nights in late May 2011. The hotel was listed on the website as 3 stars and was going for an average of $140 plus tax per night. Like many similar websites the identity of the hotel was only revealed to us after confirming the booking. We decided to take our chance considering the price was so affordable compared to other accommodations in New York City. The location was also great (Theatre district – next to Ed Sullivan Theatre, walking distance from Times Square and Central Park) and we figured if it was listed as a three star hotel it couldn’t be too bad. Some of our friends had also used the same website to book a “mystery hotel” in New York, through which they were also booked at the Ameritania, and had no problems - they said it wasn’t the greatest hotel but for only 6 nights and considering we probably wouldn’t be spending too much time in the room it was good enough. We didn’t have very high expectations for this hotel. These expectations went even lower after we read some of the reviews, however, the price was right and we were willing to put up with a less than ideal place for a few nights. We can put up with a lot…our main concern was cleanliness, mainly that there were no bed bugs. Upon arriving at the hotel I could see that the lobby and lounge area had been renovated fairly recently. It looked decent but we knew that this wouldn’t be an accurate reflection of the rest of the hotel based on the reviews that we had read. We were booked in room 215. Of course the room hadn’t been renovated yet, which explains the cheap price. On one hand I expected that we would be getting a room that hadn’t been renovated yet but based on the hotel management’s response to other customer’s complaints on this website (that renovations should be complete by May 2011) I had some hope that we would get a newly renovated room. Unfortunately, from what it looked like the renovations at this hotel wouldn’t be done for some time. It looked as though our entire floor still needed to be re-done…there were rooms with the doors left open that were completely gutted, construction material lying around, etc. I never actually saw any other guests on our floor (although I did see some contractors walking around) and it was eerily quiet which made me think we were the only ones staying on the floor. Who knows how many other floors were like this. The room wasn’t great which wasn’t a surprise. It was small (which we didn’t mind) and dark (which we also didn’t mind except for it made it hard to see if the room was cleaned properly). The first thing we did was check the mattress for any signs of bed bugs …thankfully we didn’t find anything. The floor looked like it hadn’t been vacuumed recently, the washroom stunk, and the bathtub had some hairs in it. The water pressure and temperature for the shower wasn’t consistent. Still, as we had low expectations anyways we were content with making this our home for 6 nights. It wasn’t until night number 4 that we had our encounter with the mouse. It was about 2 in the morning when my wife had heard some rustling in the garbage can and saw the mouse poke its head out. I saw it running along the wall towards the corner of the room. There are a lot of things that we are willing to put up with but having rodents running around our room is not one of them… I called the front desk to report the problem. At this point I was still willing to stay at Ameritania if they offered me a renovated room as we wanted to spare ourselves the inconvenience of having to move hotels in the middle of the night. The maintenance guy came up to our room and as he wasn’t acting surprised I figured this was a problem that he had seen before although he was adamant that he had never received any such complaints. The only other room that was available was another unfinished room directly above ours. I checked it out and it looked a little better but we didn’t take it. Front desk set up another hotel for us (Sheraton Tribeca). The Sheraton was great but it wasn’t as central and cost $330 plus tax per night. The front desk staff at Sheraton said that they had a few other guests from Ameritania transfer to Sheraton earlier in the night. The front desk guy working the late shift at Ameritania the night we checked out was fine to deal with. He was nice and seemed like he genuinely felt bad that we had to move hotels in the middle of the night. He was also the one who called around to see what other hotels were available. Unfortunately, he couldn’t deal with our refund and told us to contact the manager the next day stating that management wouldn’t be in until 3 in the afternoon. We were told that management would be advised of our issue. The following afternoon we went back to the hotel to speak with the Assistant Front Desk Supervisor. The supervisor wasn’t yet aware of our problem, which surprised me as I figured the issue would be a priority for management to deal with although, to be fair, he had just started his shift shortly before we arrived. When I explained my problem to him he initially told me that he didn’t have the authority to give me a refund and told me I had to speak to the Hotel Manager. I was disappointed that he wasn’t more willing to help out…I thought that, as a supervisor, he would make every effort to properly address a customer complaint, especially one such as this. After speaking with him for some time he finally said that he could approve a refund...which still wasn’t good enough as he said that he would only refund us for 1 and a half nights. Again he claimed that I would have to speak with the hotel manager who, of course, wouldn’t be in for a few more days and who he had no way to contact. Again, after some time he reluctantly agreed to charge for only 2 nights. He stated that we would have to contact bookit.com for the refund and only did so himself when I asked him to. I was content with this outcome although I was not happy with how long it took before he agreed to give a refund for more than 1 and a half days. Regardless of how cheap the price is and regardless of the prime location do not stay at this hotel. Even after the renovations are complete and the mouse problem is fixed I still wouldn’t stay here based on the terrible customer service from the supervisor.Bad food  FOOD:We arrived at the Bahia on Saturday, May 20 @ approx. 10:30pm. On Sunday morning we had our first meal there, which already made our stomach upset. So, my husband  I decided that we would stay away from foods that 鈥渃ould鈥?make us sick. We stayed away from Pork, Fish, Milk Products, Eggs etc鈥nd we only drank the bottled water that was in our room.We went for lunch on Wednesday, and I decided to try a hot dog for the first time there鈥?鈥漛ig mistake鈥?!!! I took one bite鈥?. It tasted so disgusting  was as raw as could be. My husband then decided to bring his back  get it cooked more. Well, a couple of hours later we started the diarrhea, it got so bad that we had to go back to our room  stay there. I felt a lot worse than my husband鈥?.I started having really bad abdominal pain, that just kept getting worse as the evening went on. At around 10:00PM, they got so bad that my husband had to call the front desk for a doctor鈥?I could barely walk at this point for how bad the pain got. They sent a resort trolley to pick us up  take me to the doctor. As soon as the doctor saw me, she could not believe how much pain I was in. So, she checked me right away  had to give me an injection to stop the pain ASAP. She then had to put me on pain killers  antibiotics because I had Travelers Diarrhea (which could cause abdominal pain, fever, chills, headaches  the obvious鈥? diarrhea) The doctor at the resort was great; she was probably the most pleasant person that I dealt with at the resort. On Friday, I was feeling better  after being put on a rice  bread diet. The doctor told me I could start eating grilled meats. That night we had reservations at the Grille restaurant, I told the waiter to please cook my steak well done because I have been sick all week, well when I received the steak 鈥渋t was burnt鈥?which was OK with me (at least I knew it was cooked) Was I ever mistaken 鈥?when I got to the center of the steak鈥t was RED !! Not even 10 minutes went by  those abdominal pains came back again鈥︹€ack to the doctor I went鈥?she gave me more medication. I would not recommend this resort, the only things that represented 5 stars was the look of the resort, the beach, the pools  the cleanliness鈥?.other than that鈥?it should be a 2 or 3 star. I can鈥檛 believe people would say that the food was great here鈥T WAS HORRIBLE,  the selection was very minimal. We stayed at the Bahia in Mexico last year  it was great, that is why we went to this resort in Punta Cana鈥?.I guess you shouldn鈥檛 bank on them all being the same.AIR CONDITIONING PROBLEMS FOR 6 DAYS:Monday night, our room started getting really stuffy鈥?well; we find out that the Air Conditioning is not working throughout the resort. We received a letter on Wednesday, saying that they are working on fixing the A/C. The A/C did not work all week. The staff did not handle this situation very good, I would not go to this resort again because of this. They couldn鈥檛 even handle this situation鈥?could you image if you where there during a hurricane??? I would not trust them for that reason. We had to call the front desk for extra water, because it was so hot  sticky all week in our room. We didn鈥檛 sleep all week, because of it. They tried compensating me with a free 3 night stay鈥?which means I would have to pay for a flight back. After not being able to eat, drink alcohol, sleep  spending $300.00US on medical bills because of them鈥?that was not an acceptable offer! Then they tried offering me $200.00US鈥?.your telling me that $200.00US is a more valuable offer than a 3 night stay?? Then they tried to make me sign a letter for a refund on our safe  a 3 hour delay on our checkout as compensation鈥?.I DON鈥橳 THINK SO ! I told them they could keep my safe money  as far as the late check out goes鈥?too late we already checked out late. So, she wanted me to sign a Disclaimer for the late checkout, she was going to write it in Spanish  translate it to me鈥︹€AH RIGHT!!! I don鈥檛 think so. Upon checking out, they had promised us they were going to lock our luggage鈥檚  give us a courtesy room鈥︹€hat didn鈥檛 happen! So we went to the pool with our luggages because we still had to wait 3 hours for our bus to arrive. Oh I almost forgot the best part of this story鈥︹€he Saturday morning that we were leaving, we had a leak from our roof (where the A/C was)鈥?it got so bad that the ceiling looked like it was going to collapse, they kicked us out of our room for 3 hours. Well, when they told us we could go back in (which I think the manager rushed the technicians, because I told her that because of this we will not be able to checkout on time) My husband walked into the room first  they didn鈥檛 put the plastic/steel back up properly, it fell on his head as he walked in. I also found it very difficult to communicate with most of the staff there, they hardly speak any English. The maid was OK鈥?she was not replenishing our towels  minibar. So, I called the front desk  told them that if she wants a tip at the end of the week, she has got to work for it. Considering we had no A/C, they weren鈥檛 even giving us the same amount of drinks that where in there the first few days. You would think that they would put extra because of the A/C problems. The service in the buffets  restaurants were horrible, I would have to ask for a diet coke at least 4 times before I actually got it.I have travelled alot  have never had such a horrible experience like this ! I DO NOT recommend this place at all!!Iâ€™m going to start by saying that Iâ€™m not one of those people who is especially fussy about hotels, nor am I generally one to complain (you can see I've posted several other positive reviews about other hotels and resorts). They donâ€™t have to be modern or fancy, but they do have to be clean. We had a concern about the cleanliness of the beds in our rooms at this hotel and trying to resolve the issue after-the-fact was a very frustrating and extremely disappointing experience â€“ one of the worst customer service experiences Iâ€™ve ever had in my life! In April we travelled to the Caribbean for a week with friends and left their car at the Days Inn Toronto Airport before our trip, with the intent to stay overnight when we returned after a late flight. We chose the Days Inn because the price was reasonable and we werenâ€™t expecting a 5 star hotel. When we arrived we were very surprised that the lobby was recently renovated; everything was shiny and new and appeared very nice. We had pre-booked the airport shuttle and didnâ€™t have any issues getting to the airport. On our return, we landed at Pearson at 2:30am, it had been a long day of travelling, the weather was crummy and we were really looking forward to a few hours of sleep before driving home in the morning. We checked in sometime around 3:30am. When we entered our room we first noticed how everything (bathroom fixtures, carpet, furniture, etc.) looked brand new, but then we noticed the lights were already on, there was an open phone book on the coffee table and the bed had been turned down unevenly. It didnâ€™t look right, it seemed that someone else had been in this room already, so we didnâ€™t touch anything and called the front desk right away. The staff member at the desk agreed that the bed shouldnâ€™t be turned down already, apologized and brought us a key to another room within a few minutes. This was not a problem. However, once in the 2nd room, as we were getting ready for bed, our friends called from their room down the hall to say they had turned down their bed and found what appeared to be SCABS and BLOOD droplets on their sheets! They were really upset about this and said theyâ€™d prefer to just drive home, despite being exhausted. We then checked our bed and found 2 small spots, also looking like blood - near the pillow. My friend advised the front desk that he was willing to pay for the parking, after all, the car had been there for a week, but that we expected to be refunded for the rooms. Again, the man at the front desk apologized to us. He advised that he didnâ€™t have the authority to refund the rooms, but that he would let the manager know about it the next day. Once hearing that we werenâ€™t going to be refunded, we asked the front desk man to return to the rooms with us; we wanted him to see the condition of the beds and we wanted to take pictures. He did this and my friend took pictures. We left at 4am, only 30-40 minutes from when we had checked in. We stopped for coffee and drove 3 hours home. The next day, my friend and I each called the hotel and spoke with the manager, explaining our concerns. He did not even apologize for our experience. He said he was going to â€œinvestigateâ€� and he would call my friend back the next day. He did not call back the next day, not even after I called to follow up with him. In fact, it took a WEEK, after leaving several messages with other staff members and finally a phone call to register a complaint with a 1-800 customer service number, before we ever heard back from anyone at the hotel. At that time I was told it wasnâ€™t blood, but maybe ketchup or chili sauce on the sheets, which I donâ€™t believe. I was offered 50% off a future stay, which I thought was ridiculous â€“ blood or hot sauce aside, the way they had handled our concerns up until then was completely unacceptable and for that alone I would never return there - not even for a free stay. Besides that, even if it was ketchup on the sheets, it still means they werenâ€™t clean. I said that I didnâ€™t want 50% off a future stay, but I expected a refund. We didnâ€™t stay there because the beds werenâ€™t clean, not because we changed our minds or wanted to drive all night long. I was told that he had to consult the manager, but I would get a return call within 24 hours. Of course, no one from the hotel called me back, again. I had to call back several days later and after another very frustrating conversation, was finally told that they would refund us only for 1 room - not the room with the parking (which was my friendsâ€™ room, and actually the one that had the most stains on the bed and was the reason we left the hotel). Weâ€™ve moved on â€“ it was never about the money, but about the principle of it. Other than the man who was working the front desk that night, Iâ€™m extremely dissatisfied with how the other 3 managers/staff members I spoke with handled our concerns and I will continue to tell every person I know who is looking for an airport hotel to NEVER stay here. Even if the problem we had with the sheets was a 1-time thing, (maybe the housekeeper was having a horrible day?) I am confident that any guest who has any sort of issue/concern will experience a massive headache trying to resolve it with this management team!do not waste your money $$$ - stay at another vip hotel I read through many reviews on this site and found that this hotel seem to have the best and after friends and family said it would be nice for the location, I chose to stay. What a mistake! There are too many more hotels to choose from - don't make the same mistake I did.I did fill out the survey card left with my express check out. The next morning I received an email from the hotel, I assume it was a courtesy email that everyone gets after their stay.My response to their question: Please let us know how your stay wasDear, XXXI think it is important for you to know what you customers experience so that in the future other customers will not have to experience the same.I was very excited about staying at your hotel as friends and co-workers told me that it was a great location and one of the nicest that they had heard of, and some even had family and friends stay there when they visited.My son came to visit me for the weekend and most all the hotels were booked in the area. I usually stay at the Hyatt Regency on Embarcadero however; they were booked for the nights we wanted to stay in the city. I have four adult children, two grandchildren, and many friends that visit from Texas, Montana, and Florida often and enjoy staying in the city a couple of nights when they visit. For some they love the Union Square area for shopping and others love the Wharf.Our stay did not get off on the right foot to begin with, we arrived in the city about 1:45PM and I called ahead to see if I could valet my car and see when the earliest we could check in, I hoped for 2:00 or 2:30PM since my reservation said 3PM check in. The person at the front desk told me that my room would not be ready until 4 or 5pm because the guests in that room had a late check out. When I said is that the only room you have, they said yes with the view you want and the high floor. They told me that housekeeping would not be able to finish those high floors before 4 or 5pm and that I could have a lower floor without a view of the city.I wasn鈥檛 to happy about that since we had arrived expecting to check in at least by 3pm, get dressed for our adventure on the night Alcatraz tour at 5:15pm. We were very disappointed that we had to wait around in the rain and not be able to change for the 5:15PM tour as we had planned. It was not a good situation. However, we made the best of it and after the tour on the Island; we arrive late at the hotel and checked in.I would have thought that if a guest were paying over $600.00 dollars a night for a room the quality of service would have been a lot better. I could have stayed at a motel 6 and got the same customer service. Your staff did not seem to care weather we got our room or not, there was a too bad attitude and I did not care much for that.In the morning we went out the front door about 10:50AM and ask the door man standing on the curb where the best place to have breakfast was, he laughed at me and said, 鈥淟ady breakfast is over by 11AM everywhere and your not going to find it anywhere鈥? You might tell your doorman that just a few doors down on the same block they have breakfast and 2-blocks up there is a great little dinner that offer鈥檚 it 24/7.Our experience was less than wonderful, and your staff was rude for the exception of the bellhop that helped us out the next morning and valet. I was not impressed with the bellhop that delivered our bags to our room since he was at the elevator before us and as I rounded the corner by the Concierge Desk, I noticed a black leather jacket lying on the floor. As I passed by it, I thought wow that looks like mine and when I turned the corner where the elevators where there was our cart and the bellhop was being told he dropped something and he went back to pickup my jacket off of the floor. I room was nice however I was surprise with the quality of the TV, not what I expected for such an elaborately decorated Hotel. Furniture was different colors of wood, looked bad like they just through whatever they had in there.Overall, I think it could have been a great stay and I am sure not all of your guests experience the same as we did; however, the cost in no way equaled our experience. That night I would have preferred to drive 35 minutes back to Sam Ramon and stay at my own house.I would not plan to stay at this hotel again and I would most likely not recommend it as I do not feel the quality of customer service is there since there were more than two individuals employed there that were not customer friendly.On a lighter note, I do want you to know that I am more often motivated to right a job well done letter to companies, rather than a disappointed letter, as I believe everyone has a bad day. I made this an exception because it just seemed so not right for the value. I am all about customer service, you can have the greatest product to offer, however if it is not presented well, it has no value to me. I hope you will investigate and make improvements for your future guests as I think your hotel is beautiful on the surface.Respectfully,Guest in room 3084The response I got was from another department head asking me to name names, like I ran around the whole time, taking names and wasting my time on their problems. I gave enough information to them that they could have verified that I did check in late and I valeted around 2PM that day, why would I have hung out in the rain, if anyone remembers it rained hard on Oct 12th. I have to give them credit for offerring to upgrade my next stay, like I would through away any more money on that to see if I could be any more miserable. NOT, I declined the anytime upgrade and you know why, I think someone should have called me in person, but they didn't they chose to email me back an forth, wasting more of my time for nothing. If they really did have the attitude that they strive for the best, they would have offered me a free night, even if it was an off-night to show me the service could be better. I didn't want anything free however the thought would have made the differenc for me. The rooms are NOT worth the money my total was $618 for one night, imagine I knew that before I booked it, that is why I booked a nice hotel. Oh! well we live and we learn, I have stayed at better and look forward to better nights in SFO when my family and friends visit. If you chose to stay here, I hope you get better treatment than I do. And FYI - there are a lot of places that serve breakfast after 11AM.Have a great day,Unhappy guest that stayed at this hotel.Firstly, it is worth pointing out that I have this year alone stayed in five star hotels in Hawaii, San Francisco, Las Vegas and London and although with varying degrees of pleasure have never felt compelled to write anything good or bad on this type of site - but wanted to warn people about the hotel...! Shocking experience! Imagine my excitement when my girlfriend surpised me on boxing day and said that she had booked a 5 star hotel for a nice relaxing stress free break between 27th December until 1st January..... Well let me tell you exactly how that excitement vanished almost immediately.... We only live in Sutton in Surrey so to get the train to the hotel would have only taken 40 minutes but due to the fact that we had luggage I suggested I call and ask if they had a car park for guests staying at the hotel. After having to explain my simple question in several different ways , I was put on hold and another person answered - I had to once again explain my question but the other person (on reception) wouldnt tell me the anwer until I had given all our booking details and references etc, aarrrgggg! ...before declaring that YES the hotel had parking available to guests and YES we were entitled to one....Great! I thought , even if that took ten minutes to find the answer... So we set off and and an hour and a half later we arrived at the hotel. Great looking hotel from the outside so we were delighted. We joined the back of queuing cars, appearing to be going down to the car park (under the hotel) and after 10 minutes of going nowwhere my girlfriend went in to reception to find out where to park exactly and what the hold up was. We were told the parking was 5 minutes away and would cost Â£2.50 a day - ok, so not exactly what we were expecting but ok we could deal with that...We then asked for directions, which for some reason didnt seem readily available and were then handed some after another 5 minutes of waiting and to our dis-belief on the directions was the cost of the car park - Â£2.50 PER HOUR!!! so our stay was going to cost us an extra Â£150 odd quid , even though someone from the hotel had confirmed that parking was included.... We asked to see the manager to discuss this and the situation only got worse......We waited another 5 minutes for him to come down to reception only to be told that he didnt believe one of his staff would have said parking was included and that unless I could provide him with a name there wasnt anything he could do?!! I couldnt believe this....I was beign accused of lying and besides the staff never introduce who they are when answering the phones so this was impossible.... We asked him to be a little flexible as there was eveidentally plenty of parking underneath the hotel, which has a large conferencing facility....but he once again repeated that there wasnt anything he could do. I explained that we would not have driven had it not been for this mis-information we were given and that I wanted to know about a refund (I only got to this point because he appeared to really not care) as we were not happy and would stay at another hotel...He then walked off and came back 10 minutes later with a solution we thought - NO! he merely pointed out that we would still have to pay the bill in full as we hadnt cancelled 24 hours prior .... This was aready a nightmare and reduced my girlfriend to tears right there in reception and wasnt exactly the first impressions written about in the brochure!....By this point we had been at the hotel for half an hour , our car was in a non-moving queue outside , we wasnt checked in and the hotel management were basically saying we were liars!! Great Start...!! To be fair to them , as it was a bank holiday the hotel manager suggested we park our car oustide the hotel on a yellow until just before 6am and then move it to the paying car park so save on a days rate...Due to the fact this was supposed to be a relaxing holiday we didnt take him up on that offer. Having been told we would lose over Â£500 by cancelling we reluctantly parked the car at the pay car park and trudged the 10-15 minute walk back with our bags but it didnt end there! The room we were allocated was actually on the same level as the train station platform , so people who were bored could look straight in to our room which was not very private at al and felt very unsecurel....We swiftly returned to reception to ask to be moved and were (to their credit) given a room on the 8th floor which was clean and a standard double, which was to be our home for 5 days.... I will simply sum up our remaining experience : 1) We reported to reception that we had a message appear on our phone but couldnt acccess it as when you followed the instructions it died - the girl didnt know the answer but would call back - no call back 2) Even with the heating on the rooms were very cold and we had to request an extra duvet. 3) After a couple of days we thought to ask consierge if they could find out if there was any other (cheaper) car parks in the area - they said they would phone back - yep, you guessed it....! no call back. 4) There was never a welcome or goodbye by any of the staff throughout our stay and was a very odd and unfriendly atmosphere. 5) The walls are too thin and you can hear conversations people are having either side of your room at night. 6) Some rooms have blaconys and we were unlucky enough to be above one that had - The noise from these balconies from people partying or smoking has already been mentioned in a review so I wont go into it - just that it is loud! On the plus side, I have to say the gym and spa was a delight and we enjoyed this very much and the location is perfect. Having stayed at the Grange in St Pauls in October I know that the issues are not with the chain but with this particular hotel....But unfortunately and as with most people who experience bad customer services, we are put off the chain altogether. We are happy to be home!Visited Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights during early January. After landing at Singaore Changi Airport, we decided to take a cab to facilitate our trip to the hotel. We're a family of 4, and I was travelling with my parents and older brother. We booked 2 rooms, one king size bedroom and a two double bed bedroom. There were a lot of check in counters, everyone seemed well groomed and friendly. After a short line up we gave our hotel reservation reference and online receipts which clearly states what we have booked: 2 rooms. One with a single king size bed, and the other with two beds. For some odd reason, they couldn't find one of our rooms. It took them a good 30 minutes of 'checking the system' to finally 'find' our missing room. The first room (king size bed) was located in Tower 1, 40th floor while the second room (2 beds) was in Tower 1, 30th floor. We decided to go the the 40th floor together first to check out the magnificent view. Unfortunately, the magnetic key cards were not working. We tried both key cards, and the little light on the doorknob will just flash yellow and remain locked. We decided to use the service phone by the elevator and explain our situation. After 10 minutes, a hotel staff (hotel porter I assume) comes out of the elevator and walks us to our room. He tries our keys (and of course they weren't working), he inserts the new key and opens the door. However, he walked in with us and just stood there. I might have been extra sensitive, but the 4 of us (entire family) felt quite uncomfortable and it definitely felt like he was expecting a tip from us. There was NO WAY I was tipping for a service that was originally the hotel's fault for giving us faulty keys! If anything, I would have expected the hotel staff to apologize on behalf of the hotel for causing us this trouble and wait time! The room itself was nice, surrounded by brown and beige tones. All amenities were fully equipped (a digital locker, complimentary coffee and tea, bathrobes, plenty of towels, all bathrooms amenities full. etc). The bed was cleaned and even though the carpet (being light brown) looked a little dirty, complimentary sandals were provided. We then head down to the 30th floor to check our second room. This time the magnetic keys worked, BUT it was somehow locked from the inside!!! What could this mean??? The only explanation we had was that there was already somebody in our room!!! Confused and upset, we walked over to the service phone by the elevator and explained our situation. The person on the phone asked if he could send someone upstairs to do an ID check. I was baffled by this, since this will not solve anything! She checked the room reservation and of course the names didn't match, meaning that there was probably a mistake by the check in staff where they gave us an already occupied room! I was getting quite frustrated by now and extremely tired since I traveled over 10 hours prior to landing at Singapore. The phone staff tells us to go down to the check in counter again. I was perplexed as to the level of inefficiency this Hotel has. I asked if there was somebody in specific we should talk to, but was told to explain the WHOLE story again to the check in staff. Seriously?!?! Fine. We go down again, and of course the lady who checked us in was off duty. We explained our situation to a new lady and after 10 minutes of 'checking the system', she could not give us any explanation of what exactly happened! Not even a 'sorry'!!! She then tells us that there are no more rooms in tower 1 and she could check us in at Tower 2. We explained how this will cause an incontinent, since we wanted to travel together as a family and our parents room are in Tower 1. She couldn't help us with that and just waited for us to agree to take a Tower 2 room. Fine, reluctantly we accepted since I was mad furious and deadly tired. All I wanted to do was to lie down. We receive the key and guess what? Our room is now on the 13th floor! From 30th to 13th! We walked in and realized that the room size is the same as my parents' 40th floor, but when we opened the window, all we could see was the mall's rooftop from across the street. Horrible view. While I was about to drink some water (they had 2 complimentary bottles), I realized that there was a half empty bottle of water on the desk with a different brand. I asked my brother if it was his, and he said no. This could only mean that the housekeeping staff 'forgot' to take away an open bottled of water and left it right in the middle of the desk! Upon further inspection, the cabinet sliding door where the digital locker was located was damaged and it would not open and close properly. I called the hotel again and asked them 'why is there a open bottle of water left by the previous occupants in our room?' I also made sure that they knew the sliding door was broken, so they wouldn't charge it on us as damaged room fee. How could a hotel of this caliber miss on so many level??? check in staff was unfriendly and unapologetic. They were extremely inefficient and could not accommodate us in the simplest terms. Housekeeping staff leaving used bottle of waters behind. Phone operator also extremely inefficient. Hotel service staff showing attitude for a service that should be tipped free and apologetic towards. The hotel itself looked marvelous. The hotel amenities were superb (swimming pools, viewing deck, restaurants, food courts, shopping, casino). But PERSONALLY when I pay this amount of money for a room in a hotel, the most important factor is the room and where we will sleep. The rest (swimming pools, viewing deck, restaurants, shopping) are extras that makes the hotel even better, they are secondary issues to reinforce what a comfortable environment they have to provide us with a care free, comfortable night rest. This point was entirely missed by the hotel so no matter how great their secondary and supportive activities and amenities were, the entire feeling of Marina Sands Bay Singapore was simply terrible. Just terrible. And yes, this might sound cliche, but first impressions are THAT important.Is the name "Paradisus" an inference to "paradise?" NOT HERE! I've used this website as a reference many times before travelling, and I never felt compelled to write a review until now. Consider this review a warning to anyone pondering a vacation at this destination. Our family of 4 vacations every year. What we seek are nice accomodations, beautiful beach, good food, and no hassles. We are not snobs and would have no problem staying at a Marriott on the beach as long as it was quiet, comfortable, and clean. When we book at what is deemed a 4-star hotel we come with high expectations. This was our first mistake. Here is my laundry list:1) The Royal Service is a waste of money. My husband and I paid for a RS room which was identical to our children's regular room with the exception of the ocean view. Actually, our kids' room was nicer. Our room did not even have a door to the bathroom. it was a 'corral' style swing door affording no privacy whatsoever. They claim to reserve a part of the beach and pool for RS, but they never checked. Anyone could use their beach and pool. We downgraded to a regular room after seeing this, which was half the price.2) We moved rooms 3 times. And not one of the rooms had a bed that was remotely comfortable. The first room would not cool down sufficiently. The next room had 2 double beds, which were so rickety that whenever my husband rolled over in bed it creaked so loudly that it woke me up. The next room they gave us had such a musty smell and so many flies in the room. We finally settled on a room in a building that bordered an adjacent property that must have had a working farm, and every morning at 5:45 we were woken up by roosters. The water pressure in the shower was almost non-existent. And bring your own conditioner, they only have shampoo. And bring bug spray with DEET. You'll need it every night.3) The food. And i use that term loosely. Firstly, eat a huge breakfast. This is the only passable meal of the day. if you want a decent dinner, you need to make reservations which you cannot do until you actually arrive at the resort, at which time they have nothing available. you cannot do it by phone, you have to walk down to the clubhouse at the beach and wait in line with everyone else for 1 employee at a computer to search every restaurant for every day you are there. only to tell you you can eat at 9:30. When we finally did get a rservation (and it was only because someone was nice enough to give us theirs that they were not using) it was at the french restaurant that was awful. The steak restaurant too was bad, Chinese was worse, and the italian was basically stouffers entrees with elio's pizza. The only good restaurant we ate at was the Japanese one. My husband walked in there on our last night and tipped the hostess to let us eat at 6:45 without a reservation. The best move we made was the night we got in a cab and went to the Hard Rock Cafe and Tony Roma's 15 minutes away from the resort.4) The beach. If you are used to Caribbean beaches where the water is turquoise glass, and you can walk in and see your feet, this is not the beach for you. The surf had crashing waves and an undertow. We went snorkling one day and couldn't imagine that a 15 minute boat ride would take us to a reef that had calm waters. Of course, it did not. And the snorkling trip they provide is mediocre, at best. The equipment is passed on from one group to another without even cleaning the snorkles! Gross. My husband is an early riser, but even he wasn't early enough because by 7:30 am all the shaded bali beds were taken. We realized that people were putting towels on chairs the night before, and thus we had to do the same in order to have chairs on the beach. This is way too much of a hassle when you're on vacation. There is no one serving drinks on the beach. Every time you want a drink (and at an all inclusive, there are plenty of drinks being served) you have to get up and go to a bar and get it yourself. The help is kind and friendly but speak very little English. Some of the most basic requests were not understood. (i.e.'where is the bathroom?')5) The Casino is tiny. Don't come for the nightlife. If you must come here, there is only one place on the property I would stay. The RESERVE. It is a beautiful brand new complex with decent restaurants and a beautiful pool The rooms are brand new and very chic. However, if you are beach people and want to go back to your room during the day, it's a hike. They provide jitneys that take you back and forth. There was one thing that lingered with us. As we unzipped our bags back at home, the musty smell from our room was right back with us. Every article of clothing needed to be washed and fumigated. The memento of one HUGE disappointment in Punta Cana.This hotel was a HUGE disappointment. I booked the hotel about two months in advance for three nights, the first of which was a Universal Studios package (breakfast, Uni Studios tickets and valet parking), the other two the weekend package which included the valet parking. The rates were very admittedly good and unlike one of the reviews I read, the hotel was actually extremely easy to find using google map directions to aide me however upon arriving at the hotel we had to wait for 20 minutes to get into the valet parking area (granted they were having a prom that night). Once we got into the reception area (beautiful but quite empty looking - could use a decorator) we were greeted (and I use that word with a grain of salt) at the check-in counter by a very rude young man who made me feel quite uncomfortable. We got up to our room which was very pretty indeed - until I went into the bathroom where there was a reddish sort of stain on the bathtub and the fixtures were so dirty they looked as though they'd never been cleaned and until I saw the view - we were also on a 'club floor' but with a distressing view of the back of the other building. We waited for our luggage to arrive as we were wanting to go out that evening and needed to change but the time ticked on and on and still no luggage. I also realized that we weren't given our Universal Studios tickets when we checked in nor was there a hotel directory (with room service menu etc) in the room so I called the bellhop to find out where our luggage might be. I was asked by the lady if we had asked for our luggage to be brought up (umm-yup?) to which I of course replied yes, we asked the valet to send it up and even told him exactly which bags were needed. After putting me on hold for an interminable length of time she came back on the phone to say we didn't know you wanted it brought in (umm that's interesting since we were on record with reservations for three days so not really sure what we would do without our luggage which was in plain view in the car!!) and would I like directions to my car so I could go and get it? No exaggeration. Well, I've never been asked this before and was more than a little dumbfounded but after gathering my wits I nicely said no I was under the impression the bellhop would be bringing it up. She then transferred me to the bellhop who shockingly also asked if I would like to come down and get it!! To put this into perspective, my 11 yr old daughter and I were on a three week roadtrip, we had two large suitcases, one smaller suitcase, one laptop, one large toiletries bag and other sundry bags which we carried in ourselves so this was not a manageable amount of luggage for me to go and "pick up" from the lobby. Anyway, they eventually brought it up but let me tell you it was hard to give the guy a tip (even though of course none of it was his fault). I then phoned the front desk to ask about the Uni Studios tickets which they questioned me on saying they had been given to me at check-in which I was again surprised to hear (I guess they didn't believe me?) I told her they had not been given to me which I should think would easily enough be checked. I was again put on hold for ages and when she finally came back she tersely said she'd send them up. I then had to ask her about the hotel directory which she said was a housekeeping issue and that I'd have to speak with them about it at which point she then transferred me although I half expected her to hang up so I'd have to phone them myself. I spoke to housekeeping who were very nice. Our luggage still had not arrived, in fact when it eventually DID arrive it had taken an hour and fifteen minutes. By this time it was too late for us to make our dinner reservations in West Hollywood that I'd had for a month so we had little choice but to order from the room service menu and unlike the person from Nebraska who commented that the prices were reasonable (omg - $16 for a hamburger is not what I call reasonable) I must heartily disagree with them and believe me, I'm not the most budget-minded person by any stretch of the imagination. The bill came...$36 for 1 hamburger, 1 tiny half bottle of 7-Up and 1 piece of apple pie with ice cream which included (although I was not informed about this) the gratuity (I added tip to make the total $40) and taxes. When I phoned a day later to ask why the bill was so high they then told me the gratuity was already added and said they'd refund my $4 tip! - this was not in fact done not that it would have made a difference anyway) Quite unbelievable. I very badly wanted to complain about the whole experience but thought I'd wait another night and see how things went. I didn't end up complaining though I truly wish I had done but only because the person who checked us out was so rude and made me feel so uncomfortable that I felt terribly intimidated - he didn't even ask how our stay was (that would have been the point where I would have said something) or whether everything was to our liking - questions which I have come to expect from the calibre of the hotels I stay in. This all says nothing about the surrounding area which is INDEED slummy looking. The area coming from the north from the highway to the hotel is fine (Mus of Metropolitan Art, etc) but the area an immediate block south and all around from there becomes highly unsafe looking and feeling. I had to advise my daughter not to look at anyone as we were driving by, the area IS ugly and scary looking. Your member from Canoga Park who said the area is NOT unsafe is kidding themselves, when he says "further east of the hotel" he must mean by further, a block, east, west and south as well and I would under no circumstances walk around with my daughter in the area surrounding the hotel, in fact I wouldn't chance it with a male adult either. I will never stay in this hotel again unless they were to take some serious instruction in customer service and the art of dealing with people effectively. Do these people care at all about how they represent the hotel and the impression they leave people? Apparently not but the hotel management should be advised that this is the downfall of the hotel and a probable reason why they get little repeat business. The hotel's architecture is so very, very beautiful and it's history so steeped in tradition that it's a very big shame it should be ruined by the lacking service of many of it's front-line staff. Shame on this hotel and shame on many of it's employees - a HUGE disappointment.Without a doubt, the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, outside of India. This hotel was not our first choice to stay during our recent pre-Christmas trip to New York - it wasn't even our tenth choice, due to the poor Tripadvisor ranking this place has received. I'd spent a long time trawling the net for a reasonably priced place to stay in a central location, but every hotel I was interested in was either fully booked, or extortionately priced. So, in the end, with misgivings, I booked the Edison, which still had vacancies in spite of its indisputably brilliant location. We had also noticed that every bad Tripadvisor review was followed by a flurry of excellent ones, posted by "new reviewers", who hadn't posted before, or since. If nothing else, the Edison has a well-developed "damage limitation department". I wish they devoted their energy to improving the hotel instead. Now, before you think I'm being a drama queen, please take a look at the pictures I took in the bathroom of room 1645. Eeeeeuwwww! If you like your reviews short, stop reading now, and just DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF! If you like your reviews detailed, here goes: We booked a double room for three nights, at a cost of $1,085.71 incl. of taxes. We flew in from Munich on a flight that took longer than usual, due to high winds over the Atlantic, and were pretty tired. It took over an hour to get through immigration. We took a cab from JFK to the Edison, where a fed up looking doorman dumped our cases on the busy pavement, and told us to wait. We decided to wheel our own instead, and made our way to reception. The first impression that greeted us was a strong smell of rancid frying fat. We identified the likely source of the reek as the Cafe Edison, which has an entrance just off the lobby as you walk in the door. We made our way to the reception desk, where two receptionists were busy in a private conversation, and ignored us completely for what seemed an age. Finally, in possession of our key cards, we headed for the lift. The public areas were festive and pleasant enough, if somewhat tired, with scuffed furnishings, and large rolls of new carpet being stored on the way to the entrance of the Italian Restaurant towards the back of the building. This was Friday - when we left on Monday the rolls of carpet were still there. Is there really no storage at all away from public view? It's not just about esthetics - why narrow the way to the back door, a potential escape in case of fire? Once we stepped out of the lift on our floor, our hearts sank. Scruffy corridor, patched up paint work, battered radiator covers, hideous institutional pinky-beige paint work, bad lighting, and the room was so vile we headed straight back down to reception. A young woman issued us with a new room key, and even managed to crack a smile when tipped. The second room was the same size and location, but on a higher floor, and the carpet was marginally less revolting. Had we been less exhausted, we'd have gone back down, hopefully "third time lucky", but frankly, we just wanted to get some sleep. Thus committed, we felt a bit, well, screwed, for the rest of our stay. We should have looked for somewhere else, but that's not how you want to spend precious holiday time, and we already knew the town was pretty booked. The room contained a standard double bed, with polyester sheets, lumpy foam pillows, and a very pronounced dip in the center of the mattress, that suggested a) this is usually allocated as a single room, b) the mattress is cheap and old. Gross! How many generations of tourists have sweated into this thing? Space was so limited that only one side of the bed had a bedside table. The rest of the furniture was old and scuffed - the sort of stuff that people abandon on the pavement when they move house. On the plus side, it was a dual aspect room with a window on each side, one overlooking the distant Hudson, which was nice. Also, the heater was powerful, and we were toasty in spite of the seasonal drop in temperature. The bathroom doesn't have a proper extractor, but a sort of "ventilation hole" with an ill-fitting grille. There was a shower curtain instead of a screen, which must lead to endless flooding and water penetration problems. I have documented the mould and mildew problem in the attached photographs. We had one breakfast in the Cafe Edison, pancakes and bacon, and French toast with bacon. The bacon was pre-cooked, cold and hard, the OJ cheap and synthetic tasting. Cheap white bread, one tiny plastic portion of milk per coffee - thankfully there's a Starbucks down on the next corner. We had one dinner in the Italian Restaurant downstairs. Split-level layout - we were seated at a tiny downstairs table by a totally fed-up greeter, in spite of the place being almost empty. This left us nose-level with the stinky carpet of the upper level. Two waiters kept whining within earshot about the shortcomings of the guy who brings the bread and water. The coat check lady was charming and smiley, other than that our impression was of serious staff dissatisfaction throughout the hotel. If the guest rooms are that depressing, what must the areas be like that are out of public view? I'd hate to work there, seriously. Apart from the hotel, we had a really super time in this gorgeous, exciting city, and enjoyed the sightseeing, wonderful helicopter flight with liberty helicopters, a fun Southern soul food dinner with yummy draught beer at "Delta", with super friendly staff and good music, which is in walking distance on 9th, good steak and wine at Capital Grille (also easily walkable), fantastic Christmas decorations everywhere, super views from the Rockefeller Center, amazing architecture, and the not-to-be-missed Grand Central Station. The Woolworth Building, omg, so stunning! The only other disappointment was the tatty sprawl that is Macy's. Please don't stay here, and ignore the "1 review" brigade that posts rave reviews. The only plus in this place is the location, if you need to be close to Times Square.My partner booked this hotel aftering seeing it online, and calling up the owner. It was my birthday so we wanted a nice weekend away in London, something basic, not too far away from the main attractions and not too expensive. The hotel we booked was called the Admiral Hotel. It says on the website that you have to check in at the Kingsway Park hotel, which was situted a few steps away. This was fine. The Admiral looked nice on the website pictures, showing a nice modern bar, and clean rooms. It was this hotel we had booked! Once into the Kingsway Park hotel, we where then told thats where we would be staying. It seems that's where everyone stays! It appeared the nice clean Admiral Hotel was not having guests! This was indeed empty! We checked in early, and where told where our rooms where. As other reviews say, the stairs where very steep and there was no lift or warning which didnt help someone in my party that had a knee complaint, but i havent let that interfere with the review, as i could of enquired upon booking. My room had a terrible smell as soon as i walked in. I wasnt expecting anything less though, as the hotel upon entry was tired, shabby, had a smell to it, and had dirty woodwork and walls, and frayed carpets. The divan bed was 2 singles together, with a badly stained base. The lamps had stained and burnt lampshades. The furniture was dated and didnt fit in the room. There was no fancy chairs and furniture like the i've just seen on the Kingsway Park Hotel website! We kepting hurting ourselves when walking around the crammed room on the furniture. The portable tv did work, but the picture wasnt quite viewable, i felt like i had double vision after looking at it. The main critisim is aimed at the toilet which was a portocabin shower and loo in one type of thing, which was placed in the room, but then was incorporated into the paintwork. It smelt, had mould on the shower, and when sitting on the loo, your foot was in the shower area, which was very small. The bottom of the door was also covered in rust. I did not use the shower at all, as it was very off putting. My partner did, and he was fine with it. The other room we booked, for other parties, was very similar but they had a bath, and a more normal bathroom, which had a terrible smell of damp in it. I didnt sleep well during my two night stay. The bedding was a sheet, and then an extremely 'itchy' blanket, with a floral throw over the top. This was covered in stains. Me and my partner had one small pillow each, there was no other bedding to use. Breakfast was included in the price described as a 'full english' we went down for breakfast which was served in small room crammed with tables in the basement. Two ladies, whom we saw cleaning rooms served breakfast. The option was cereal, toast and the cooked breakfast was a boiled slice of bacon, egg (scrambled,fried or boiled) plum tomato and a sausage. I did not recieve what i ordered for breakfast on both mornings, and didnt rectify it as the person serving breakfast could not fully understand my english. Our bed was made while we where out, and there where towels left in the room. The manager/owner was around for most of the time, and there seemed to be approx 6-7 other guest there, excluding my party. There was no problem returning. The front door was unlocked and there was a gentleman on the desk. The latest we returned was around 11pm. The area of this hotel sussex gardens, has a whole host of hotels similar to this one. They all had vacancies in there window, but did look a lot cleaner and friendlier. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. It did us for the weekend, because we had no choice once we got there. Location was great for us, lots of restuarants, and paddington station near by, but for the price, which can seem cheap, im sure there are others for the same price in better condition. In my opinion, it wasnt clean, wasnt comfortable, the food wasnt good, so it was a huge let down for me. Luckily the great company i had, and London being so fantastic didnt make my weekend a complete let down. I have written this review within 7 hours of returning as i would hate anyone to have a weekend ruined, and this hotel would do that! Don't be fooled thinking they put you up in the Admiral hotel, when infact your staying at the Kingsway Park. The website for the Kingsway Park Hotel says it has recently been refurbished! Id of hated to of seen what it was like before! Both the Kingsway Park and The Admiral Hotel have individual websites, the pictures on both are extremely different to what you get, so there not worth looking at! Please look at reviews for the Kingsway Park when booking the Admiral as thats where you will probably stay!the restaurant was completely empty, but she gave me a dirty look and asked, no reservations?Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.I submitted this following complaint to the Better Business Bureau of New Orleans: I stayed at the Andrew Jackson Hotel at 919 Royal Street for 3 nights, checking in on July 21, 2005, and out on July 24, 2005. I was told I would receive an email confirmation of my reservations, but I never received any email from the hotel. Upon checking in, I had to present my credit card. I used my BankOne debit card which also serves as a Visa credit card. I was charged for the full room price plus $30 for using a debit card. I was unaware of this $30 charge, because it was not explained or even mentioned to me. I signed the paper agreeing to pay the full amount. When I checked my bank balance the next day, this amount had been taken out. I then realized I was not given a receipt for signing, only my two room keys. Upon attempting to check out, the woman ran my debit card again without asking me for my card, because she already had the card numbers in her system. I was this time charged for the full room price, minus the $30 debit card fee. At no point during check in or check out or my visit was I informed they would run my card twice for whatever reason. When she presented me with the card receipt to sign, I asked her if I hadn't already signed one when I checked in. She said yes but this was the real charge. She then informed me the first money debited from my account was being "held" or "frozen" then told me I could call my bank with my receipt information to have them release the first charge from the hotel so I could have the money back in my account. I asked her to clarify why they were double charging me, and she said they were not. However, I had already signed two debit card receipts at this point and had her tell me I would have to call my bank. I didn't understand how this could not be double charging, so I asked for her to explain again. She attempted twice, and the first explanation sounded as if the money from my account was just being held and when this authorization went through, it would be released to them. Upon further questioning, the woman said it was being held by the bank but this charge would be taken also and I would have to still get my first amount of money back somehow. It was during this I was told that I had incurred a $30 charge for using a debit card the first time. The second receipt did not include this charge, and I was not told if it was still going to be taken from the account or anything. I finally just took my receipt and left in utter confusion. I still do not understand any of their logic as it seems to change every moment. The room was expensive enough with all of its problems then to have to deal with this issue was ridiculous. Please see below for a list of room problems. I was also charged $1.50 for long distance telephone charges when checking out. The phone number was a toll free 800 number. The hotel also employs false advertising. On their website, the hotel is shown in the pictures as white. The hotel is actually yellow. There were no hair dryers in the room, I do not know if you had to ask for one or not. There is also a promise of "Lush and Beautiful Gas-Lit French Quarter Courtyard with Exquisite Fountains." There was one fountain, and no evidence of gas lights anywhere. Parking was also an issue. I was told there was limited self parking at their sister hotel, the St. Pierre at 911 Burgundy Street. When I asked where to park, I was told that the St. Pierre's lot was full and I would have to go elsewhere. Room Problems: Fire sprinkler on western wall was painted over. Electrical outlet on western wall do not work. Mirror on northern wall was not firmly attached to wall and wobbled at slightest disturbance. The top socket in the electrical outlet could not keep anything plugged in due to its looseness. One of the beds' sheets had unidentifiable dark spots. One bed was missing a middle knob. Desk was missing knobs. Old nails were left sticking out of the walls and just painted over. The neck and switch for the lamp on the nightstand were not in tightly and turned when you tried to switch the lamp on. The closet door stuck when trying to open or close it. The closet had an odd odor. The bathroom door stuck when trying to open or close it, and it could not be opened all of the way due to the bed placement. Cabinets under the sink in the bathroom had warped doors that did not meet all the way down the middle. No thermostat in room, but the thermostat in 107 seemed to control the temperature for both rooms. The ceiling fan shook as it ran. When pulling the cords for the lights and the fan, it tilted from side to side and shook. Middle light in ceiling fan light fixture was burned out. There were various cosmetic problems with the paint - peeling, discoloration, and water damage.Another friend had to ask 3 times for parmesan cheese.Perhaps my expectations of a Hyatt were too high, but I didn't anticipate the quality of stay and calibre of service I received. I don't know enough about the Hyatt chain to appreciate whether the "Regency" line of hotels are there more budget... but regardless the summary of my experiences below do not reflect well on Hyatt or any 3 star + hotel. 1. Upon arrival I parked my vehicle on P2 and proceeded to walk toward the elevator. Someone who looked to be wearing an Engineering uniform exited from a non-labeled door and exited the area where one waits for the elevator. This staff person did not smile, did not hold the door for me or engage with me in any way. As a result, my suitcase became stuck as the door shut making a very awkward first impression. 2. The Front Desk seemed generally understaffed. I called to register my vehicle after using the kiosk check-in and was transferred by the operator to the F/D only to be put on hold for quite some time. I called back, explained to the Operator I had been placed on hold for several minutes. While he did take my plate and said he would register it, there was no apology or sense of urgency from the gentleman for me having been put on hold for some time. 3. I was initially checked into 1536. Decently sized room, modern in decor (identical to other photos posted here). Much to my surprise, I came across spots of urine on the toilet seat. When I called down, Sheena at the desk was quite polite and offered another room, but informed me that the Concierge was going to busy with another guest, so they wouldn't be able to come up and help me for 5 minutes or so, and suggested that I could either wait, or come down myself. Not really wanting to wait around in a dirty room, and since I had stuff I wanted to get to, I opted to go down myself. When I got down, I spoke with a Jose who appeared to be a manager (this was after a wait at the Desk of 2 or 3 mins. as all agents were busy - speaking to point #2). A bellman did approach me while waiting to make small talk which was a nice touch. Once speaking with Jose, he apologized and offered to upgrade me for the inconvenience to one of their "view rooms" overlooking the CN Tower and I was given 1912. I am not sure if Jose just didn't pick his words carefully or is newer and doesn't know his product well, both my original room 1536 and new room 1912 have views of the CN Tower, and while 1912 is a better view of the two, I wouldn't necessarily sell somoene of the CN Tower view when moving them from somewhere else that has a similar feature... especially as a means of compensation for a negative experience. 4. I called for Turndown Service when I went to the gym. I returned to the room to find the bed turned down nicely and the radio on, drapes drawn. But I had taken a shower on arrival and was surprised to see that the washroom had not been touched. The wet towels were still in the tub and no new towels had been given. Turndown service is normally considered a second, light, evening service... and while I wouldn't expect a full re-cleaning, I was surprised that the attendant didn't at least remove the old towels and provide a set of new ones. 5. The toilet doesn't flush properly. You need to hold down the flusher/handle until the bowl fills with water sufficiently for it to flush, you can't just push the handle and walk away. This is a very easy fix by a Maintenance person if reported (I will be mentioning it at check-out for the sake of the next guest). 6. Called for Room Service in the morning and ordered the Eggs Benedict and an Apple/Soy Shake. Food was good, but the shake is advertised with a Biscotti which never arrived... not a big issue, but worth mentioning in light of everything else. All in all my stay has been disappointing. Granted I got in on a very good rate, it doesn't leave me with a positive impression of Hyatt, which I had always regarded as being a very well run, service oriented organization. The only time during my stay and my MANY encounters with staff either at the desk, in the bar or over the telephone where my name was used was with the Room Service person, otherwise zero name recognition. Luckily I am a heavy sleeper, but as I sit at the desk in the room and write this review, I can clearly hear every word of the conversation of the gentleman next door. Perhaps its because I am sitting near the window where soundproofing is probably more challenging, but this might be a potential issue for any light sleepers. Truthfully I didn't notice this during the course of the night. I went down to the bar for a beer and to watch the hockey game. The hotel's proximity to the Entertainment District and probably many clubs meant there were young men and women coming in and out the entire evening (around 10-11pm) and were highly intoxicated. Not that this is the hotel's fault, and I understand they can't control the activities of guests in their room, a word to the wise that they too could be a noise problem. One woman, who could barely walk and must have been 19 if that, propositioned me as she walked out the elevators with her friends on their way to a club no doubt, granted she was joking. Regardless, the pricepoint and location of this hotel might make it attractive to the young party crowd. With so many accommodation options in Toronto, I just don't think Hyatt Regency makes the grade. I would urge others to stay elsewhere if looking for a truly indulgent stay. This hotel seems to have poor attention to detail, poor cleanliness standards and all-in-all has not impressed me. Especially disappointed with the washroom issue, that is just unacceptable.We ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff--even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty.Initially, I was excited as this was my first time in Puerto Rico. I was equally excited because we had such a good rate on our lodging, flight and hotel via Priceline.com. From the moment we established contact with this establishment, we encountered sub-standard service. Upon our arrival to town, I called the hotel to get directions. I talked to two people who gave me very "vague" directions. My reservation documentation confirmed a check in time of 1pm, yet upon confirming our arrival via phone, we were told that check in time wasn't until 3pm. From this point, throughout the duration of our stay, each day we encountered a sub-standard service, event or occurrence. Upon checking into our room, we found bath towels the size of hand towels, no hand towels or face cloths. The baths towels were the consistency of a dish towel, (very thin and not very absorbent). The room , (and specifically the bathroom) had a musty odor that wouldn't seem to dissipate even after opening windows. Even thought this was a non-smoking room, it reeked of cigarette smoke. The bedspreads and bed linen were visibly soiled Later that evening we encountered ROACHES crawling over our toiletries. When we expressed our horror to the front desk, they provided a nonchalant "sorry about that" and sent the maintenance porter to our room to give us a can of roach spray to console us. The front desk offered to move us to another room for one night, then move us to another room again, (because they were at full capacity, nonetheless, this was an inconvenience solution). Because it was late in the evening, we kept the can of roach spray and stayed in the room. We didn't get much sleep thinking about the roach infestation. As Priceline's policy states no refunds, we were very unhappy with the way this hotel turned out. The next day, we were told by the manager/owner, that we would be moved to another room . He even asked our permission to move our luggage as he would take care of the room transfer while we were out enjoying our vacation. When we arrived back to the room late in the evening, we were told by the desk clerk that the manager told her to tell us that he had our original room thoroughly cleaned and inspected and the he wasn't going to move us and we can stay in the original room. At this point it became obvious that because we were pre-paid, they didn't care about out discontent. We insisted on being moved to another room and the desk clerk finally decided to help and get us moved. The next day, in our better room, my friend awoke to find a roach crawling across the nightstand. Since we were tired of moving, we stayed in this room and continued to arm ourselves with the can of roach spray. We didn't even bother to unpack our bags for fear that roaches would be running through our clothing and belongings. This is very inconvenient when lodging for an entire week. For the rest or our stay, it was one thing after another: a slow drain in the bathroom sink, wound up being a clogged drained, we saw ants in the room, the ice bucket was filthy, and surprisingly, we never saw an ice machine anywhere, (hmmm), I dropped a pair of shorts on the floor by mistake and the dust and dirt that was on my pants was INCREDIBLE, we dare not put our bare feet on the dirty ceramic floor for that reason, we constantly had to ask for extra towels, as they never left face cloths or an adequate amount of the thin bath towels in the room, parking was an issue as they were always surprisingly booked and had more cars than parking spaces, we often had to leave our car keys at the front desk so that the security guard could move our car, because we had to park and block someone in to get a half a space on the parking lot, the garbage receptacles were in plain view in the parking lot and every time you went to and from your vehicle, you smelled the stench of garbage and had to view it overflowing daily, most of the time when we returned to the hotel we had to walk threw a crowd of guests and hotel staff smoking and hanging out directly in front of the main entrance. Lastly, this place is so close to the airport that you constantly hear planes taking off. The planes fly so close that it sounds like they were often taking off on the roof of the hotel. It seemed like the staff at this hotel was used to these types of complaints and were not at all motivated to provide corrective action. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the frustration of trying to be budget conscious and don't stay at this hotel. I witnessed a number of people complaining and demanding a refund. I am a budget traveler by choice, and I have never experienced a 2 star hotel on this level. Heed the warning and save yourselves from "Horror By the Sea"After hearing many great reviews about Venetian, me and my friends decided to give it a try! We traveled with a party of 5 girls for a stagette and stayed from a Friday to Monday. We requested for adjoining rooms at time of booking, and knowing that it’s only a “request” so I called the day before arrival to confirm availability, and was told that we would for sure be getting 2 adjoining rooms and the friendly staff provided me with a confirmation number. We checked in the hotel at around 10 pm on the Friday, and the girl at front desk told us that we weren’t getting adjoining rooms as they usually cost extra and they were all booked up, however, she could “upgrade” us to the Palazzo Tower at a discounted rate of $40-$45 extra per night per room for the adjoining request. We refused to pay extra for something that we were told that was confirmed already, but the girl didn't acknowledge it and never apologized for the misleading information the hotel had provided in the first place, and said the best she could do was to put the two rooms on the same floor, and as she was speaking to us, she was printing out the room cards already when we hadn’t even reached to an agreement. Me and all my friends were all frustrated and tired from our flight, and we told her that we would not be staying at Venetian for our trip if we weren’t given what we had requested (and confirmed on), and another front desk person beside the girl overheard our conversations and pointed at the computer to the girl and said "These adjoining rooms just opened a moment ago- you can put them there", and honestly I don’t even know if they actually had openings and just didn’t want to give them to us because they wanted us to pay extra for the upgrade, but then the approach that the girl was using was just so wrong - she could have just given us the option but not having to force us. Overall, very not impressed with the attitude from the front desk girl that was assisting us that night. We were put in the Venetia Tower (which is a far walk from the lobby, and probably the most dated tower out of the three) and on the 4th floor with a view overlooking a parking lot. The room that I was staying in was fine, but the other room that my friends were staying had nothing that was functioning– none of the electric outlets were working, and the phone and the safe didn’t work either – we placed a service call, and someone came take the phone away to fix it but we never got the phone back., so during the whole trip the 5 of us shared the safe, and they had to come over to our room to use the phone, hair dryer, etc. As for the housekeeping, on the first day the housekeeper didn't replace any of the shampoo/conditioner/lotion, nor any of the wine glasses and cups that were used, and on the second day, both rooms didn’t even get a housekeeping at all!! We called the front desk when we got back to the hotel room around 10 pm on Sunday, and was told that they’d send someone up in 20 minutes, and an hour passed no one showed up, so my friend called again only to find out that they said there was no record of us calling the first place. So we waited again for a while, and still no signs of housekeeping, then we called AGAIN and guess what they told us!? They said that all the housekeepers were busy getting ready for guests that were arriving the next morning so they won't be able to send anyone - but shouldn't they put the GUESTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE HOTEL a priority?! and we really didn’t appreciate the fact that if they were never going to send someone up, just tell us that in the first place, but we had to find that out after 3 calls and couple hours had passed. We ran out of towels that night and were all waiting for the housekeeper to come so we could shower but it never happened so they just sent some extra towels. During the stay, we also called the front desk for a hot water dispenser and it was around $5.00 I believe, and took more than an hour for it to arrive. We called front desk on Monday morning to make a complaint about our overall experience of the stay, and they offered us either a late check out time or a $25 food credit towards each room, which was a total insult. We negotiated and got more food credit towards each room and a late check out but overall, still not impressed with the experience at all and the solution the hotel had offered. Me and my friends have traveled in Vegas many times in the past, and this had to be the worst hotel experience ever. We all were very excited about the trip but the hotel just sort of had it ruined. We will not stay there again and will not recommend to any friends/family.There was only one waiter for the whole restaurant upstairs.The ambiance was pretty cool, but not worth the hassle.Three weeks ago my family went to Saratoga Springs for vacation. We travelled with two small children a 2 year old and a 4 year old. We took advantage of the Disney Magical Express as a means of transporting us from the airport to the resort. We had 5 carry on bags that the driver of the bus took from us and put under the bottom of the bus. When we got to the hotel, I was strapping my youngest son in the stroller while my Mom was tending to my 4 year olds and maneuvering the bags. The driver dropped our bags and took off. By the time I turned around and noticed that two of my bags were not there the driver had already took off. I immediately notified the bellhop and the front desk when I checked it. I provided a description of the driver and our bags. This was 11 p.m. at night. I was given a claims number and told that at the end of the night the driver would return any bags left on the bus to lost and found. I was given a claims number to follow-up. When we reached the room I called and they had no updates. I then called again at 1 a.m. and still no updates. I was then told that I had to wait until the bags show up. One bag contained all our toiletries, diapers prescription medicines etc. The other bag contained our camcorder, digital camera my sons Nintendo DS etc. so I was very concerned that not much seem to happening in recovering my bags quickly. The next day I called numerous times and was given the same answer--no updates. I kept insisting that they need to find the driver and I was told that there is no tracking system to determine which bus they put me on and since I don't know the driver's name it would be difficult for them to figure out. At this point I went to the Saratoga Springs Concierge to speak to a manager to see if they could help me. During my discussions, I was informed that Disney Express is not a "Disney" Company and that I would have to work with Meers Transportation who owns and operates the Disney Express. Keep in mind that these were the same individuals who were not very helpful to begin with. I was told that they would search all the Disney properties to see if the bags show up as a first attack in handling the problem. I kept insisting why they are not looking for the driver of the bus and I repeatedly provided a description of the driver, detail information about the time we got on the bus and the stops the driver made and still no update on the driver. What should have been an exciting vacation and especially for my 4 year old because it was his first trip to Disney, turned into time spent talking on the phone repeatedly, following up with Meers and the Saratoga staff about my lost luggage with no new information on a daily basis. I arrived on a Saturday and it was not until Tuesday did I receive a phone call from someone at Meers transportation about my bag. I was called because my issue was turned over to Meers Claims Department. The gentleman I spoke with expressed surprised that the driver was not located and I again reiterated the same information that I told numerous times before. I provided him with a list of the items I had in the bag and he questioned me as to why I allowed the driver to put my bag under the bottom of the bus if I had so much valuables in there and why I didn't take it with me on the bus if I could take it as a carryon on the plane. I explained that the driver told me to put the bags under the bus so I did. The value of the stuff in both my bags was about $3,500. I did not hear from the claims department on Wednesday as I was told so Thursday afternoon I called and left a message that I was concerned since I was leaving the next day and no one called me back. I received a call back informing me that this is shared liability since I left my bag on the bus. I was also informed that the driver was located and he told them that all the bags that got on the bus got off the bus. I was also told that the driver is a veteran of the company and for all they know those bags did not get on the bus in the first place. I was horrified to be spoken to in such a manner. The claims agent went on to tell me that what they can do is provide me with $250 per bag for a total of $500 and that that amount should be enough for me to cover the deductible on my home owner's insurance. I informed him that that was unacceptable for the value of the things that I had in the bag and I was told and I quote, "I don't know what to tell you, you might want to get a lawyer." I was stunned for the utter disregard for my personal property. I have already loss because the pictures of my children and my family on our camera will never be replaced but to be spoken to in such a manner was appalling. I asked to speak to a supervisor and I was told that a supervisor was not available. I reported the incident to the manager on duty at the time at Saratoga Springs and I was told they would follow-up because they received a voicemail for the claims agent. Interestingly, on my return ride to the airport, I refused to put my bag under the bus and had a confrontation with the driver who informed me that I am required to put my bag under the bus because if the bags shift and hit a passenger they are liable and he could loose his job...Oh the irony because I was berated for putting my valuables under the bus by the claims agent on the one hand and told by the driver on the other hand that it is a requirement. Today is exactly two weeks since I left the Saratoga Springs hotel and I have not heard anything from anyone at Meers Transportation. Since I had recently bought into Disney vacation club, I contacted them to see if and what they can do to assist me in helping to resolve the situation. I am still waiting and I am no closer to finding out what is happening to provide compensation for my property. Needless to say, this was not an ideal vacation because of this situation. While the Saratoga Springs property is nice, I believe the staff did not handle the situation properly in helping me resolve things. I was at the mercy of whoever was the manager on duty at the time that I go to the front desk to inquire. The staff did do two things for me, we received a $50 credit on our account to help purchase necessities such as toothbrush etc in the gift shop/grocery store onsite and I was given a ride to Wal-Mart to buy some replacement for things that were lost that we needed on the trip. Disney "sells" the magic of what they have to offer. However, in the event that things go wrong an individual is at their own mercy. Especially in tough economic times such as these, families are making sacrifices to continue to take vacations when we do so, we expect certain standards to be met and unfortunately the Saratoga Springs (Disney) did not live up to those standards. My recommendation is to find your own means of transportation from the hotel and should you decide to stay on a Disney property be mindful that if things go wrong you could be on your own.Before my fiancee and I left for the Sandos Gala, I was reading trip advisor religiously for 2 months. When we discussed some of the other posts, we thought that maybe the people we just picky, and we didn't plan on eating that much anyway. We only wanted a nice beach, good drinks and decent dinners. (Unfortuantely I didn't know about trip advisor before we booked this hotel.) I don't want to upset anyone that will be staying there, but I think that I should be honest and straightforward so that others who have not booked their hotel yet, choose another hotel. I know this is long, but please read the words of advice. Well, let me start with what would be our worst nightmare! First, when we checked in, it took forever, (we booked a Jr suite in the Haciandas) and then when we got to our room, it was dirty! . They had not cleaned it from the people before us. (Not to mention that we went shopping to kill time and didn't check in until 4:00, check in is at 3:00.) So I called the front desk, just to let them know that after all the delay at check-in, they still gave us a room that was not ready. But I said it was fine, that my fiancee and I would go to the beach to give them time to prepare our room. When we returned the key didn't work, so I kept trying it, and suddenly, some guy opens our door!! He and his fiancee were checked into our room while we were at the beach!! We had all of our suitcases in there, and our shopping bags from PDC, money etc. Thank goodness they were honest people, they didn't touch our things and immediately said that they will vacate the room. When I called the front desk, now very upset, they said that they were taking care of it. They sent a cart, and tried to Downgrade us!! Thank goodness my travel agent made a photocopy of our room voucher proving that we paid for a Jr Suite, b/c they tried to say that we didn't!!! So the other people were moved and they told us that they never booked a suite, they booked a standard room. When I demanded to see the hotel manager, one of the clerks said that they would send us a letter of apology, and did not offer us anything else. Only Olympus Tours gave us a voucher for dinner at Sr. Frogs, and they had nothing to do with the mix-up! Next, we were getting ready for our dinner reservations and in the middle of my fiancee's shower, the water kept shutting off. Also, our shower head was broken, held by a rubber band, so in the middle of the shower, it would switch back and forth from the main head to the little head. The curtain also had mold and a blood stain on it. Then when he was finally done, the power went out in our room. I ran to the Italian restaurant to let them know that we would be late and they said that they would hold the reservation. Then when my fiancee got there, he was wearing shorts and a dress shirt, but they refused to seat us, even though we tried to explain that our power was out and he had to dress in the dark so he took the first thing that he could find. It was also 9:45p.m., barely anyone in there, but he made him go back and change before we could be seated. Now the food---I have never in my life had to spit something out of my mouth in a restaurant, but this was the first! At the Mexican restaurant, the appetizers and soup were good, the steak or what ever it was was so disgusting that I had to spit it into my napkin. At the Italian, my financee got the chicken which was excellent, my fettuchine was gross and the dessert was still frozen. Good cappucino though. I enjoyed the buffets, but I like bland food, my fiancee didn't like the buffets except for breakfast and he love the fresh squeezed oj. (I got sick from the eggs and bacon.) We didn't even bother with the Mediterranean. Room service fried tacos were good, the linguine with meat sauce was nasty. Although, on the bright side, we lost weight on this vacay!! The drinks are excellent, we always tipped, but you don't have to. Ricky is the best bartender and works so hard, if you see him, take care of him please, he's awesome. The beach is beautiful and we loved the adults only pool. Be prepared for a shortage of beach towels. The first day we got them, and turned them in at the end of the day, and everyday after that, even at 8:00a.m., they had no beach towels. By the 4th day of this, I said, "How is this a resort with no towels!! I'm sorry that I didn't want to use the same dirty ones for a week!" They will keep telling you to come back in a half hour. We took the ones from our room for the rest of the week. The animaction team works hard, and they aren't pushy. There is lots of entertainment and activities for those that like to join in. We liked the shows-even if they were a bit cheesy. Lots of fun for the kids-and many activites for them, they like to keep the kids busy and involved. I liked the wholesome family atmosphere, although, for couples like us, I would suggest another resort. Words of advice: --make a copy of your room voucher! Once you give it to them at check-in, you have nothing to prove what you paid for. If I hadn't had that, they probably would have downgraded us and not the people who paid for the standard room. --bring some snacks, or be prepared to go into town for meals. La Parilla was really good, but the service was awful. The best restaurant in town was Negrosa! Incredible Italian food and great drinks. Not cheap though. --keep your beach towels on the first day. Chances are, they won't have them again. --get up early if you want a palypa, by 8:00 a.m. they are all reserved. My fiancee and I joked about how awful this resort was, and how we made light of all the other negative trip advisor comments before we went there. But they were not kidding!! We don't expect that much, but this was beyond poor, especially when we paid extra for a suite for just the two of us, because we thought that perhaps, we might get better service. If you haven't booked yet I strongly urge you to consider other resorts. This is our 3rd time to PDC, we enjoy trying different resorts. I loved the Riu Tequilla-but it's not on the beach. The Paraisus Riviera Cancun, in Puerto Morelos was absolutely beautiful, and a jr suite gets you outstanding service and a private pool with your own bartender and waiters. It is a bit out of the way though, about 35 minutes north of PDC. As for next year, at least we know where NOT to go!Where do I start? we booked this hotel through hotwire and once we found out it was the Westin, we were so excited. We arrived at 12 midnight after a long drive from San Diego to Desert Hill Premium outlet and then to LA.Since we arrived late, we were given a room on the 12th floor. This is considered the executive club level, again very excited. the excitement lasted only a few minutes. We were staying at this hotel for 5 nights, so we unpacked everything( we had also, done lots of shopping at the outlet mall and had bags and bags of stuff, un-packed all those). We entered the room and it was so old looking an the floor was so dirty. By 12:45 I go downstairs to ask if there is a place to get a coffee and the front desk told me that unfortunately there isn't any place available at this time! I go back to the room and start reading the booklets in the room, to my surprise , it says the bar downstair is open till 1:30 and has variety of speciality coffees!!! So i attempted to make coffee in the room, well, the coffee machine had water in it from the previous person, and it would shut off every 30 seconds, so it took me 4-5 attempts to make a cup of coffee. the top of coffee maker was so filthy and disgusting that I had to take a picture of! anyways, i could not get a decent coffee. Then, I went to brush my teeth and noticed the sink is clogged and there is a horrible smell coming from it.( remember, this room was supposed to be cleaned before we got there, not sure how the cleaning staff cleaned there and did not open the water in sink!!). I called the service express and they sent their engineer to check on it. it is already 1:30 in the morning!!! Sonny the engineer comes up( such a great guy) and spent another almost 2 hours in our bathroom. I had to stay up for this whole time, at the end he said it is not fixable and we have to switch rooms,by this time the horrible smell is all over our room, you could hardly breath!b He asked us not to use the sink either, My husband had already fallen asleep so I called the front desk and made them aware of the situation. I told them that we will be changing our room in the morning since my husband is asleep. She said she will call me in the morning to tell me which room is assigned to us.I set the alarm at 7:30 so I can pack everything again and be ready for our 8:30 room change. I got up, packed and went to take a shower , believe it pr not, my body touched the shower curtain and there is a huge nose mucus( BOOGIE!). I almost threw up! anyways, got out of shower as soon as I could, since the water was so cold too! anyways, no one calls until a little pass 8:30 I call the front desk to ask about the room number, well, they had no idea what I was talking about! finally, they said after 12 pm they will have a room on the 12th floor, we packed everything and left for universal. Came back at 11 pm and they had given us a room on the 11th floor. By then I am furious at everything with the hotel. To compensate for all these, they had given us a suite with a terrace but to get to the room, it took you a while to get from the elevator to your room as the room was at the end of a connecting hallway. also, what am I gonna do with a terrace by the airport in December? So I go downstairs and wait in the preferred line to be served! with no one in front of me, it took them 20 minutes to serve me,actually they didn't. I just walked in front of the other line waiting to be checked in. The guy was so rude an arrogant that I had to ask for the night manager, I explained to her what had happened and she was very nice and understanding. At the end, we were given free internet and free valet parking for our whole stay( we had already started using both accepting the charges). Also, there is a coffee stand in the lobby, the only place that serves Starbucks coffee. you go there at 10 am and she says she is closed!!! Also, in the booklet in the room was a list for complimentary things you could ask. I asked for hair spray and a sewing kit and they didn't have either one. also , the cleaning lady did not clean the bathroom floor or any other floor for that matter. I guess they don't vacuum everyday. Just make your bed and put new soap and shampoo! In this trip I stayed at 2 other hotels and they both were amazing( hilton La Jolla San Diego and Hotel Nikko San Francisco union square). This by far was the worst hotel I had every stayed at. Except Jennifer the night manager, Sonny the engineer and another lady/girl at the front desk in the morning, everyone else demonstrate a less than satisfactory service. I Will never ever go back to this place. ever! and make sure no one I know would not go there either.Tables are close, so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons.Since we were only paying Â£17 each per night for this hotel I wasn't expecting much. I wasn't expecting the room to be big. I wasn't expecting the room to be comfy. I was expecting the room to be clean and for the staff to be at least a little interested in the quality of their guests' stay. Apparently even this was too much to ask. To start off our awful experience, we arrived at the hotel after midnight, so nobody was in the reception to give us our key. Instead we had to phone another hotel and let them know we we had arrived. When I phoned I was told I would have to come and pick up my keys from the other hotel. When I asked how to get there I was told there should be directions on the door of the Earl's Court Gardens hotel. There was an arrow pointing right. When I told the man on the phone that that was all there was he proceeded to reel off a list of directions and then got annoyed at me when I had to ask him to repeat the directions, since we had gone the wrong way and had gotten lost. After all that we finally got to the other hotel and, after settling our bill and paying the key deposit, we were given the key to our room. There was a slight confusion with our money ("What's this?" "Pounds stirling. It's Scottish money" "Do you have any British money?" "Last time I checked Scotland was part of Britain") but to be honest I should have expected that since I usually run into problems with Scottish money when visiting England. There was also a problem considering we owed Â£68 but did not have change. We gave the receptionist Â£70 and were given a note explaining that we would have to collect our Â£2 change from our hotel the next morning and that there would be somebody there from 7am to make sure we got our change. The real problems started when we got into the hotel. We found room 203 with no difficulties, even if it was a bit of a squeeze to get through the doors even with our tiny suitcase. When we got into the room I had to cry. At first glance it looked clean but as soon as we looked up it was a different story. As well as several damp patches on the ceiling there was also a stain which, in the poor lighting we had, we were unable to identify. We decided it was either mould or poo. Either way it was very unpleasant. After this discovery we started inspecting the rest of the room a bit more thoroughly. The wallpaper was coming off the walls in places and the carpet was stained pretty badly underneath the bed. One window did not have curtains and the curtains on the other window were falling off. I opened the cupboard to hang up a dress and changed my mind as soon as I saw how grotty the inside of the cupboard was. If it hadn't been so late we would have left right then and found somewhere else. On top of that there's also the fact that our room looked out onto railway tracks. This meant that we didn't get to sleep until roughly 2am when the trains stopped going past and were woken at 6am when they started again. All in all a very poor night's sleep. We decided it was not worth staying in this hotel any longer. We phoned travel lodge and booked a room at their Farringdon hotel (which ended up costing us over Â£100 we had not been planning on spending), since we at least knew that it would be clean, and got ready to check out. This is when we discovered that on top of everything else the hot water was not working in the shower, the taps did not switch off and there was no soap for washing your hands in the bathroom. We got to the reception at 8.30am (an hour and a half after we were told that there would be someone there with money) and found it unmanned. After a quick call to the main hotel the receptionist dragged himself out of bed to serve us. He told us we would be able to get a refund for the night we were not staying but that there would be no money on the premises until 10.30am when the manager (who we never saw once during the whole ordeal) arrived. This seemed pretty poor to me, especially since the latest you're supposed to be able to check out is 11am and you have to get your Â£10 key deposit back. I think they just intend to scam an extra Â£10 out of many of the tourists who stay there. So we handed back the key and filled out a form saying why we were unhappy with our stay (which I refused to sign until I got my money back) and went and had breakfast at the nearby Sainsbury's. At 10.30am we returned. The receptionist told us several times to be patient and wait longer before walking out the door and coming back with some money. However since another couple were wanting to check out by this time he served them first and had to leave again to get the rest of our money. When he returned he gave me the form I had filled out back. When I reminded him that I wasn't signing anything until I got my money he said "No. You sign here and write 'No complaint' and I give you your money back. Trust me. Right 'No Complaint' otherwise it looks bad for me and I lose my job". After arguing about this with him for several minutes (because I had a fair few complaints about the room and the customer services) I finally wrote 'No complaint' on the form and we were given our money back. Except for the Â£2 change which then caused a further argument (I know it's not much but by this point it was the principle of the thing that made me do it). When we left we realised they'd given us all our Scottish notes back, which was the only laugh we got out of the whole thing. Throughout the whole ordeal the receptionist did not apologise once except for a monotonous "Sorry for your inconvenience" as we walked out the door. So two and a half hours after we first lodged a complaint and checked out (and four hours after we were told we'd be able to be served), we were able to leave. If I had one piece of advice about staying at this hotel it would be "Don't". The rooms are disgusting and the staff couldn't care less about customer satisfaction. I wouldn't wish this hotel on my worst enemy.I think you have to a bit of a traveler to realize how bad this hotel is. The fact that the beach in front of the hotel stinks, is mud not sand and is not actually a usable beach might be of interest to those who look forward to days playing in the water or snorkeling. This fact seems to have escaped some. We read the reviews before planning a vacation at this resort but never found the beach problem mentioned (nor the maintenance issues.) Apparently the beach was washed away in one of the big hurricanes some years back and is now not usable for swimming. There are some shaded chairs etc. on the imported and sandbaggedm beach but I think you have to be a nightstalker to get one before the mysterious towels reserve them for a group or couple who never seem to show up. We were never able to a) find a chair after 7:30 a.m and b) one with shade (at the beach or the pools.) In actual fact there is virtually no shade anywhere in the main pool area. We never tried the smaller pool as it was a long ways from our building and we always needed to be near our room to make sure the next maintenance man showed up and had actually fixed whatever was the problem of the day. This big property is not well maintained and the number of guests we spoke to who had NOT had a maintenance nightmare were few and far between. In fact we felt quite at home (with our badge of honor of having to move twice in 8 days. We were not the king and queen but at least in the royal family of the most moved) We chatted with many, many other guests who had been moved at least once because of broken A/C units etc. One lady was moved after two days because her water kept shutting off in her room and she couldn't shower or clean up. This maintenance nightmare even included owners who had bought weeks at the hotels Vacation Club (we met a family who came every year because they had bought a large block of the Vacation Club and they had moved or been forced to endure maintenance nightmares each year) The Vacation Club (not time share) is the biggest scam I have ever seen. You have to buy weeks (the sell is that you have a price fixed into the future for a hotel room.) What they don't make a big deal of is that it costs a fortune to buy your "all inclusive meals" (which are mandatory and cost from $40 - $60 per day per person. You do the math on how expensive this is.) Anyone who buys here gets to stay in the same poorly maintained rooms and deal with the same management and staff who uniformly had no real answers (other than to move you to another poorly maintained room.) Of course this never actually addresses the broken A/C, tub, laundry line, fan, switch, TV, Internet, lack of water or or broken shower nozzle etc. We stayed 8 days and were moved twice. When we were moved the first time they upgrade us (because no other rooms were available) but were forced to pay $25 per day for the up grade. This was extremely unprofessional and shows the lack of customer care built into this hotels staff and management. The painful thing was that each time they upgraded us to a room it was just as bad as the first but with a nice swim up pool right out the patio door. Of course the A/C still didn't work, my wife had a severe electrical shock from a switch for the room fan, the TV was a mess the "pay for view movies" were a mess to get and get in English (we had a maintenance man (we got to know him well in just 8 short days) visit three times in one evening just to get the Pay Per View options on the TV.) The food at this hotel has to been qualified as an adventure in mediocrity. They have all these "special" restaurants with different themes which require you to reserve your table the day before (which can be a problem if you are on a long tour.) Also there is no gurantee the reservation is any good since we met a family of 9 who were having a family reunion at the resort who showed up at the appropriate time for their reservation at the Italian restaurant and were told the reservation was cancelled since the Italian restaurant was over booked for the night. We met them in line at the Steak House where they showed us the slip proving the reservation. They were also turned away from the Steak House and we are not sure if they ever got anything to eat. These SPECIAL (and I use the term loosely) restaurants include French, Mexican, Italian, Asian, Sea Food (which is not actually a restaurant but just the other half of the Steak House) and the Steak House. We ate in the Mexican, Italian and Steak House. The first two were absolutely awful and mediocre at best. The steaks in the steak house won't win any awards but were acceptable. The buffets were the best place to eat. The food was fair and the morning and afternoon buffet at the restaurant by the main pool it even verged on good at times. If you have stayed at other all inclusives you may have liked the room service option. If you use it at this hotel you are charged $12 every time you have food or drinks brought to your room. Also room service is from 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m (from 11:00 p.m to 6:00 a.m there is a very, very limited menu of about 4 items, and none of them real food, that you can get.) The period from 6:00 a.m to 11:00 a.m is not covered under the room service option (so forget special breakfast in bed plans.) If you are an Internet junky you will need to pay $15 a day for Internet service in you your room. You can use the other option of sitting in a big, dark room they call the Sports Bar and conduct your business in front of God and everyone. Or you can use the lobby and really make it public. I can honestly say that this hotel is the hotel from hell. My wife and I have lived and travelled all over the world. We have stayed in "all inclusives" in other places in Mexico and the Carribean and have not found property this bad anywhere else on the planet. It would be a wonderful present to find that this hotel had been beamed to another universe and could cause no more pain on this earth. If this review isn't clear enough then let me say DON'T EVER, EVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!First, I am not a snobby tourist who pays for cheap hotels but expects total luxury. I grew up camping and backpacking, staying in cheap and seedy hotels, and just being excited to have a hot shower....so a stay at a hilton is luxury to me! That being said....I recently had an experience at the LV Hilton that I am never going to forget! Let me briefly set the scene....I was really excited to go to Vegas for two reasons: 1) I'd never been there and 2) I was going to Vegas to get married. I lived in Florida and my fiance is a sailor in the navy, stationed in California. So Vegas was a nice neutral place to throw two families together. My family isn't made of money, so we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel, that was comfortable, but wouldn't break the bank for anyone coming to the wedding. The Hilton had solid reviews and a good price tag. So away we went! I arrived with my family a day before my fiance got into Vegas. We checked in, I received 2 full beds instead of 2 queens, which was sort of annoying, but I'm not picky. Our main complaint at this point was that our entire wedding party (twenty people and about 12 rooms) were scattered all over the hotel. We booked a solid 2 months ahead, and called two weeks, and a week before we got there to make sure that our rooms were together. They never were...but oh well! That first night I went to bed and woke up at roughly 6 am to a sound that I can only describe as a mix between a jet engine and an earthquake. At first I thought it was the air conditioner, so I played with that, to no avail. Then I figured out it was the pipes. I went into the bathroom and played with the faucet on the bathtub until I thought I had figured out how to make it go away. It did it again at 8 am when I was in the bathtub...there I am in the tub relaxing and all of a sudden I thought a plane was about to take off in my hotel room. It stopped after about 5 minutes and a lot of jiggling with the faucet. So the next day my fiance got in, I hadn't seen him in 2 months and all I wanted to do was lay in our hotel room and spend some time together. We went to sleep at around 11 and at 2 am the plane decided to take off again in our room, it scared the bejesus out of my fiance and I proceeded to bound out of bed into the cold hotel room to play with the faucet on my bathtub. It did it again at 6 am and at this point we were just too tired and annoyed to care and just laid there for the 5 minutes until it decided to go away by itself. I had given up on the idea of sleeping well anytime in the next 3 days but my father found out about our room and got us a new one. We packed up our stuff that afternoon and headed over to our new room. We had places to go and wedding stuff to do so we just dropped our luggage off in the room and took off. We had dinner at Hard Rock that night with my family (loads of fun, they made us stand on top of chairs and blow out a candle on a sundae when they found out we were getting married, and I'll never forget my entire family doing YMCA along with the music as long as I live) and then KA (at the MGM Grand....if youve got the money...go see it!!!!!!). We got back pretty late from KA, at around 12:30 at night, and just wanted to get into our bed and sleep. We got back to the hotel and I walked straight to my luggage and my fiance went into the bathroom to pee. At that instant he yelled "did you leave the sink running???!!!"...."ummmm no" I said, and came over to see what he was talking about. The tile floor in our bathroom and leading into our bedroom was covered in water. At that moment I put two and two together. When we had first gotten into the new room I noticed what looked like silt on the inside of the sink. I thought nothing of it and just rinsed out the sink and the black silt and left. When we found the room flooded I figured it out, our sinks had backed up and overflown. So I sent him down to get us a new room and packed all out stuff back up for the second move of our 3 day trip. They wouldn't give him the keys because the room was under my name...at this piont I was getting annoyed and went back downstairs with him to get us a new room. The woman was nice, but...well...when I told her our room was flooded...she said "do you need a new room right now??" and I, in the most polite way I could muster, said "let me explain, our room is flooded, as in both sinks are filled with water and our floor is covered with water...its completely unusable". So....they upgraded us to a second floor luxury room....and by 1:30 we made it into our new room. It was impressive to say the least.....two flat screen tv's, marble sinks and tile, a walk in shower with a waterfall showerhead, down pillows and comforter, a living room area, and a king size bed. But before we got to bed, we throughly walked through and inspected the room, because my fiance and I were absolutly convinced there had to be something wrong with it. Well we didn't find anything and had an excellent nights sleep. Now you would think this would be the end of our adventure at the LV Hilton, but you would be sooooo wrong. We got up that morning, with only enough time to take a shower before we had to head off. So we decided to save time and simply take a shower together. We got in and lathered up, but we had left the sliding door to the shower/toilet room open (it was seperate from the sinks). My fiance wanted to close it so we could get some nice sauna/hot air action going on in the shower. So he popped out, half in the shower, half out, and gently pulled the lever on the sliding door to shut it. Well it shut...and when it did, 3 tiles came flying off the wall in the shower at me. I screamed and then started laughing....there's what we were looking for last night....there HAD to be something wrong with the room. He wanted to get out immediately but it was just some broken tile and we really didnt have time to deal with it, so I just pushed it into a corner with my foot. We continued our nice shower, although, we often accidently stepped on a peice of tiny broken tile I had missed. When my father checked us out he told them what had happened, with all three rooms, and they did give us 7 buffet vouchers.....but I honestly just don't think that was enough. I had to laugh though, no one else in our wedding party had quite the time that we did...there stays were all quite normal and I was happy for that. So, that being said, I'm not sure how to sum up my experience with the LV Hilton. It is a hotel that is certainly showing it's age, that is certain. Are you guaranteed an experience anywhere close to mine? No....but the thing to remember....is that it is possible....because it happened to me. Some people might think I made this up.....but I don't think I could have made this experience up if I tried!Have just returned to the UK having spent 4 nights at the Wellington booked through Thomas Cook and we can confidently say we will not be booking another trip with Thomas Cook and when we do return to NYC we will not be staying at the Wellington! This holiday was a disaster from start to finish. The only positives were NYC and British Airways (surprising I know)! We arrived at the Hotel having been collected by a Thomas Cook representative (who later claimed she didn't work for TC but was quite happy to collect her commission from selling various tours) - there was no register or check conducted to make sure everyone was collected, and we later heard of couples who had been left at the airport or left at the hotel. On check in we learned that no room had been reserved for us and after lenghty conversations with both the TC rep and the Hotel Manager a room was found for us for two nights, but with no guarantee of anything further. We were told our rep would resolve this by the time we arrived for the NY City Tour the following morning. Initally, we were offered the option of sharing a suite with another couple we had never met before, who were in precisely the same predicament as we were. The room we were given for our first night was quite frankly a disgrace and looked nothing like the pictures on the website, or brochure that we saw - we can only assume these images were of the penthouse suite. The room was dirty, worn, badly in need of redecoration, the bed sheets had not been ironed and looked creased and possibly slept in (!?) the bathroom was cramped and again looked unclean and to top it off the pipes banged throughout the night making sleep virtually impossible. The following morning we got up and resolved to make the best of our situation, after all, the room would have been sorted and we had our tour to look forward to. On meeting our rep in the lobby she presented us with the TC booking reference and assured us that by simply showing this at reception a room would be found for us. Alas, this was not the case the Welington's manager said it was not their booking reference and their was no reference of us on their system. As such he could only guarantee us accommodation for another night and then by taking a copy of our credit card. We then spoke to the TC rep, afterall she would be able to speak to the manager and either arrange a return flight home or alternate accommodation. At least that is what we though a TC rep would do...but of course she doesn't work for TC and as such "emphathised with our situation but had done all she could...." With no help from the rep and no help from the Hotel Manager, we asked to make a phone call to TC in the UK. Obviously the hotel would allow us to dial TC or our rep would provide us with the faclities to do so...but NO! We had to pay to call the UK, no phone was provided for us, instead we had to use a combination of our mobile phone and phone cards. With the situation unresolved we were then unable to go on our booked tour (as to do so would mean all UK offices would have been closed and we would have been trusting in the compentency of the Hotel staff to resolve everything by our return). After speaking to the UK and wasting an entire morning, buying phone cards, using public phones, and being passed from pillar to post, the Hotel Manager then phoned us to say he had been able to arrange for a King Size Room - an upgrade...this was after having been told that no rooms were available. I would just like to stress at this point that not once were we offered an apology and we found both the TC rep and hotel staff to be rude and unfriendly. We then had to move our bags from our old room to the new one. The Kingsize room was OK, but not what you would expect from a supposed superior option. It was essentially the same as our previous room but larger, with a slightly less frequent melody coming from the pipes. Our holiday then improved as we spent the vast majority of our time out and about and as far away from the Hotel as possible. Our transfer back to the JFK airport from the hotel went fairly smoothly, until check in at the airport where no record was found of any of our parties bookings. Therefore not everyone was able to be booked onto the flight and had to be diverted to Heathrow. Hardly, the perfect end to your holiday and not what you want after about 12 hours of travelling. We will be seeking appropriate compensation from TC for the shambles we experienced and will update this review with the outcome. To sum up - New York is an amazing city and really is a must to experience, however if you do go - don't use Thomas Cook and certainly do not stay at The Wellington.I dont normally write reviews--neither when the service is great nor when it is aweful, despite the fact I travel over 50% of the time with my job. I do read Trip Advisor with regularity though, and often follow the advice i find there. Nonetheless, I cannot help but plead with the reader not to reward this type of establishment with your business. First of all, I was headed to Vegas for a trip I make every year for the opening rounds of the NCAA tournament. Everything I had heard (and I am sure you have too), is that the biggest and and best of Vegas was the Wynn/Encore. I booked on Hotwire for 145 night and couldnt have been more excited. Everything was great until we set foot inside. The Service We arrived early and were told that our room wasnt available. Hey, I understood that, it was a high turnover day and they needed some time to get a room clean. Not the best of starts but certainly nothing to complain over. They put my name on a list and assured me then would call my cell when the first room was clean. After watching literally probably a hundred people check out, I inquired again. It was the type of service we would come to know at the Wynn--too busy to help or be bothered. They again sent me away. Rather than leave, we decided to head to the SportsBook, the reason we had come to Vegas in the first place. There, we were told that all the seats in the Sportsbook itself were reserved, and that only seats in an adjacent bar area were available. This was a little disappointing, but again, nothing that bad. So we sat at the adjacent bar area. Now there was literally NO ONE in the Sportsbook yet, but we couldnt sit in any of the seats. We also came to find out that you couldnt get a complimentary drink in the Sportsbook unless you made a $300 bet--and then only one drink coupon!! I do this trip every year and have never ever heard of such a thing!! When I told my other friends also staying at the property about it, they didnt even believe me until they arrived and found the same thing, only when they arrived they couldnt even sit at the adjacent bar area because all those seats had now been reserved!! In case you are curious about how much drinks costs, try about 6 bucks for a beer and about 13 for a mixed drink. We didn't stay long--we went down to the Venetian (where we stayed last year) and they greeted us with open arms. We tried the pool at Wynn, but there were no seats available. We could see from our room that the pool at the Encore had space, but were told that we werent allowed over there, even though the phone representative said we would have access to both properties. Upon checking out, they told us we had over $100 in mini bar charges, even though we hadn't touched a thing. A manager had to come inspect the bar and he told us that its all "weighted" and that if you bump into it, it automatically charges you. He even said that most people don't even check out and don't even realize it until they get home and it is always a big hassle for them (the biggest and best resort in Vegas nickel and diming you--what a joke!) The Rooms. If you look online, you will think a relatively large and rather plush room awaits your arrival. I am going to be honest. I used the word Hampton Inn to describe the rooms to at least 5 other guests and all agreed. That was about the size and quality of the rooms. I will say the bathrooms were oversized and had a separate shower and bath, but that was about it. I didn't even see how the online depictions were even close to what we got when we arrived. We did have an amazing view of the golf course and pool areas, but that was it. Some final thoughts. I understand that they Wynn drops their rack rate to get rid of excess rooms on Howire, so it is very tempting to book there. You think 5 star resort for so cheap, so why not. I am trying to remember everything else bad that happened as I write this, but nothing else is coming to mind. I just cannot say enought bad things about this place. There is no way they will fix it if people continue to come, so I would plead with other readers not to reward this type of service with your business. I had read on Trip Advisor of other readers who stayed here and had similar experiences, but until you experience just how bad it is, you cannot fathom how indeed poor it is. Oh yeah I just thought of another thing. When the Sportsbook opened for betting on one of the busiest betting days of the year, there was only 1 person taking bets--there were more than 10 windows, but only 1 person taking bets. The line was over 200 people deep and STILL they didnt bother to add additional staff. What kind of preparation was that? I will tell you, the type that simply doesnt care. They have enough business, that they dont need the little guys, which I will admittedly say that I am. I dont make huge bets, but I do gamble, just not enough for Mr. Wynn to take notice. Another thing I remembered. I had forgotten my Blackberry charger. Now admittedly I have dont this a million time when traveling, but because the cast number of chargers that are left at hotels, they ALWAYS have a few extra. At the Wynn, however, acquiring one was not so easy. In fact, despite the fact that they said they indeed did have one, they refused to offer it to me because the Concierge desk had not opened yet! When the Concierge desk did open, I was told that they could not let me use a charger that someone had left because they donate them all to CHARITY?!?!?!? I guess the charities in Vegas are in dire need on Blackberry chargers these days. The ones in Houston need food, in Vegas they need Blackberry chargers (at least according to Mr. Wynn). I almost forgot one of the mosty disgusting things, but I called a fellow guest to make sure I didnt leave anything out here. One day, after what the Wynn refers to as Housekeeping cleaned our room, we came back to shower for the evening. There was something that closesly resembled feces and/or mildew on the towels they left hanging on the rack. This was not only on one towel, but on both of the towels they had left hanging for us. THe made who replaced them was like "Oh yeah, that happens all the time, here are some new ones" If it happens all the time then why are you looking for whatever it is and ensuring that your guests arent having to find it for themselves. I kid you not, at first I thought it was some kind of a joke. It was so disgusting. Despite all these issues, we never received a single call from anyone attempting to apologize for anything. So again, I implore you to invoke the most powerful weapon in the traveler's arsenal, the abillity to simply book another hotel. In this economy especially, one would think customer service in a customer based business would be paramount--this is simply not the case at the Wynn/Encore Las Vegas.We stayed at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and Towers while a friend was running in the Boston Marathon. My review should be read in the context of being overtaxed by marathoners and their families, but also note that I donâ€™t complain much about things. In fact, this is my first review, since I was so dissatisfied with our accommodations in an expensive hotel. When I read what is below, I figured I was some whining snob, but thatâ€™s simply not my bag, baby. Give me â€œclean, safe, and (relatively) quietâ€� in a hotel, and I donâ€™t gripe much. These were not descriptors Iâ€™d use for this particular stay. To begin with, parking was atrocious. The valet parking was poorly labeled, and we circled the building three times until my wife finally dropped me off to go inside and ask. The problem was that the valets all wear the same outfit for every establishment in that area, so it's impossible to discern for whom they work until you see their sign. The Park Plaza's sign is poorly visible. If you're wondering, you need to pull up in front of McCormick & Schmicks. What appears upon casual observation to be the valet parking for that restaurant is actually for the hotel. When asking for assistance, with my wife parked on the street waiting for me to return, I was funneled through the busy lobby and forced to wend my way through the interior of the building via repeated requests of help from folks in order to find the parking center, which was unfortunately on the opposite side of the building. Once I got there and tried to clarify that this was the correct place, the valet captain was rude and dismissive. His staff, though, was very cordial and responsive once we pulled up in the correct place. Once inside, the desk staff was pleasant and helpful, though were not well-informed. Despite our having confirmed everything repeatedly prior to arrival, and having electronic confirmation, they were not quite sure what to do with us when we arrived. We eventually (after about 20 minutes of computer acrobatics by the desk staff) got the room we had confirmed rather than one half its size. Throughout this 20 minute wait, our bags were taken by the Bell captain to his desk, where he left it unattended for almost the entire time in the midst of a busy lobby. He was offended when I walked over by it, and said Iâ€™d like to keep an eye on our luggage since my wifeâ€™s laptop was in the computer bag on the trolley, reassuring me that heâ€™d â€œtake care of it for meâ€�, though as soon as I walked away, he became engaged in another conversation and walked away from it. The room was not a bad size; with a breathtaking view of â€¦ the building next door. Literally, the building obstructing our view was about 30 feet from us, so it felt almost cozy to open the shades and see what the neighbors were wearing and what they were watching on television. Indeed, if our windows had opened, we could have just listened to their TV and not had to turn ours on at all. The room was not particularly clean either, with sizeable stains on the sofa (neither my wife nor I planned on drinking enough alcohol at any point during our trip to adventure sitting on whatever that once was) and on the carpet. The bathrooms were small and dingy, but the showers, hallelujah! Well, my wife said herâ€™s (yes, we had two bathrooms for some reason) was â€œaverageâ€�, but mine was a revelation. Two showerheads with impressive water pressure and sensitive controls made this a â€œdestination showerâ€� in my mind. Not worth the $284 a night we spent to be there, but almost. If my goal had been to stay in the shower the entire visit, Iâ€™d be recommending this hotel to you without reservations. Take that for what itâ€™s worth in your hierarchy of needs. The elevators were inconsistent and felt borderline unsafe at times, though to be fair we never actually hurtled to our deaths. They were just slow and jerky, but not likely fatal. Of course, after the marathon, there were lines snaking around the hotel lobby waiting for the elevators, so we took the stairs to the eighth floor, which most of the marathoners were understandably less willing to do than my wife and I, who havenâ€™t run a combined total of 26.2 miles during our cumulative lifetimes. Weâ€™re lazy on a day-to-day, but not a minute-to-minute basis, it would seem. Food service was hilariously overpriced ($90 for a case of Budweiser â€“ no I didnâ€™t drink anything, I was just stunned by the price as I was looking through the menu), with no minibar option to at least put the egregiously priced food in your room so that you didnâ€™t have to wait 45-60 minutes to pay too much for hotel food. Additionally, the room service staff taking our order was impressively rude and dismissive when told of a serious food allergy. However, the person delivering our order was exceedingly pleasant and courteous. So, too, was the housekeeping staff. When checking out, you are instructed to contact the Valet service 30 minutes in advance to have your car waiting for you upon departure. We did so, and it was still not ready nearly 45 minutes after our call. That, though, was not the insult. Upon our arrival home, my wife noted several ink marks on the dash, where clearly the Valet service had been holding a pen in his hand and written on the dash in several spots. Perfect! Not only did it cost $38 a night to have our car there, but they also wrote all over the dash. Aces! I would definitely recommend against staying in this hotel upon your trip to Boston, unless youâ€™ve got more money than you can spend in other, more productive ways.Actually, everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.The fajita we tried was tasteless and burned and the mole sauce was way too sweet.My husband and I celebrated our 5th anniversary. We wanted to go to somewhere special. When we booked through a discount online vacation company were promised 10 days/ 9nights of pampering and fun from this 5 star resort. When we arrived the resort was beautiful and tropical looking. It's a sprawling resort. If you don't ask for a bungalow/ room near the main building you need to walk quite a bit. We didn't mind the pleasant walk. We also noticed there were many families w/ young children. We are not against kids at all (we have 2 ourselves), we are just saying that if you are expecting a "couple's only" resort- you have picked the wrong resort. There is a main building that houses the check-in desk, several restaurants, a shop, large lounge areas with several bars. The main building is surrounded by several smaller buildings/ bungalos, pools, beach and beautifully manicured grounds. One of the highlights of our trip was watching the (several) beautiful iguanas walking around the resort and sunning themselves during the day. They are completely harmless and are very tame creatures. We were able to get pretty close to some of them. Our standard garden style room was larger than we expected- king sized bed, sliders leading to a little patio, larger than normal bathroom and beautiful marble everywhere. As we were unpacking our nightmare began. Our room was without hand and wash towels, no hangers, the tv/ cable was broken and we were missing a coffee maker-coffee items were there on the table. We called the front desk and asked for a supervisor. We explained what was missing and broken. She assurred us that she would take care of immediately. She offered to give us a computer cable free of charge for the trouble we had. The price for renting a cable was only $7.00. Looking back, for what we went though it wasn't worth the free cable! While waiting for someone to take care of our missing/ broken items we went to the beach. The main beach was crowed with families so we walked to an area of the beach that wasn't as crowded but still part of the resort. There were plenty of lounge chairs. However, we were speechless. There was trash/ broken glass every where, a tire tread and plastic cooler sticking out of the sand. When we went back to our room we were greeted by several resort staff asking what was missing/ broken. We told them what was heeded. Someone looked at our tv and said that it was the cable box. So he took it . Someone else came back with a coffee maker however it was broken. Someone else came with several beach towels instead of wash/ hand towels. Someone else came with 3 hangers- that's all they had! You ask why did it take that many people to take care of our issues? We had wondered the same. By late night we were still missing several items and there was no coffee for the morning. That morning I (again) called the front desk, maintenance, and housekeeping asking for our missing/ broken items. We only recieved a working coffee maker and more than enough beach towels. I don't know if they just didn't understand what hand/ wash clothes are or if they just didn't have any to give. Several days and calls later, we gave up asking. We were here for a vacation, we were not going to take time asking (pointlessly) for our items. We were going to do the best with what we had. One of the mornings we were awakened by our fire alarm going off requesting us to leave our room. When we left we saw other guests standing around and asking each other "whats going on?". Several minutes pasted the alarm was still sounding and there was not one Gran Melia staff or security person came to address it or to check for our safety. After 30 minutes went by we all decided to go back in our room. Gran Melia staff didn't care or check for our safety so it must have been a false alarm. We were never given an explanation. Each day we kept going to the beach but was very cautious where we walked. As long as we had a lounge chair and our books we were happy. Our meals were nothing fantastic for the price we paid. All the waite staff was always pleasant and helpful. We tried all the restaurants. For breakfast there is only one restaurant open. If you didn't have a vacation deal (we did) which has breakfast free, guests paid $22.00/ PP buffett style. Average dinner meals for two w/ two appetizers, two main meals and non- alcoholic drinks were over $100.00 not including tip. We didn't have any desserts since the main meal was nothing to write home about. For lunch we ate at the grill near the pool. There was one other restuarant if guests wanted to eat in. Lunch for 2 w/out alcoholic drinks and dessert averaged $20 without tip. The restuarant that we were not impressed with and only went once was the Asian restaurant. The chef cooks in front of the guests (which was fun for the kids) and the dishes were all the same but with a choice of meat/ fish. Just before leaving for our plane we were still missing wash/ hand towels- but still had plenty of beach towels! We only had 3 hangers for the two of us, our tv worked but we couldn't watch movies because they took our broken cable box! We have never had such poor service. For issues as simple as ours we couldn't understand why there was not one Gran Melia person or supervisior that could just take the reins and resolve our issues. Yes, there were plenty of "I'm sorry, someone will take care of this or I'll take care of these issues myself"!My husband and I just returned (December 7, 2004) from what was supposed to be a one week vacation in Cancun, Mexico. It was less than 24 hours long. We had exchanged into the Mayan Palace (Riviera Maya) through RCI. I foolishly walked into the Mayan Palace wearing three beautiful rings (including my wedding ring - all worth a total of in excess of $20,000). The hotel lobby and the Grand Mayan suite we were given after our RCI unit was changed was beautiful. All the employees were gracious and helpful. "M" checked us into the hotel. She and a colleague admired my rings. I appreciated "M" changing the unit we had been assigned, to the Grand Mayan, a beautiful suite on the ground floor. I tipped the bell boys (who held our luggage while we checked in and then reloaded us into a shuttle van to take us to our unit) from a travel folder which contained more than 50 $1.00 bills. I also tipped "B" who carried our bags into the Mayan unit from the same folder. We had checked in between 5 and 6 p.m. and went to bed between 11 and midnight. The sliding doors and main door were locked (security lock). I placed my rings on the nightstand next to my bed and my purse on the floor next to my side of the bed. We fell asleep with the tv on in the background. As we slept, someone came into our bedroom, took my rings which were inches from where I lay and took my purse to the living room. They went through my purse, took some cash from my wallet and the over 50 $1.00 bills from the folder from which I had tipped various employees. (I had taken documents from the folder at the checkin counter and the $1.00 bills were noticeable as they were under a clear plastic. ) The robber did not touch my watch (an expensve sapphire watch by H Stern) which was a few inches from my rings but may have been hidden by a tissue; nor did he/they take my husband's watch, his wallet or money pouch, all of which were on his nightstand. Nor did they take our credit cards or passports. The next morning "M" who had checked us in denied having seen my rings and showed no surprise or emotion when told we had been robbed of money and jewelry worth over $20,000 while we slept. Security came and searched our unit and our personal belongings. The room manager expressed disbelief that I wore rings all the time as my fingers did not have white bands where the rings would have been. I had to remind him that unlike Cancun, Alaskans do not necessarily have sun tans around their jewelry fingers or wrists. My ring fingers had indentations where the rings rested. Only Veronica (an extremely professional security officer from Argentina and her associate, Max, both from security), showed real empathy for my loss and distress. They accompanied us to the police station where a report was made before we left for the airport. Nowhere in the report did they include the names of the persons I believed should be viewed as suspects. I had provided four names. Their explanation was that they would investigate. Veronica and Max are good people but work for a problem ridden hotel. They are undoubtedly required to protect the Mayan Palace's reputation. I don't have an explanation for their non-disclosure of the suspects names. They acted as translators of the report which was all in Spanish. I believe the theft was an inside job. I suspect that I was targetted as soon as I arrived and checked in. My rings which were unique were often commented upon throughout my travels (25 years) and I had worn them wthout problems all over the world, including in third world countries and other cities in Mexico and throughout South America. The Mayan was the calibre of hotel where fine jewelry would be worn. That was a major mistake. That this incident could have ended in our death is finally dawning on me. Whoever took our money and my rings had to have been prepared to deal with us in some violent manner had we awakened. It takes unusual brass for a thief to come into a bedroom to steal with people asleep in the room. I believe that the Mayan Palace is a dangerous place for tourists if they have anything of value. You are not secure in your condos. I noticed one of the reviewers to Trip Advisor (I read this site's reviews of the Mayan Palace before traveling there) stated that he found strange charges on his credit cards after a stay at the Cancun Mayan Palace. On my return home the same day we were robbed, I discovered a charge of $272 on my Visa card which I had not authorized. I paid my hotel bill of $17 in cash on checking out a little over 12 hours after we had checked in. I had read the reviews about the Mayan Palace before going to Cancun and thought I was safe at this hotel so long as I avoided time share presentations. I was deadly mistaken and realize we could have been killed or hurt badly had we awakened and tried to stop the thieves. It was a costly mistake which I hope all readers will not make themselves. I had a great deal of difficulty getting a phone number for the police and American Consolate from the hotel operator. She didn't want to give me the numbers and it took several tries and some threats to get the phone numbers. My advice is don't go near the Mayan Palace until they clean up all of their problems. The unauthorized charge on our VISA (I had authorized a hold of $100 for any extra's) shows that the problems of this hotel are pervasive from the top down. AF, AlaskaMy fiancée and I both love London. It’s versatility, it's thriving night-life, it's enormous shops, it's tranquil parks and much more... It must be Europe’s grandest city. For the final two night of our travel through all of the UK, eventually leading to London, we decided to stay in a somewhat more luxurious hotel than the previous hotel/motels we stayed in. We were exhausted and we needed a good place to rest, located somewhere from were could easily explore the city. Choosing for the Central Park Hotel (which is supposedly of 3 star quality) was one of the WORST decisions we made throughout our many travels. As we came in, there was a giant queue in front of us, we needed to wait for more than 30 minutes before being told that we couldn’t check in any time before three o’clock. After three o’clock, my fiancée and I went to visit the Hyde Park in the meanwhile, a chubby lady who seemed to be inseparably surrounded by a strikingly strong odour of sweat and being relentlessly sulky towards us, said she wasn’t yet capable to check us in for a twofold reason: there was no room available, there was no booking made (?!?). After I showed her my conformation and her inquiring at the reservation office, it took another 30 minutes for her to return, she admitted that it was simply not posted correctly in the system she worked from. So we where finally checked in. She said breakfast wasn’t included in the rate, but after I showed her my conformation again, she annoyingly admitted it was. We got four, clearly already used, vouchers. The roomed that was given to us was remarkably tiny, imagine a cramp single room with a king-size bed in there, that’s how it seemed. It was clearly smaller than the rooms of cheaper hotels we stayed in during our may travels. After noticing the dust on our in our windowsill and the stains in our bath we went down again to kindly ask for another room. The lady, still the same one and the only one apparently on service, who seemed annoyed while ending her Internet chat sessions to answer my request, simply said that there were no other rooms available. If we would come back in the morning, she said literally: “Maybe one of my colleagues the other morning wants to change it for you, check it with them.” I informed her, which is true and not just a lie that suits the situation, about my fiancée’s asthma, and that my fiancée couldn’t stay in a room as dirty as the one we were allocated in, she simply replied, “That’s your problem, sir.” The other morning though, after not-enjoying the cheap breakfast (only spongy croissant with some jam, no, jelly with a colour, we asked again, and still the receptionists weren’t able, some maybe not even capable, of changing our room. My fiancée didn’t sleep all night because of her condition, but I didn’t feel it was appropriate using this in the argument, until everything resulted in me speaking to an uncaring, uninterested, bad tempered front-office manager. Still nothing happened. My fiancée brought two towels from home. We were planning to sleep in hotels, but you never know for sure whatever your come across (like what happened in the CPH). After we asked for two new towels, the original ones had suspicious stains on them, we were presented with two greasy new ones. My fiancée therefore decided to use one of her own. In the morning, after coming back disappointed from asking (applying seems a better fit term) for a new room, we found that our towels had been removed by housekeeping that was already cleaning everything. After calling reception, where they put us through to concierge, where they asked us to call housekeeping, where I was put on hold before being put through to a lady, we were explained that the towels had already been taken downstairs by mistake. In the evening after seven, we noticed they weren’t delivered back, so I informed at the concierge desk. They didn’t know, they asked the duty manager, a kind gentleman from India, who would ask housekeeping again. The next morning even after check-out they didn’t find anything, they would just take another look which raised the suspicion the didn’t look at all. We left without them, leaving our address at the concierge desk, but nothing was sent home. It is not about losing the towels, we might have thrown them away in the end anyway, but it’s about the hotel fetching guest’s possessions and not even taking an effort to return them to there righteous owners! The hotel is horribly dirty and cheap for a ridiculous high rate. This, on itself, would not even be all to bad if it wasn’t for all staff being incredibly incapable and insolent (including management, especially the front-office manager) in there approach towards guests. DON’T GO THERE!!We were a group of two couples looking to enjoy a great week in the sun. We don't have a lot of high pressure demands or expectations. Just some hard working people looking to get a way from it all. Traveling to Blue Bay Grand Esmeralda was just fine, Funjet and Sun Country Airlines did a great job. We arrived late on Saturday Night. We were hungry and dry. It was too late for dinner so we got our room assignments and headed down the nearly half mile trail to our hotel room relatively near the beach. Our friends found their room in pretty good shape. We were not so lucky. Our room stunk badly of mildew. Like a cellar full of wet rags. pungent, gross. It was midnight, we were tired, so we moved in, hoping to fix things in the morning. We were awakened by the smell several times that night. Sunday morning I went to the Lobby, (walking down the nearly 1/2 mile yellow brick road) only to be turned down because they said they didn't have another room for us. I said give someone else that rotton room and give me a different one. That got me a dirty look and nothing else, So we went back to make the most of it, opened the patio door and blocked the hall door open. It helped a little but by then all our clothes had the same sweet smell which stayed with us till we got home. Our friend wouldn't even come in the room. On Monday, I convinced the house keeping to remove all the bedding, pillows down to the mattress and my wife scrubbed what mold she could get to from the wall and head board. And we ventilated it some more and left the bathroom exhaust fan on all week long. Every time we left for the day, room service would turn off the A/C and bathroom fan. We would gag when we opened the door on our return. So much for the horrible room. Our friend got diarhea on day 2 and pretty much kept it all week. I got it on Thursday and it was so bad I couldn't leave the room. Pretty much stayed with me until Saturday, so I was not too bad off on the flight home. We spent our entire time at the resort so they are to blame for our illness. Talked to several other people at the resort, people in their groups had gotton sick too. In general the food was average at best. Room service was slow and not good. Ordered a club sandwich to my sick room. They piled hot french fries on the sandwich and it was all a warm soupy mess when it arrived an hour later. Lots of people at the buffet left a lot of food on their plate which tells me most people didn't like what they had it. We went to the dinner show two nights, food was ok there except the waiters would get the orders wrong or forget a course. First night, the show was Maya historic dancers, Second night was, guess what, more Maya historic dancers. We didnt think we could take another night of warriors sacrificing virgins, so we tried other restaurants. Service at the Italian restaurant was soooo slow we left after an hour and half with no dessert. I missed steak night as I was still sick, my wife and friends said it was barely tolerable and buddy couldn't eat his all. We ate at the buffet a couple more times but had trouble finding dishes we wanted to put on our plate. The dishes weren't labeled very well and we couldn't figure out by appearance what it was. The staff appeared to be quite inexperienced and lacked a knowledge of the english language. I know I was in their country but I was the one who paid a lot of money for people to understand my basic needs. Entertainment - there really wasn't any worth mentioning, we are party people and were in bed by 10:00 most nights. Pool and beach - beautiful Ocean front - was really bad when we got there, looked like a cess pool. By the end of the week it was looking much better as they had a lot of people working on removing sea weed and garbage. It actually got good enough to walk in by week's end and I would have if I hadn't cut my toe on the pool bottom tile. First night we were there we got a pretty good buzz on drinking the tap beer (all that was available in beer). Beyond that we drank mixed drinks, cocktails and umbrella drinks all week, None of us ever felt any buzz. Concluded that the booze was watered down to nearly nothing. Seen one young group of 4 drinking tequilla shots. They were a litle typsy, but thats about it. The best meal we had all week was the hot turkey and cheese sandwich on the flight home. We have taken cruises the past 5 years, loved everyone of them, they had to tear my hands from the railing on the last day. This trip, we couldn't wait to get the hell out of there. If you want a dang good tan and lose 10 lbs and be bored this is the place to be. For our part, "If the world needed an enema, they would stick the hose in there". David and Glenda Mensch, Sioux Falls, South Dakota.The unattractive lighting made me want to gag, the food was overpriced, there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate.The web site fools you completely. I stayed at Hotel Pennsylvania from Wednesday, March 30, 2005 and checked out on Saturday, April 2, 2005. You may be wondering why did I stay so long if I considered it awful. Because I was with a group of 21 people from Michigan that prepaid for the trip. This hotel came "highly" recommended from the travel agency in Michigan which went through an agency in New York. Not only will I ever go through the travel agency again, but I will shout to the rooftops not to stay at this hotel. Yes, the location was a good one, but you could easily walk to different locations because the streets are not long at all, or you could quickly catch a subway, bus, or cab to where you want to go. As far as I'm concerned, Vornado Realty Trust (the hotel owner indicated on their website) and the managers have no integrity. I say this because it is no way that they would stay at a place with blood-like stains on the floor, sink, and shower curtain, mold in the shower, rust on the vents, stains on the lamp shade and telephone, carpet that causes you to never walk barefoot, stained walls, peeling wallpaper in the hallway, duct tape keeping the hallway carpet together (in plain site), and decrepit doors. Not only was the entire room decrepit, but the entire floor was decrepit. Mind you, I was with 21 other people. There were three of us in the room. If you risk going to the Hotel Pennsylvania, view the rooms or floors first. They actually have crappy floors, meaning that all the rooms are similar by the floor. I was on the 3rd floor. My last day, after hearing that one of the people in my group went and complained for the 2nd time and insisted that the manager walk up with her to view the room that they placed her in after her first complaint, she finally received a decent room after initially being placed in a room that looked as if yellow crime scene tape should be placed around it (that is how she described it), we decided to take a look at her final room. It was very small, but cute. She had a bathtub and shower with minimal mold (I feel all hotels should pull out tile in the bathroom if they are not going to take the time to clean it properly). She had a cherry oak headboard and small entertainment center that held her television. She also had a clock/radio and refrigerator. It took her to complain two times in order to get a decent room. This room was located on the 6th floor. We were on the 3rd floor and had none of these things. And don't think it got better the higher you went because the 18th floor seemed crappy too. We walked around on a few floors as housekeeping was cleaning the rooms. Now the person that gave this hotel a decent review because they've stayed in crappier hotels, I feel sorry for him/her. But I have traveled on business for years and this was supposed to be a leisure trip so I'm assuming my expectations are either much higher or his/her expectations are lower because of the experiences. And since I travel so much, I will make sure that my previous employer and current employer know to stay away from this hotel. Yes, they have nice rooms, but Vornado Realty Trust should not be trusted. After returning home, I noticed that their website does not describe the amenities in the Standard rooms. This seems to be the "type" of room that we had. On the site, the pillows on the bed are covering up the fact that you do not have a headboard and that the walls are stained. You also do not see the bathroom for these "standard" rooms. And the lighting is not an accurate account on the website compared to what was our reality. Stay away, stay away, stay away. And if you have invested in Vornado Realty Trust, you are investing with a company that has no integrity. On the home (main) page of their site, in the second paragraph, they state "Inside of New York's Hotel Pennsylvania, you'll find beautifully renovated rooms, with new furniture and carpeting, a work desk with reading lamp, large color televisions, AM/FM clock radios, telephones with voice mail, individual AC and climate control are only featured in select New York City hotels." We should have assumed "compared to what." Well, we found out it that it was compared to the crappy rooms that they have. Read between the lines. You will find these renovated rooms, but you may not get one. This is an integrity issue displayed on their website. On the Accommodations page, it states in the second paragraph "The comfort and security of our guests are always important to us." Maybe the security because they have a security guard by the elevators, but definitely not the comfort. We were guests and our comfort did not seem to be important because they would not have placed us in a room like that. Again, proving their lack of integrity. I was not comfortable enough to step in the shower barefoot, therefore I constantly called housekeeping to bring extra towels, lay them in the shower and on the bathroom floor in order to avoid contact with any surface. And if I did, I would rewash that spot that touched the surface. Does that seem comfortable? We were so uncomfortable that we avoided the room as much as possible. The only good thing I have to say about the staff is that the man that brought me extra towels each morning seemed nice and the lady in housekeeping that I called to request for the towels would say "right away mam." Also, the people at the information desk seemed nice and helpful. We would sit in the lobby if we knew we were not going right up to bed. And now that I think about it, maybe I can assume that most of the people that sat in the lobby had rooms on at least the 3rd and 18th floor (the crappy floors that we saw). We were not comfortable at all. This is still fresh in my mind and although my description may seem over-the-top, we were the ones that stayed there.Hi! We just got back from our vacation 7-16 to 7-23 at the Mayan Palace-Riveria Mayan and what a nightmare it was!!! First off we called prior to our arrival to see if the hotel/resort was well prepared for the arrival of Hurricane Emily and we were assured they were highly trained and prepared. Off we went like trusting fools to the airport. On our arrival we were told that they hadn't had a Hurricane hit since 1988, (how I ask you can employees under the age 30 be prepared for something they have never experienced?) We were taken to our suite that we purchased the previous year on our vacation to Playa del Carmen. Turns out it didn't sleep 10 as told and shown to us in their presentation. Luckily there were only three of us, my husband, my father & myself. We were told no problem, the sofa converts to a sleeper. Turns out the conversion was a drawer that rolls out from the bottom of the couch with a thin mattress. Poor dad had to sleep in what we called "the drawer". I was never so embarrassed! He tried the couch too, but it was harder than the bed in the next room. We arrived on Sat. & my hubby & dad we eager to hit their awesome golf course. They were told "NO" it is being closed down for the arrival of the hurricane. I'm no Tiger Woods, but what does it take to pull out the flags? Maybe a half hour?? So no golf was allowed that day! Off we went to check out the pool, which is huge and awesome, despite the fact it is only 3-1/2 feet deep or less all over???? The following day was Sun. and we didn't see much hurrying & scurrying being done for a category 5 hurricane due to hit in less than 24hrs. We ate breakfast, pricey but a good buffet and headed to the pool, we were ran out of there by noon, it had to be closed for the coming hurricane too! Back in our room the phone rang at 2:00 pm. informing us to pack a small bag with a change of clothes and to bring our pillows down to the lobby so we could be bused to the cyclone shelter. We were taken to a building (still on the same resort property) that was closer to the water than our hotel room was and they were packing (some 1500 plus people) into a building that was approved at 11:00am that day by the Mexican govt. to be called a cyclone shelter. Up the stairs we went like sardines to find a building that appeared to be a warehouse of some kind with many seperate rooms, no air conditioning and only a couple of fans. We were then placed in folding chairs with our knees touching a wall and told this would be our seats for the next 12 hrs. or more. NO WAY!!! You couldn't even get out of your row to use the restroom! We refused when we were told there was one exit and that it would be sealed and boarded shut once everyone was inside. Felt like a huge coffin to us! Off we went on foot back to our room where we made it as hurricane proof as possible by doing some fancy rearranging of furniture. Two other families followed suit with our idea! We then spent the night in the bathroom (the safest place to be) and at least we could use the potty and stretch out to get some sleep! Emily came through Mexico with a good fight but we won and I am happy to say the room withstood the high winds and flying debris from construction and breaking trees! What an experience! The next morning (Mon.) people were coming back to their rooms at daylight after being encrypted for some 14+ hrs. The resort lost power during the storm which meant all restaurants in the resort were closed. They opened a buffet for everyone in a half constructed building and then proceeded to try to charge $13.00 USD per person for a buffet of literally scrambled eggs, refried beans, yogurt, fresh fruit, coffee, milk & juice. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!! Needless to say we refused to pay for the only thing they could offer! (Well prepared my foot!) Although we had a rental car and there are taxis that only cost you an arm & leg, we were not allowed to leave the resort due to roads being closed from debris on them. We were told by a manager that if we didn't like it to go to Cancun and eat! WE DID!!! They had us where they wanted us and jacked the prices up! THE NERVE! Power was not restored until 3 days later at 10:30pm. During this time we had running water to shower but only lights in the hallways and a one watt bulb above the table! We were offered no candles or flashlights or anything for the rooms. Luckily we brought our own candles (just in case) so that we could see to use the restroom & shower! There was one ice machine for three floors in our building that of course could not make ice fast enough to accomodate everyone. No power meant no air conditioning which meant sleeping with the sliding glass doors of the balcony open and sweating to death. I awoke on Tues. morning to some 30+ mosquito bites and I looked like I had the chicken pox. Another guest that had the pox too, told me they would come up to spray our room for us, the resort failed to mention this service and neccessity. Oh, and did I mention that for a cup of coffee they wanted $3.00. PLEASE! Even Motel 6 gives you complimentary coffee! There was absolutely nothing to do at the resort at this point, the pool was closed due to half the so called beach being in it and no electric for filtration. The golf course was not opened for guests until Thurs. as we were repeatedly told it was too dangerous to play on! Then they had the audacity to charge you full price to play on it! Thank goodness Playa del Carmen got their s__t together quickly so we could eat and half way enjoy ourselves during the rest of our stay! At check out when we demanded some kind of reimburesment for their inconvenience, we were offered a FREE week at some other time during the next year for the low cost of $495.00 maintenance fee!!!! HOW IS THAT FREE???? Overall this resort is the pits, the staff was rude, not willing to accomodate in an emergency and in general very poorly managed!!!! The food and immenities are grossly over priced, you walk till you get a side ache to get to anything in the resort, the furnishings are low grade and uncomfortable and the walls are paper thin to sound (we know we must of had bored honeymooners next to us...or perhaps they were moaning from all those mosquito bites...who knows?) We definately regret buying a timeshare at this out of the way inconvenient resort...hurricane or not! Anyone interested in purchasing our red week cheap let me know, we won't be using them at the Riveria Mayan that's for certain! TWO THUMBS DOWN & ONE FINGER UP! Stay at Playa you won't regret it!!!Was this a nightmare? I have never stayed in such a terrible place in my life. Our group of 19 selected this hotel for us to meet before leaving on a cruise. While we realize that Days Inn鈥檚 are privately owned, we believe Days Inn should be ashamed to have their well known and respected name associated with this hotel. We chose the facility because of location, price and shuttle service. We didn't realize it was the Hotel California or the next thing to hell. Days Inn ended up sending us one $50.00 gift certificate for our inconvenience. This is just another nail in the coffin. As we all continue to travel we find oursleves shying away from any Days Inn. At the airport we proceeded to the courtesy phones to call for a shuttle. This hotel was not included in the listing so I called using a cell phone. This should have been clue # 1. It was roughly 2:30 PM. I was told the shuttle was on its way. We went outside to wait only to join another party that had already been waiting an hour. They were told check-in wasn鈥檛 until 3 PM anyway. When the shuttle did show up the other party had been waiting 1.5 hours so we let them go first. We were told another shuttle would arrive in about 5 minutes since there were two running. Another 45 minutes passed and the same, loud mouthed driver returned. By the time we got to board a shuttle it had been 1.5 to 2 hours. The female driver was on her cell phone talking loudly in Spanish all the way to the hotel. On arrival, check-in seemed normal. Four of us proceeded to our pre-booked room of 2 double beds on the third floor. When we got to the window we could see it was one king size bed. We went back down to let them know there was a mistake. The young clerk (a female who had no customer service skills) said our group did not have any rooms with 2 double beds booked and there were no vacancies left. After some discussion she bumped someone else and gave us another room on the 5th floor. By that point the elevator was out of order and everyone had to lug their luggage up multiple flights of stairs. As some of our other parties arrived and checked in we compared rooms. Two of them had rooms with 2 double beds, exactly what we had requested when booking early in 2005. I went back to the front desk to let them know that the rooms were booked correctly, and that the incorrect parties were assigned the room. It would just be a matter of switching. I was told that everything was our or the travel agents fault and they were not allowed to let guest switch rooms. Frustrated and searching for a solution I asked if they had roll away beds since one room had 3 people. They said yes and I figured the problem was solved. Then they let me know it would be an additional $10.00 charge. Again the blame was placed on us and they were not responsible. When I returned to the lobby to greet family members from around the country, instead of happy greetings we were instead greeted with more like 鈥渨hat in the world is going on here?鈥?One of our couples related their room number with another couple of our group. They had both been assigned the same room on different credit cards and again they returned for more poor service. During all of this time other guest were coming in and facing poor service, requesting refunds, and others who had confirmations did not even get a room. The staff did not show any empathy and simply could not care. They only spoke to each other in Spanish making guest feel even more inferior. Even an extremely reeking bum came in the lobby begging for money. We went to the desk early the next morning for towels since there were only two towels for four people. They said they would send some right up. After an hour, they never arrived. I ended up without a shower to start my day. When it was time to go to the cruise ship, they only ran one shuttle because it was Sunday, the busiest day of the week for them since cruise ships arrive and depart that day. We chose to hire taxis at our own expense to make sure we arrived on time. Most others waiting since early morning did the same. The same shuttle driver as the one who picked us up the day before walked around like she had all day. You would think she would have been moving guest as fast as possible to get more tips. Again, she simply did not care.Online description 鈥?Miami Days Inn Civic Center is a three star hotel. It has complimentary shuttle service to the Airport, Port of Miami, Downtown Bayside Shopping.

We have yet to figure out what the role of the outside security guard. He arrived in the morning with his boom box and sat in the outside security booth. With the traffic and congestion of taxi鈥檚, shuttles and busses, he never moved from the building to assist with the safety of the guest.The only positive thing I can say about this place is its location, right on Euston Square station and a short walk to Warren St or Euston.... though Euston Square is not the most useful in terms of links to other central tourist spots and involves a change to most common destinations, it's handy to be so close to the system (mind you, when selecting the hotel we thought we were arriving via Euston mainline, which would've been very convenient, but the high rails costs forced a change of plan to arriving by coach at Victoria, which resulted in losing a lot of time on our last day getting our case to left luggage in Victoria before sightseeing). To the hotel itself; it describes itself online as being recently refurbished in a very chic and modern design and the picture suggested a decent sized room with trendy decor. This, to me, was gross misrepresentation! Reception was decently decorated, though the rather cheap, shabby look of the entrance let it down. Despite giving credit card details to secure the booking and being informed that payment would be taken at the END of the stay, they made us pay on arrival. This is not the system I expect at British hotels and implies an atmosphere of mistrust (despite the fact that they have your card details already, so you couldn't "do a runner"). I suspect they want to take payment before you see your room! One of the first things you notice in all the common hallways and in the rooms is the same, light coloured and very badly stained carpet throughout. When reburbishing, surely this should've been one of the first things to address.... at least a dark carpet wouldn't have shown up the dirt! The room was tiny. One bedside cabinet, with a wardrobe on the other side of the bed. Cheap-looking melamine furniture throughout the room. No bedside lights, Windows that only opened 1-2cm at the top, which made it very stuffy and hot (and not on a particularly hot July weekend). The window blinds were so bad they were comical, when pulled, the cord and holder came off the window and nearly hit us in the face. Closer inspection showed that it should be held on with a sticky pad and operated the blinds with magnets... of course in such a high-use environment these pads had failed... so you had to stand on the furniture and hold it in place to adjust the blinds (what our position would've been if we'd fallen off and injured ourelves while doing this, I'm not sure). The TV only had 3 terrestrial channels and 1 or 2 freeview ones tuned in, and no indication anywhere of what , if any, charges were for other channels or internet. The TV screen bracket could not be adjusted horizontally, and was loose so the vertical position was fixed at a downward angle, so the screen faced towards the floor to the side of the bed. The complimentary drinks tray was finally located in the cupboard under the TV because there was no surface space for it. There was no plug socket anywhere near a surface, so the kettle had to be boiled on the floor by the bed. The tea tray only provided 2 standard coffee sachets (but as a lactose intolerant who doesn't like black coffee, I couldn't drink this as there was only UHT milk). My partner is diabetic, and no sweeteners were provided, which might've been a nice extra touch given the numbers of diabetics and dieters there are. The bathroom was very cramped and the sliding door left a gap when closed, to a maximum of 2 inches at the bottom... which is a little offputting, even with just a partner in the room... the layout meant that, through this gap, you could see a reflection of someone on the loo! so a certain amount of discretion was in order! The shower was extremely cramped, and the hotel boasted extensive complimentary items included. With the shower being too small to avoid getting hair wet, a shower cap might've seemed a reasonable addition, but again, they were overselling what was actually a very basic service. What was included were: Shower Gel, watered down shampoo, hand soap and face & body lotion. I can only assume that the addition of the latter is what makes them feel they can market themselves as offering more than the minimum, but the lotion smelled old and slightly off. Also, all of these were provided in bottles attached to the wall, presumably this is because it costs a little more to provide the single-use bottles you expect to find in hotels, and to prevent people pocketing anything they didn't use, as you could do with small bottles/packets..... the whole thing left you feeling that anything they provided was done so grudgingly and they were determined not to provide you with anything more than the absolute minimum. Though we didn't have any street noise from our side of the building as others have experienced, we did find that the soundproofing was awful, and you could hear footsteps, voices and doors slamming all the time. Breakfast was OK, for what it was... Continental: croissants (plain or chocolate), cereals, fresh fruit salad (quite nice) fresh juice and toast you had to make yourself with jams, honey, marmalade, cheese & ham. Coffee was fresh brewed in thermos jugs but not piping hot. To be honest, I don't really like continental breakfasts, as a non-milk drinker I'm very restricted anyway. In a UK hotel, I want a full english breakfast. On our 2nd morning we forgot my partner's sweeteners so I asked if they had any and we were given some... it was great that they had them, but not impressed that they weren't put out. One other personal issue which did not endear the place to me was that it chose to be a completely no-smoking hotel. Legally, hotel bedrooms can permit smoking. If the hotel had been as nice as marketed, I might've accepted this as a rule to maintain the pleasant decor and furnishings, but as it was very hostel-like and the carpets in such an appalling state, I struggled to understand their decision not to have a few smoking rooms (I'm fully appreciative that many guests might not want to follow a smoker into a room, and so I am quite happy to accept that a place may have just a few reserved for smokers and the rest smoke-free). To add insult to injury, I dutifully observed the smoking ban, and then we got a call after coming out of the shower to tell us our smoke alarm had been triggered (no sign of this in our room, we can only assume that it was set off by the steam in the very cramped space)... I got the distinct impression there was a suspicion, and veiled accusation, that we had been smoking in there!April 2006 Member , Calgary, Alberta Just got back from Las Vegas. Booked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel after checking it out on the tripadvisor. Although it was rated to be above average hotel, we found that it was poorly managed and very inefficient in PR and poor co-ordination between management and guest. The check-in was a wash. There was no proper lines formed to ensure proper service to guest as the queue just form at each counter instead of a single queue that would ensure first come first serve. Registered guest could not ask a simple question (eg. where is the elevator?) without queuing behind a long line of new registering guest. Poor information on whereabouts of main locations i.e. elevators to the floors. Simple task like putting a floor plan at the registration area would help especially for 1st time guest. Poor layout of casino area that forces everyone to venture anywhere to pass through the smoke screen before they get anywhere. Children and non-smokers do not appreciate having second hand smoke! Poor coordination of information i.e. the pool times even among staff was not properly conveyed and limited pool usage time from 9.00a.m. to 6.00p.m. only. The wave pool is a joke with one wave every 5 minutes!! The rental of tube is $20.00. The gym is $30 per day use. I thought a 4 star hotel provide basis gym facilities!! Food is expensive despite being a casino. Guest were complaining to the staff and the staff did expressed their sympathy but could not help much except to direct the guest directly to the senior management which we did voice out our opinion. I do sympathize with the staff having to put up with the constant complains from the guest and also the second hand smoke that they have to endure all day and night. We requested a non-smoking room but was given a smoke filled room. The staff managed to change it for us. Although the rooms were large but unfortunately not very clean compared to smaller hotels. The elevators corridor was a zoo with all 3 wings converging in a central location serving 2 thousand rooms and guest trying to move their baggage up and down and guest trying to ride the elevators. We took the elevator up while going down to fight the rush to get into one. A couple of guest realise that it was faster to ride up and come down than wait for an elevator to go down. There are 3 hotels inside the Mandalay Bay hotel and this is very confusing to the 1st time guest especially for parking and getting around. A floor plan was handed out at check-in but the prints were tiny to know where to go. So it comes back to asking the front desk which involves waiting in line. We had a lunch and a dinner inside the hotel and found the prices more expensive than necessary considering that we could have better value elsewhere. We booked for 5 nights but checked out after 2 nights and headed for Palm Springs instead of enduring another 3 nights at a much higher room rate. One other guest in line also decided to check out despite having good reviews in her previous stays because she had to wait 45 minutes to get a simple answer from the front desk as people were cutting into her queue without realizing that she was waiting. Despite the huge income generated from the casino, I know that the hotel need to depend on continued satisfied guest that consider Las Vegas as a destination area and also a good value vacation spot. If it was just for the gambling, any casino without facility would do for gamblers. But if the Las Vegas hotels are to survive in the distant future, it should start to seriously consider the huge customer base that do not smoke and not necessary gamble big but spend considerable amount i.e. Disneyland, Universal Studios, Knotts Berry farm, even New York City etc. It is the consistent and larger group of people that are prepared to spend and enjoy what they value i.e. good food, fun and entertainment. After all the over-rated reviews of Las Vegas, my wife and daughter have decide never to go back as it was not a good experience for the money's worth. As for myself, I see the failings of these mega hotels in placing too much emphasis on being big and extravagant but forgetting that it is the efficiency, friendliness, thoughfulness, cleanliness, basis amenities, good value and enjoyable stay that makes a hotel. To proof my point, I know that hotels in New York City are very much smaller and rooms are tiny in comparison yet they are more appealing and yet more expensive in most of them. New York City may not have the gambling and vice appeal but it is still much more fun than Las Vegas with all the glitter and shine. For families planning to visit Las Vegas for family fun time, go any where else with a decent wave pool than Mandalay Bay.Do not book or stay at the Peninsula Excelsior the service is terrible Firstly they are currently renovating rooms so if you are booked in here you will hear jack hammers from 9.30am to 6.30pm. It appeared to us that the work was happening on the 10th floor but we could easily hear it on the 15th floor we were on. We booked a triple room months in advance and arrived at the hotel at 4.00pm, well after the check in time of 2.00pm, to be told that our room was not available yet and we should go shopping for awhile. I had not advised them what time we would be checking in so the room should have been ready from 2.00pm. I told the girl behind the desk that I was travelling with my elderly mother (78 years) and we had been travelling all day between airports since 8.00am that morning and that she was very tired and needed to rest so please hurry with the room. We were given 1 free non alcoholic drink voucher for the lobby bar which was a small glass of weak fruit juice or could have even been cordial. I was told that they would come and get us from the lobby when the room was ready. We noticed other people waiting in the lobby with the same drink. After an hour I approached the desk again to be told no the room is still not ready. I voiced my complaint yet again but was told to please wait. After another half an hour, it is now 5.30pm and we have waited an hour and a half in the lobby I return to the desk and finally the room is ready but no one came and got us. We go up the lift and although I booked a non-smoking room as soon as the lift doors open we are overwhelmed with cigarette smoke. We push on and open the door of our room to find that it was a room reeking of cigarette smoke and it has a double bed in it even though I booked a twin room with an extra single bed. We did a quick U turn and returned to the reception desk to be told we are booked out but we will bring in another bed and ‘refresh the room to remove the smoke smell’. Any of you who do not smoke know it is impossible to remove the smoke smell from a room that is heavily used as a smoking room. I argued that my mother has Asthma and there is no way she can stay in that room but I continued to get “we are fully booked”. If I had not paid for the room in advance I would have walked out long ago so gave up on this girl and asked for the Manager. He finally arrived and after a long discussion with him he finally found us another room which was smaller in size but on a non-smoking floor. No compensation was offered to us for this like a free lunch/dinner or even a free alcoholic drink or even a room upgrade. So after waiting an hour and a half for this room we get there to find: • Twin beds – great but they have been pushed together so have to call Housekeeping to get them separated and the bedside tables rearranged. • Another bed has to be delivered – that takes another 45 mins • The electronic key tag that you place the card in does not work so no electricity in the room – that takes an hour to fix as the reader is faulty not the cards • The room safe does not work, batteries are dead – that takes an hour for new batteries to be delivered and installed. We finally got out of our room after all the repairs and problems at 7.45pm to go for dinner. When we go to check out I am told that I have to pay for the internet I have used in my room. I argue that nowhere does it say in the room or in the room manual that there is a cost for the internet so I am not paying. They certainly were not going to get any more money out of me. Next to me at the desk are 2 guys arguing that they booked a twin room and have been given a double bed. I hear the usual “We are fully booked” so I lean over and tell them we have just booked out of our room which is a twin so that is available to them. On passing through the lobby on other days we notice many people sitting with their bags and the free drink and this is late in the day. It appears that this hotel is well under staffed in cleaning staff and make guests wait for their rooms. The annoyance is that they will not tell you how long you have to wait and at the price you pay for this hotel the service needs to be much better. We also stayed at the Pan Pacific Singapore which I could not fault on anything so my advice is give the Peninsula Excelsior a big miss and go to the Pan Pacific. It is a shame that this hotel’s service is so bad as the views from our room were fantastic and even the room was OK but I would not put up with this bad service again. I don’t go away on a holiday to be sitting in a lobby waiting for a room at the end of the day and having to fight for what I have booked and paid for.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.I asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter.The plan was a romantic getaway with my girlfriend to Quebec City and Montreal. It was all going to plan until we arrived at our hotel Champ De Mar (a term which should be used extremely loosely when describing it) in Montreal. I searched online and via the Montreal Tourism website and wanted to stay in or near Old Montreal. After reading several hotel descriptions, The Champ De Mar Hotel caught my attention, describing itself with a European atmosphere and having been renovated a few years ago, seemed to be ideal. The hotel online photos seemed to support their description. I've attached photo's as they'll save many thousands words. Our stay went from bad to worse to worst to absolutely terrible. The 2 1/2 star rating not-with-standing, I don't know or understand how this hotel is rated as such, because it is not a hotel and more a hostel. I've stayed in motels with that were much friendlier, cleaner and spacious. The online hotel description is grossly overstated and absolutely misleading and the photo's are certainly well positioned to hide the true nature of this place. Don't be fooled. Location: ** Your not centrally located within Old Montreal, in fact the hotel is on the absolute eastern outskirts of the Old Port and certainly not part of the Old Montreal scene and atmosphere. Reception and Service: ** Front desk closes at 11pm. I checked in after 10pm and the front doors were locked, having to wait for the attendant to finally see me and open the door to let me in. ** Once I began the check in process, the attendant advised me that I had to pay for my two day stay in advance with no refund. I discovered the "why" within minutes. I found the staff stereotypically French and very indifferent considering we're visitors to the city. Fortunately, our service experience outside the hotel was very very different. Parking: ** There is no parking at the hotel. You must park your car almost two blocks away in a public parking at $15.00 per day and more should you used your car during you stay in Montreal. The walk to the hotel at night is uncomfortable because the street is poorly lit and not part of the well populated tourist area of Old Montreal. Ladies beware. No Elevator: ** Should you decided to experience for yourself this hotel, pick a lower floor which to stay. To get to your room you need to use a dark and smelly stairwell that will barely fits yourself with your luggage. And should you encounter someone coming in the opposite direction, there's not enough room someone must back up. Cleanliness: ** Generally, it should be much much better. Read on. Bathroom: ** See attached photos. It's small with the basic 3 pieces. We used the plastic cups because they were individually wrapped, otherwise we were very careful to touch as little as possible. Our Room: ** See attached photos. Small is the only adjective I'll use. We had a double bed and only space enough to walk down one side. ** Do not expect to get a good night sleep. The mattress and pillows are the poorest quality and the furniture are not antiques, rather someone else garbage. The room is small with sealed windows and therefore no air circulation and extremely stuffy and smelly of body odor. ** There is no-where to hang up your clothes and never the less decided to keep all our clothes in our suitcases.... explanation to come, read on. ** The walls are paper thin and you can hear EVERYTHING, especially if you're lucky to find yourself near the stairwell. We were fortunate (not) to be booked beside a room that had same children and it seemed we were all in the same room. ** The now for the best, if your able to get through all the above, that is, cramped quarters, poor mattress and pillows, stuffy and smelly enclosed room and able to close your eyes and fall asleep (more from exhaustion) then in the morning you'll find dozens of BED BUG BITE welts all over your body. Although my girlfriend and I wore our clothing to bed, not sleepware, our cloths, my girlfriend had dozens of bites over her arms, feet and torso where her sweater rode up in bed, including six on her face. Now ladies and gentlemen, how romantic do you think she felt?? Again, stay away from this place. Breakfast: ** Our stay included breakfast which is the only minutely good thing I can write about, with you choice of bacon and eggs, french toast and pancakes (Aunt Jemina). ** If you expecting Bistro and epicurean cuisine as described in there brochure, then if my aunt had wheels she'd be a wagon. Many many many better places to have breakfast with much more atmosphere. Renovations: ** Just looking at the quality of the materials and workmanship; I would guess the material probably came from demolition sites and the workmanship came from summer teenage students with no painting, ceramic or construction knowlegde and the furniture and mattresses from garage sales. Our Escape for Peace of Mind: ** For our second night we stayed at the Delta for about $20.00 less than I had already paid for at the Champ De Mar. I suggest anyone who is reading this review (and the others attached) do the same. The Champ De Mar Hotel is better and should more accurately be described as the "Night De Mare Hotel". And should you decided to ignore not only my experience but the rest of the reviews on Trip Advisor, then best wishes and after your experience is over..... we all tried to warn you and we told you so. Besides, if you want to experience this type of adventure, then I suggest camping, you'll have more room in a tent, plenty of fresh air and you'll be prepared for bug bites with deet. ***** The Bad ***** Finding "Hotel Night De Mare" ***** The Worse ***** Staying at "Hotel Night De Mare ***** The Worst ***** You actually pay premium dollars for your stay at the Hotel Night De Mare. ***** The Terrible ***** The time you'll have, if you planned a romantic getaway with that special and significant other in your life and expect any sort of "amore ce soir" in the "Hotel Night De Mare". It will not happen ladies or gentlemen!! ***** The Stupid ***** It's me, for not having consulted Trip Advisor prior to booking the "Hotel Night De Mare". Having now read the past "victims" reviews would have saved much grief in so many ways. My girlfriend still has the welts from the bed bug bites to remind me of our romantic getaway at the "Hotel Night De Mare". Now, you've all now been advised and duly warned. Save yourselves and stay away from this place, better and certainly more accurately known as "The Night De Mare Hotel".What can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree, then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back (which she did politely, by the way).After arriving in Seattle at then end of a drive across the state, I called the hotel around 1400 to check to see if early check in would be possible. If not, we would just drive down to the waterfront and do through the aquarium. We were told by the hotel employee that she could not answer that over the phone, we need to go in to find out the answer. I realize that the answer to this question has several different variables: room availability, company policy, etc. However, we had traveled across the state with two kids and were just asking if it would be possible. I would have been happy to check in later. Once we arrived, we were checked in by the same individual that we had just spoken with. We were behind another couple that was checking in and I overheard the employee provide instructions to the couple ahead of us. After checking in, we were told that there was a daily parking charge of $15, which while somewhat reasonable, was not advertised at the time of the reservation. The unnamed employee (no nametag visible) then offered assistance to the next people in line to check in. At which point, I asked where the parking was. I received a blank look in return. After getting that it was below the building, I went to park my car. Now, I must comment that the parking garage leaves a LOT to be desired. The two handicapped spots that are next to the elevator are only marked for compact vehicles. I do not drive a compact vehicle. I can accept existing parking garage design restrictions prevent ideal parking spaces. I can also acknowledge that while they might meet the letter of the law for American with Disabilities Act, it does not make it convenient in any way. I was able to locate a parking spot further away from the elevator. But that presented a problem in itself. When my wife tried to bring the luggage cart to the car, she couldn’t. The parking structure had a height restriction of 6 foot. The cart was taller than 6 foot. I was able to tilt the cart over and drag it through this height restricted area because it was empty. But, once loaded with our luggage, I could no longer perform this feat. I will point out that you can go around the parking garage to the other side where the height restriction allows the cart to pass through loaded. However, as previously mentioned, I am handicapped and walking any distance is rather difficult. Walking into my room was like hitting a wall of cheap cologne. I don’t know if the smell was supposed to cover up a more foul stench, or if it was from the previous occupant. Either way, it was rather unpleasant, if not survivable. I proceeded to sit in the nice comfy chair only to find out that all the comfy qualities of said chair were worn out. The arms of the char were not nicely padded, instead the wood frame wound up digging into my arms. Sense I was on my long awaited vacation, I figured that I would make the best of things. I then took off my shoes and socks, I like walking around barefoot on carpet. It’s a small guilty pleasure after having my foot in and out of casts for four years. I walked across the room to splash some water on my face only to find that my feet stuck to the carpet with every step. I put my socks back on. Jump ahead to my shower experience. I will acknowledge that your hotel has “Gone Green,” and while the shower head might be eco friendly, it is not person friendly. A high pressure, low volume nozzle is more fitting in a C&C environment, not in a shower. I found that the extra time spent trying to rinse off countered any water saving qualities that the shower head offers. The Elevators are smooth if not very slow. I am sure that this is a constant complaint, but let me address this. While waiting for the elevators, after several minutes, I began to look around for the stairs. I saw on the wall next to the elevators a sign indicating in case of a fire, use the stairs. Great sign, really useful to those that are unaccustomed to elevators, however, I saw no signs as to where these stairs were. Now, up until now I have talked about comfort features. This is a real safety issue. On day two, I was talking to another hotel patron about the long wait for the elevator. He mentioned to me that there are stairs at both ends of the hall, but they do not go down to the lobby. The stairs apparently only lead to the outside. For being an eco friendly hotel, not providing the option for stairs instead of the elevator seems a little short sighted. I know that this addresses a structure issue and not one easily overcome without major building modifications. I can say that the room had a very nice view of the Space Needle and was conveniently located next to the EMP, Space Needle, and the Pacific Science Center. But the hotel description fails to mention the fire station that must reside next to it. Between the sirens going off all night and the people running screaming down the hall, I found it really rather difficult to get any sleep. I will take the blame for not reporting the screamer to the front desk. By that time, I had pretty well given up on sleep and found it a distraction from the sirens. The four days and three nights that we spent in this hotel sounds more like a comedy of errors that the tragic experience that it was. When I spend my vacation time and my money on a hotel room, I expect far more that what I received. That being said, the experience was not a complete waste. After having spent my vacation in this hotel, I have absolutely no desire to stay in any other Best Western hotel again. If asked by family, friends or coworkers, I would not recommend this hotel.I am going to try and not make this a very long review but boy I just got back last night and had to write a review.. first I always research my resorts and read as many review with this web site and the forums ect. before going anywhere and I don't know what went wrong but this resort was the pitts!!! The lobby is very small and is only a little lobby ( no bar ect..) you have to go down the hill and into a basement or underground garage type structure to get to the sports bar/ theater .. No air conditioning and HOT HOT HOT no air circulation. The rooms where ok . nothing really bad to say except very musty.. I always bring candles but it didn't help much. We stayed in bld. 5 .. the floors where very noisy I guess the way they were laid out the doors seem to slam shut on there own and you could hear everything going on in the halls thru the door. They picked up room service trays outside of peoples doors at like 5 am and woke me every morning.. The pool is very shallow it is less then 4 ft deep everywhere. no deep end at all. The pool and pool area was nothing grand very old looking with cracks and tiles missing. The beach was really un swimable we tried, you have to walk forever and still only have water to your thighs.. It was muddy on the bottom as well. They have one restarurant open for breakfast and lunch which is right by the pool and the beach. It had big glass windows but no air and it was HOT in there.. Also they are very strict no bathing suit tops at all.. Which kinda ticked me off. I have a nice wrap to wear around my waist and shoes ect. and they made me go back to the room for a shirt. Nothing like relaxing and eating at the beach restaurant in your suit??The people overall where not nice at this hotel. They had a bar next to the beach restaurant which was just a counter to order and take your drinks back to your chair kinda thing, and a swing bar at the other end of the pool. The swing bar was very small and only had maybe 15 swings. it was always busy and the one guy that they had to waiter drinks for the pool made his drink order there so it seemed the bartender was always busy making his twenty at one time drink order. This was the only bar thu that had a nice breeze because it was on the beach... The only other bar was between the two restaurant up by the sports bar... No ac there either and HOT.. It was a shame you get dressed for dinner and there is no place to go to relax and have a drink without sweating to death.. They had two reservation only restaurants to choice from each evening.. they would rotate say one night you choice either french or seafood one night the next steakhouse or mexican ect. they have the one big restaurant open for buffet dinner only. Making reservations is a nightmare... No one will get a dinner reservation on there first night. Its there rule.. The food for breakfast and lunch where bad. I am not a picky person but I was not happy and my husband whos big idea of a grand meal is a hot dog was not impressed as well. The main buffet for dinner was ok . nothing great.. no carving stations ect. they had a pasta guy the one night to cook pasta but it wasn't good. The reservation dinners where just ok as well. The seafood we got in our last night and had there surf and turf which was fancy but cold and lobster not much taste.. It sounds like I am being prissy but I am the most down to earth person For me to complain this much is alot for me but I really don't want anyone to make the same mistake as I did by choosing this resort. No place to dance or do anything really at this place. When we checked in the guy tried to tell me we had to pay 3 dollars a night for insurance ?? I was like I have trip insurance I don't need your insurance and he was very upset that I didn't want there protection. he made me sign a waiver form to decline there insurance. After check in he told me to go talk to the conciege sp? to make my dinner reservations. Which turned out to be a time share guy!! I was like I am not interested and we are only staying for a couple of nights ect.. major pressure from this guy. we told him we were here on a quick honeymoon ( which we were ).. He told me he would make an exception and make dinner reservations for us that night and the next also.. he was not sure about our last night.. to check with him the next day. He also said he would take care of the the the champage , flowers and choc. strawberries that was promised for our honeymoon. well nothing in our room and that night showed up at the restaurant and had no reservations.. I insisted that we did and the guy let us eat there but man he didn't want to .. they take the reservation thing and everything at this resort super serious.. went to the guy in the lobby to find out it we had any for that night and nope.. this guy didn't do anything he said he would. They would not give us reservations for that night and the next night was already full.. poor system... My husband finally had enough and went and talked to the guest relations but they did not do much but give us a reservation for our last night .. Overall the food poor, the pool poor, the beach very poor, the people that worked there uptight and poor... I would not recommend anyone to go here. we stayed in june I feel sorry for anyone going in july or august.. there is no place but your room or dinner to get air conditioning. I must add that I usually stay at only AI resorts and have been to 6 other resorts in the area nothing high end could not afford secrets, or dreams ect.. but nice 4-5 star places and this place was the worst not sure how they got that rating..Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.My husband and I stayed at Animal Kingdom Lodge for 3 nights in March 2005, which turned out to be 2 Nights, because we thought the service and overall stay was so horrible that we left a day early!! We arrived about 7:00pm on Friday and after it took us almost two hours to check in and get our luggage we headed to our room (The room was very dark , had two queen beds and very hot ..the heat was on???) .....we had realized that they didn't give us our park tickets, so we had to head back to the front desk, stood in line again and after about 45 minutes they told us we had to go to the will call window to get our tickets the next day? We also reported that our heat was stuck on and were told that someone would be up to fix it.(you had to leave the door open to breathe) After another 15 minutes or so, we finally got our tickets and headed out to get dinner. I ran up to the room to grab a few thing and there was a girl leaving with our thermostat unit, she said she would repair and replace it before we got back ( she also had 5 other units from other rooms and told me they were having big problems with them that night). There are three restaurants in the hotel, one is upscale, one is a buffet and one is a cafeteria. The Buffet and Upscale restaurant had 1 1/2 - 2 hour waits, and the cafeteria was just that...a cafeteria. Due to the fact that it was very busy at check-in, you were NOT told much. Not where go to take a bus, not where special things where going on, where to get info, etc. It took us about another half an hour to get out of there to find dinner...we ended up grabbing a cab, rather than wait for a bus...we were starving. We went to downtown Disney for dinner, we arrived about a half an hour before the restaurants closed...but we made it! But then we couldn't figure out where the bus picked up to take us back (we had taken the cab, so we couldn't find the bus stop). Finally after walking around the entire place we found the bus stop (quite a walk to get to). We arrived back at our room around 2:00am, and we immediatley checked our thermostat, because it was now frezzing in our room. It was on 65 and blowing cold (it was 49 degree's outside that night)....so we turned it up to 68 degrees and it blew HOT air again....there is NO OFF button so we had to sleep with the patio door open and the heat basting to balance the air?? We were up all night either freezing or sweating...thank goodness for the extra bed, because we had to take all the blakets off it and use them! We actually held our blanket in front of the vent to warm them up because our room was so cold. We finally got up at seven, and just said forget this. We called down to tell them that our thermostat still was not working properly, we asked them to send someone up, as we were going to the park for the day and also to send up extra blankets, just in case! We got back around 8:00 and had planned to changed into our suits and relax in the Jacuzzi after all the walking, we couldn't wait to relax. We opened the door to our room and it was about 90 degree's! We called down to speak with a manager and were told that they would call him and have him call us right away....my husband hung up phone and it rang instantly!!! My husband said hello and the man at the desk that we just spoke with says to my husband in a sarcastic voice," Room # 1234 wants to speak with a manager right away, their heat is in and they just can't stand it any more...blah, blah, blah", This is when my husband speaks up and says, Sir, this is room # 1234 and the guy just stops and says...oh, i must have hit redial, needless to say, my husband just hung up. So now the staff is being sarcastic and rude. So we wait for a call back and a half and hour later we have a knock at our door. Its two repair women, who tell us that the manager sent them instead, and that they were never sent to our room that day to repair it again. One tells us that she did what she could with ours last night, but that they couldn't get new one's until today. Now it 9:00, nobody came to fix or replace it while we were gone all day, and so we wait with them. After they make a phone call to the Head Repair man (on a radio) they ask him to come up, he says he is busy, she tells him it is an emergency and he tell her that she can do it....just check the such and such part. One leaves to get the new part and one stays with us. She returns and goes to replace the part...then a Pipe Burst and boiling hot water is shooting out all over the floor...and hitting the walls across the room....she is soaked and because the water is so hot they are scrambling to find towels or blankets to cover themselves, so they can shut it off and not get burned! It was beyond a nightmare! They now have to move us to another room. I packed everything up and we moved....our room was not on the same Savannah that we had in the beginning, but at this point, we don't care...we put our suits on and now its after 10:00pm and we go to the jacuzzi. I guess the part that really surprised me, is that we never got a phone call back from the manager. After the mess that just happened, I would have expected a manager to call us and apologize, and just check in on us at this point. But we got nothing, not a phone call, not a message on our room phone, not a note! We checked out the later on the next day. Things happen that are out of our control, but I am a business owner and can never imagine not approaching a customer to apologize for something like this. My husband and I get away once a year for a long weekend, as small business owners we work 6 days a week and so look forward to our little getaway, needless to say I would never recommend this property. I have stayed at other Disney deluxe Resorts and can tell you that the service at this Resort is unexceptable. Also, be aware that there are no mini-bars in the rooms, Room service food seems like it comes from the cafeteria restaurant, there is NO poolside service, and you cannot order food from the pool bar. The service level at this Hotel is very poor. As far as the animals go, they are hard to find and are far and few. Customer Service by far needs huge improvement, they just are not living up to what they sell you. I was also told that my package include a private safari for Hotel guest only, yet when we got there upon check-in were told we were not qualified, that this was for special guest at conceriege level only. I actually had another guest checking in directly beside me and overheard her telling her service check-in person the same thing...so when you are told that your package includes a special Safari...get it in writing. Hope this helps in making your vacation a better experience then ours.Okay, so we had a few problems ( bad ones ) and as a consequence we had to move rooms. No big deal, hey it happens, but the hotel won't move you, you have to physically move yourself - again no big deal but you have to do it by 6pm or they give your room away - not good as the room wasn't available every time we went back to get the new key. So finally we move into a new room - excellent you'd think. At 1.30am after we'd just got to sleep there's heavy knocking on the door. After travelling for 30 hours, followed by an awful first night in this hotel, followed with spending most of our first day's holiday waiting to change rooms this is not what we wanted. On answering the door, it's 2 ladies from house keeping looking at me puzzled then apologising and backing away. Very angry, we eventually get back off to sleep. At 3.30am there's a hammering on the door with a male voice shouting ' security - open the door'. What the hell is going on??? I open the door ajar ( it has a security latch on it) and security is demanding to see photo ID. Seriously - at 3.30am in the morning. I refused and asked him what on earth he thought he was doing and told him to stop shouting as just maybe, other guests in the room opposite, were still asleep. When he explained that our room was supposed to be empty and we explained that we'd been moved into it because of a room change he apologised and couldn't explain how it had happened, but the strange thing is, he knew my first name. I tried to sleep again but ended up going down to reception ( no one answers the room phones) . Now the lad at the desk knew nothing, and said the manager on duty was 'unavailable' to me. After demanding he get her on the phone, turns out she's on the other desk due to staff shortages. I go to see her and she couldn't explain how it had happened and apparently she'd asked him to go to the room after housekeeping had reported they couldn't get in. Nothing makes sense here - why were they trying to get into a freshly cleaned room? Why does it take 2 hours for security to come bang on the door. How did he know my name when he was expecting the room to be empty?? Why didn't i believe the other reviews on this place?? Why oh why?? This place sucks big time. We were offered $50 to spend in the hotel food places for 'compensation'. So bearing in mind they make a profit on the food, that $50 probably costs the hotel about $18. So our room was $300 bucks for the night (new year period was pricey) and you offer us $50. Where's the effort?? At least a box of chocolates or even some flowers would have shown thought. The rooms are tired. Bedding is worn, quilts and mattress smell of smoke, bathrooms dirty, wardrobe falling apart, sinks don't drain, showers are a joke - use the shower and flood the bathroom, no facilities in the room ( no coffee, not even a shower cap!) Hair on the floor.Toenails !! Eew! Phone cover missing so you don't know which button is front desk etc. Dust everywhere. Lights not working in the room. Air con surprisingly good. Ipod dock doesn't work on new ipods. Cigarette burns in the furniture. Big chunks out the tables - repaired by colouring them in with black marker pens. What?? Internet reallllllllly slow. Shuttle service less than useless ( although the driver is really nice) Staff couldn't care less. Resort fee a con - $25 a day for what? The swimming pool area shuts down out of season. We stayed in december/january and it was beautiful sunshine. They pipe pool music in the outside pool area which makes you think that you can use the loungers, just not swim in the pool. Why else would they pump music here which is different to the hotel music. Wrong!! Security actually came and moved us and others on - we demanded to speak to management who eventually relented and let us lounge on the loungers as long as we didn't make a mess - are you serious ?? have you even seen the state of the place?? A mess?? They have one pool area that is available to use during out of season subject to weather. It was open the one day, closed the next ( no staff apparently) open the next but no loungers and the kids in the pool complaining the water was freezing. Lifeguard was really nice and good with people's kids but couldn't do anything about the pool temp except apologize. We had the unpleasant experience of dealing with the assistant hotel manager called Liz. If you wander why some hotels respond to comments on trip advisor and either apologize or explain how things had gone wrong or even thank people for positive comments and you wander why some don't? Well the answer is - this hotel couldn't give a monkey's about you. They just don't care. The hotels that respond to trip advisor at least show they care what there clients think. I'm pretty easy to please, have realistic expectations, know things go wrong and I accept this. This hotel works on the basis, there will be another punter tomorrow so who cares about the one today. Bad news guys, word spreads!! trip advisor works !! you'll find out soon enough. Apparently you were pretty good a few years ago - but not know. The casino tables are too dark to use properly so we'd go up to the strip. Tip - just get a cab to the rear entrance of Planet Hollywood and walk up through the Casino onto the strip. With a tip for the cab driver, it will be no more than $10 each way ( actual fare usually was $6.70-$7.10 )Planet Hollywood is much nicer, the Wynn is awesome, the Bellagio is looking a tiny bit tired inside but the staff are great. The Hard Rock - avoid!! Stay somewhere else. You have been warned.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

Never mind that the halls are dark, the rooms are small and the beds are hard as rock, what made it impossible for me and my fiance to stay at this hotel was the fact that both the lobby and the rooms themselves reek of some kind of perfumed chemical! Upon checking in during the early afternoon, we both noticed an overpowering perfume odor emanating through the lobby. As I have traveled EXTENSIVELY for work and never before encountered a lobby that smelled like cheap car freshener, I assumed the offense was coming from a female guest who was checking in ahead of us. But, lo and behold, when we entered our room, we discovered that it was even worse! I'm not sure I can do justice to how overwhelming and sickeningly sweet the smell was, but my eyes immediately started watering, my throat constricted and my head started pounding. We called the front desk ASAP to explain that there was an overwhelming perfumey smell throughout our room. They sent up a porter who matter-of-factly explained that EACH TIME the rooms are cleaned, they are sprayed with something to make them "smell good." He went on to say that he would try to find us an empty room that had not yet been made up for the day. About 20 minutes later, he returned to move us to a room down the hall. It appeared to be a downgrade as the lamp shade hung off the lamp (broken) and there was a large stain on the floor. The smell seemed like it might not be as strong, but I wasn't sure since I was actually having DIFFICULTY BREATHING by this point!! My fiance immediately opened the windows as far as they would go with the hopes of airing out the room and then he took me outside to get me some fresh air. After approximately 20 minutes of walking around, I was feeling better so we returned to the hotel, hopeful that the open windows would have done the trick. Well, upon re-entering our room, I was again assaulted by the overwhelming fumes of whatever it is they spray throughout their space. My headache came pounding back and I found myself nauseous from the smell. It wasn't that the scent itself stunk; it was that the chemicals were so strong that they were literally making me sick to my stomach. My fiance took one look at me, pale with watering eyes, and said, "There is no way you can stay here. I'm having trouble breathing myself." So we went down to the front desk and explained our situation. We were told that the hotel would have been able to refund our money in full on the spot, but because we had "made the mistake" of booking through Travelocity, we would now have to contact them and have a cancellation form faxed over. Once they received the form from Travelocity, they assured us that they would be able to refund our money in full for the first night. They were, however, immediately able to refund our money for the following two nights. I will add that though the clerk at the front desk was forthcoming with this information, he was in no way friendly or apologetic about our situation. In fact, he was fairly rude. So there my fiance and I were in Old Montreal with all our luggage and nowhere to go, and with hoops to jump through in order to get a full refund. What a way to start a vacation. But the story doesn't end there. Once we were finally situated at another hotel (no easy feat to find an opening at the last moment), we contacted Travelocity so that they could fax the cancellation form to the Hotel St Paul. Travelocity said that they first needed to contact the hotel. When they did, the Hotel St Paul told them that if we had not wanted to stay in the hotel, we never should've checked in in the first place! WHAT?! What happened to "just have them fax over a cancellation form so that we can refund your money"? The Hotel St Paul then went on to say that we had been at the hotel for more than 4 hours and for those two reasons combined they were now refusing to refund our money. But it was a boldface lie, as we had not even been IN MONTREAL for 4 hours at that point! The bottom line is that the Hotel St Paul STOLE over $215 from us for a room we were not in for even 2 hours, they lied when they promised us a refund, they were rude to us, and I'm fairly sure they filled our room anyway, since it was very hard for us to find a vacancy elsewhere and there were others on the street looking as well. My question is: how dare the Hotel St Paul ADMIT to spraying chemicals throughout their rooms after I told them that I was having a reaction but then refuse to refund our money? We did not stay at their hotel for the simple reason that we COULD NOT physically stay at their hotel. Had we tried to continue to stay there, I very likely would've had to go to a doctor. As it was, it took hours of me resting in bed with a rag over my head to recover. I was sick from the fumes in that place! Sick! And WHY did the clerk at the front desk tell us that our money would be refunded if they never intended to refund our money? Honestly, I would advise anyone-- especially people who find themselves the least bit sensitive to chemicals-- to look elsewhere. This hotel is waaaay overrated, and the experience was the very worst hotel experience I've ever had, and I have stayed at a lot of hotels! As I said, the halls are dark, the rooms are nothing special, the beds are uncomfortable-- but it is the God-awful fumes permeating the air that will make you wish you'd never set foot in this place. I know there are a lot of positive reviews about this hotel, but I am begging you to heed the negative reviews. Several people have complained of being treated poorly by the staff, and I saw another review where the patrons were told that had they made their reservation through the front desk (via phone) as opposed to through the Hotel's website, they could've gotten a full refund. Excuses, excuses. What difference does it make if you book your reservation over the phone, through their website or through a travel website? If you have people who are so unhappy with what they're encountering, maybe the staff of Hotel St Paul should pay attention! At the very least, an apology with a refund is in order. Think twice, people. There are much better hotels out there. Much better.Not to sound too negative but be wary of the delivary.THE ARSENIC WORRY.I'm a mother of two young babies who were fed this formula for 6 months.  At the time I purchased and used this formula in 2009-2010, I was incredibly happy and confident that I had found the perfect formula for my babies.  It smelled and tasted different from other formulas that we had tried on our babies.  I compared all the nutrient labels and believed that it was equivalent to other formulas commercially sold.  I told everyone I knew about the product, encouraging other mothers to use it for their babies.  Since learning of the arsenic in Nature's One formulas, I'm angry and very scared about the possible health effects as a result of my babies ingesting this arsenic through the formula.  This is the only way I know how to deal with some of my emotions--let other mothers know about this very important issue.<br /><br />I'm not a "hired writer" (but I'm certain that the mere fact that I'll be accused of it again by the company and its followers will be enough "proof" for some).  This seems to be the common term the company and its followers are using on many of the online forums like Amazon and Facebook to label and harass mothers who have been brave enough to raise questions about the safety of the product.  For all the truly worried-sick mothers asking too many questions, this is a debate that must be carried on despite the tediousness of the continuous harassment by the company and its followers because the safety of our babies and an entire generation of people are at risk.  The company and its followers are successfully getting postings deleted from online forums in order to suppress thoughts and opinions that it doesn't like because they raise important and valid issues.  Apparently, we're asking some of the right questions--questions that require answers that the company doesn't want to give to parents.  It's not just about this company however.  This is just the starting point.  It's about getting the truth out of the FDA and getting our government to set definable and safe standards for arsenic in our food.<br /><br />First, as unfortunate as it was to discover that there is arsenic in baby formula, it is only the tip of the iceberg.  As I've devoted my time to researching and reading scientific papers and articles, I am just starting to understand that arsenic in our food supply is more prevalent and more dangerous than the public realizes.  The scientific communities around the world have been studying and writing about the dangers of long term arsenic poisoning from water and food for years, and yet it's a fact that most people weren't even aware of until now.  How many of us knew that the U.S. standard for arsenic in our water supply was set at the level it is now (10 parts per billion) not because it was the lowest and safest level that could be achieved, but because the government agency responsible did a cost analysis and determined that it would be too expensive to remove more arsenic than that from our water supply?<br /><br />I suppose it shouldn't be surprising given the fact that the FDA has been "monitoring arsenic in foods for 20 years" (yes, it has known about arsenic in chicken meat for years) but has never taken actions until now to limit this toxin in our food supply.  I guess that the majority of the public (who aren't involved in this debate over Nature's One's formula) will continue on with their lives without ever knowing about the negative health effects of ingesting arsenic every day through water and food.  The majority of us will live a reasonable number of years and suddenly find out that we have some form of cancer, and think it was predominantly genetics that determined our illness, never dreaming that it could've been the arsenic in our food and water.  Regardless of the reasons why the FDA and various agencies never acted to protect the people from arsenic toxicity, it's enough to know that scientific communities have been urging governments to set "safe" standards to limit the amount of arsenic consumption.  It's intolerable to think that the government has been allowing this to go on for so long.  Isn't it time that we demand better from the government of the greatest nation on earth?<br /><br />As I step back from all the debate over whether Nature's One's organic formula is safe or not, I realize that this will be an ongoing war of words.......with no immediate winners.  I imagine that the only thing we'll be left to deal with will be the long term health problems of a small percentage of babies who were unlucky enough to have been fed this formula.  It's sad to think that by simply refusing to admit that the levels of arsenic found in its formulas are unsafe, the company is possibly jeopardizing the health of many babies.  We as parents did the research on all the available formulas and decided to trust this company with our babies' health.  We believed that we were getting the best formula on the market for our babies; we trusted that this organic company was testing for dangerous toxins like arsenic in its products.  Naturally, we trusted, never imagining that an organic company would sell an organic product containing brown rice syrup that was made from rice grown in soil contaminated with arsenic.<br /><br />As of yesterday, the company has decided to release its test results on its website.  I read the numbers, and at first, it meant nothing to me.  I did some research and tried to understand what this truly meant.  From what I was able to find online, my understanding was that the WHO standards that the company cites as safe (2.1 mcg/kg of bodyweight/daily) were set in 1983 and were based on standards for arsenic in water that were much higher (50 parts per billion) than the current standard of 10 parts per billion.  Arsenic experts from around the world agree that this standard is outdated and needs to be revised using "a firm scientific basis."  According to experts, this WHO standard is a "fallback position" due to the lack of current standards for arsenic in food, and not one that is necessarily safe.<br /><br />My fears about what the future may hold for my babies in terms of their health keep me up at nights.  I wonder, and I'm sad about what I might have done to them in my quest for the best.  I only pray and hope that all the babies around the world who were fed this formula will show the amazing resiliency of the human species, and that we as their parents will have the strength to deal with whatever may come.<br /><br />Articles:<br />"Arsenic and Rice"<br />"Getting to the Bottom of Arsenic Standards and Guidelines"<br />"A Bitter Sweetner in Baby Formula"<br />"Arsenic, Organic Foods, and Brown Rice Syrup"This is the letter we sent to them detailing our trip. We haven't gotten any reply or acknowledgement To Whom It May Concern. . . I wanted to write this email to you as soon as we returned home to inform you of the horrible experience that myself and my husband had at your hotel over the past three days. We arrived Thursday afternoon to a very rude man behind the reception desk. He didn't offer to help us with the bags, told us nothing about the amenities or services of the hotel. My husband unloaded the car about a block away and drove to find parking while I carried both of our bags and additional items about a block to the lobby. I tried to get the attention of the man at the reception desk, and when he didn't help me with the bags, I literally had to ask a stranger on the street to help me open the door and carry our things. After packing everything into the elevator while my husband parked our car, I was very disappointed by the size of our room. It was so small and cheaply decorated it was insulting. We live in Rochester with in laws in Buffalo so we spend a lot of time traveling to Toronto for various events and wanted to try a more historic hotel. From your website and literature, I am significantly surprised by your lack of quality. The bed was only a few feet off of the ground and the headboard was scratched and looked like it was going to fall off of the wall. The chair that was at the desk had a broken back, one of the doors on the mirrored closet was off of the track and broken. These items, paired with a lovely view of an alleyway just made for a more insulting first experience. You should also be aware of some additional problems with the room and the service that we experienced during our stay. The shower was broken in multiple places - the plumbing into the shower head wasn't tightened correctly so one stream of water actually shot out over the top of the shower door onto the floor of the bathroom and the second sprout of water sprayed up to the lighting fixture in the ceiling. My husband was able to redirect the one stream of water, but the other still sprayed over the top of the shower door. My husband used the bathroom and thought there was a problem with the toilet when the tank continued to run, so he removed the top of the toilet tank and we COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT WE SAW. Inside the toilet tank we found unopened bottles of wine coolers being stored in the toilet tank. I have no idea how long they were there, but the caps were rusted shut and the water was totally brown. I don't have to tell you how disgusting this is. We took pictures of the toilet tank, which I have attached. Throughout our stay there seemed to be a general disregard for guests by the staff. Friday night we were waiting for the elevator and two employees from the cleaning crew had large grey bins of towels and other laundry. They literally pushed past us to get into the elevator and said nothing. I HOPE i don't have to explain that this is not proper etiquette in a hotel setting or any setting. I also noticed a lot of signs about not smoking in the hotel and we stayed on the fourth floor and I can tell you that the people staying on our floor were certainly smoking. The hotel smelled horrible. I informed someone working at the front desk, which seemed very disinterested. Over our stay we informed various people at the front desk about our issues and not ONCE did anyone offer to repair anything, compensate us in anyway and when we checked out we again told the man at the front desk about our experience and he said he would inform the manager. He then thanked us for not yelling at him like other guests have in the past. So, since we got no satisfaction or compensation, I felt that I would put this in writing and send it along to you. We feel so insulted that this is the first thing that I have to do when returning from our weekend. As I said earlier, we travel to Toronto a lot and wanted to try a different hotel. We have stayed all over downtown and I promise you that: 1. We will NEVER stay at your hotel again 2. We WILL tell everyone who asks about our vacation exactly where we stayed and the experience that we had. I am also a corporate trainer who travels extensively and believe me, my employees and other trainers would love to know about this experience since they travel often. 3. Depending upon your response and your action thereafter, I will write a detailed online review which will articulate every single item that I discussed in this email as well as the pictures of the conditions. 4. I will also post this information on my blog as well as face book. I look forward to your immediate action and response. Room 403I was just in New York for a 2 day interview so I wanted to stay someplace inexpensive yet not too far away from the office I had to go to (near Grand Central). My mother and I looked online and saw that Hotel Pennsylvania had a reasonable rate and was in a good location. I arrived at the hotel late Monday night and stepped out of the cab into a rather motley mix of people, some not so appealing looking. But I chalked that up to the area probably being a hangout for teenagers and whatnot. I walked into the lobby and it was the same thing. I wasn't worried, however. Sure there were more random people walking around the hotel than I was used to, but it was near a station after all. Most hotels would ask non-patrons and loiterers to leave... but I shrugged it off. In the midst of my check in, a man came up to the front desk yelling about some problem that was supposed to have been resolved already. He had an unfamiliar accent so I couldn't make out just what the issue was. I did notice, however, that the front desk girl conducted herself rather unprofessionally. But I figured it was late so she was probably tired and frustrated by now. I wrote it off. I headed for the elevators where I had to show my room key before I could even enter the elevator area. This was the point where I actually first braced myself. While this sounds like a comforting security measure, I've been to hundreds of hotels all around the world and have never seen such a practice. I found myself a little wary wondering why they would need such a precaution. Maybe the area wasn't as safe as Time Square where I usually stay. When I stepped off the elevator and onto the 4th floor, I knew with a sinking feeling that my time there would not be pleasant. I was hit with a rush of stale cigarette smoke. Apparently my non-smoking room was on a smoking floor which rather negated its efficacy. The hall carpet looked as though its original color was buried underneath quite a few layers of dirt and grime. Stains large and small were everywhere. I was a little frightened of seeing so many stains considering that the lighting was inordinately dim and further hampered by a mist of smoke. If that's what I could see, how much was I missing? Many of the directional signs to the rooms where hand drawn as quite a few of the signs had fallen off probably long ago. What was even more fun for me, there were no signs to my room at all. I had to roam the dark, dank hallway aimlessly. Fortunately I found it just before I was about to go downstairs to complain. Many of the doors to the rooms were covered with some sort of green, plastic decoration. It's hard to describe, but they were obviously old and tattered. Quite a few of the doors were missing them and the ones that were still hanging often had holes. I arrived in my room only to find that my carpet was filthier than the carpet in the hallways. So filthy was it that I never took off my shoes. There was a double bed with an obviously worn bedspread, an armchair about 30 years old that looked as though it had never been cleaned in all that time, and a desk that looked only a few years old but that had a chair whose cushion was already covered in stains. As I walked in I immediately smelled the musky odor of mold, and soon I found ONE of its sources. There was a little mini-fridge of the floor with black mold visible on the outside of it. I was horrified. I timidly entered the bathroom hoping for a bright spot but afraid of something worse. The towels and washclothes were folded on what looked like the type of bathroom shelving you'd find in a high school locker room. The problem was that the holes that were part of the shelving design, probably meant to prevent water buildup, were full of rust and dirt. Apparently noone at this hotel had ever heard of LYSOL (fortunately I had and came armed with a bottle). I read one review where someone walked into a room there and it reeked of bleach, they were appalled. Me, I only wish I'd had the smell of bleach in my room. I gingerly pulled back the shower curtain to spray the area with Lysol, only to find that no amount of Lysol would convince me to bathe myself in such a place. There was no plug for the drain so I could clearly see the corroded, rusted, and dirt encrusted area around and inside it. The enamel on the tub was cracked and peeling in many places, creating partially opened crevices where it was impossible to clean. Maybe if the whole thing had been soaked in pure bleach..... From what I saw, either the tub wasn't cleaned after the last guest (or few guests) or whoever cleaned it didn't know how to do their job. To be fair, maybe they were just as grossed out as I was a preferred to avoid it. All I wanted to do was survive till morning when I could find other accommodations. I went to the window to close the curtains (my room looked into another room) and I happened to glance down at the ancient fan/heater attached to the wall. To my horror and nausea even now, the vent was filled with mold, grime, dirt and only the Lord knows what else. It was black with layer upon layer of filth. Absolutely disgusting and I'm sure a health hazard and code violation of some sort. It's just as well the window was stuck and didn't close because I felt I would rather freeze all night than even let my pinky touch the dial on that contraption. And I did. I spent a restless night hearing people come down the fire escape through my hopelessly ajar window. I'll try to cut this longwinded story short on only mention in passing things like the stains on the inside of the bedspread, the filthy ironing board, the lack of a bolt lock on the door, and the fleas. Needless to say I hightailed it out of there early in the morning. I checked out a couple of housekeeping carts on my way out and noticed that there were no cleaning products whatsoever. There were only refills of toilet paper and changes of linen. Actually, this place was such that you had to put a sign on your door saying that you wanted them to clean the room to get service at all. They have a $50 early check out fee that got waived for me, which is just as well for them as I was appalled enough to make my complaints known which is something I'm usually loathe to do. I ended up staying at the Comfort Inn on 46th St. which turned out to be $10 cheaper a night, almost on the corner of Times Square, closer to my interview, and CLEAN. Granted, I had just left hell so anything else felt like heaven. I know others have mentioned that their in the midst of renovating and that some of the rooms are ok. But as for me, I wouldn't take the risk. Friends don't let friends stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania.We went to Vegas for the Badgers vs. UNLV game. We were traveling with a group of about 6 couples from WI. My husband and I were the first to arrive in Vegas and Hooters on 9/5/07. We had been on planes since 5am and it was now 2pm our time and it was HOT in Vegas. All I wanted to do was get a cold beer and change my clothes. Upon arrival they have brilliantly placed the bar right next to check-in. I was able to satisfy my first desire by ordering a cold beer. Check in was great. Easy and quick. Although, for some reason we got 2 double beds instead of a king. No biggee, me and the hubby will snuggle. We proceeded to our room 806 in the Bayview tower. The room sort of look like the pictures. The decorations were all what I expected. What I didn't expect were the stains on the carpet or the rust on the bathtub. There was also cracked, peeling paint on our bathroom walls. The view left a lot to be desired. We could see the back of MGM along with the exhaust fans on top of the Hooters roof and parking garage. Not much for an inspiring view. However, really for the price and it being Vegas I wasn't expecting a palace. Just something clean and functional. I immediately opened my suitcase and grabbed some cooler clothes. I went into the bathroom to change. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something scurry across the wall into the corner by the mirror. I looked closer to find an insanely large COCKROACH. First of all, I have never seen a live one. Second, I have never seen anything that big except on like the Discovery Channel. Disgusting!! I made my husband kill it. I am not a prude, though. One bug isn't going to scare me off. Although, now I was inspecting every nook and cranny of that room. I didn't find any of it's friends so we carried on and left to go to Downtown Las Vegas for the day. We returned late that evening and ordered room service. Room service was good and prompt. I took a shower that night. Which led to another discovery. My shower curtain had mildew all over it. I was so tired and so sweaty from the 100 degree heat I just didn't even care. I carefully washed up trying desperately to not let any body part make contact with the shower curtain. Gross!! The next morning I was walking around the carpet barefoot while we made plans for the day. I went to get dressed and put on my shoes. As I leaned over to put on my socks I noticed the bottoms of my feet. To my horror they were dirty and black. Did I mention I took a shower the night before? Yep, all I walked on that morning was the carpet in our hotel room. Puke!!! This was my final straw. I was now just grossed out by the uncleanliness of the place. I called the Manager, Wendy. I told her about the bug, shower curtain, and my feet. She seemed very calm and non-responsive. Even started telling me how yes, bugs in the desert are bigger. They seek out moisture and sometimes come in through the vents. I kept thinking, ok, but I am EIGHT floors up!! Also, why is she telling me this like it is something that is common. If I am customer service or a Manager at a hotel I would not want my guests to think there are more bugs. I would act completely appalled and tell them that is unheard of and apologize profusely. She finally asked if I would like to change rooms. She said the set of rooms I stayed in are not as nicely renovated as the Oceanview ones. She could change my room and the bellman could help us. We just had to do it before 6pm that night. We already had plans for the day and were about to walk out the door. I told her I would call her back and we would try to meet the 6pm deadline. Problem was, we had completely unpacked our suitcases. I told her if we didn't meet her deadline then at the bare minimum I would like my shower curtain replaced. I mean really is that all she could offer. To inconvenience us more by making us pack back up and now moving into another room basically identical to ours, but "possibly" in better shape. We ended up going out with our group of friends, having loads of fun on the strip, and did not get back until late. Past the 6pm deadline. However, we did notice our shower curtain had been changed by the cleaning service. What we also did was from the night before when we ordered room service was accidentally drop a french fry by our bed. We joked that morning about it and I said that would be my test to see if they cleaned it up. Yeah, it was still there. Beds were made. Towels and toiletries replaced, but that stupid french fry was still there. This became our gauge on how well the cleaning crew performed. Yep, that french fry never moved the entire 5 days we were there!!! I, personally, don't think they vaccum. I never saw a vaccum by one of the cleaning carts. I did see a man vaccuum the hallway once outside our door, but that was it. I also question whether they sweep the bathroom. I dropped a rubberband one morning and the next day it was still there. I think they simply change your towels, empty trash cans, give you toiletries, wipe the sink/tub, and call it a day. Even glasses and empty soda cans weren't thrown out for us. Like they thought we were going to the local recycler or something. I don't know. (??) In WI our hotels clean top to bottom. Maybe that isn't the norm in Vegas. No, that cannot be this is like our 6th time in Vegas and never have I seen such poor cleaning in a casino hotel. Especially a hotel that is realitively new to Vegas, has a well established brand, and is trying to make a name for itself as a Vegas strip hotel competitor. Unbelievable. Therefore, if you like creepy crawlers, black dirty feet, stained up carpets, and living in trash. By all means stay at Hooters. Its' cheap, but you have to be willing to comprimise on clean. Trust me your not getting any sort of Vegas Strip luxury hotel staying here. YIKES!! ** We took pictures. I am in process of getting them developed. I will post them as soon as I do. The only thing we missed was the bug. My husband killed it and flushed it down toilet before I could snap a picture. Seriously, it was the size of a walnut. Makes me shiver thinking about it. --Sincerely a Grossed Out Badger FanOverprices hotel for poor experience HOTEL REVIEW OF THE PRESCOTT HOTEL 鈥?SAN FRANCISCO: I rarely take time to write a review on a hotel. Isn鈥檛 it easier just to be unhappy 鈥?and tell yourself you would never return again? But I feel compelled to write this 鈥?partly because others deserve to know 鈥?and party because this is the beauty of the internet. So others will know.I stayed at The Prescott over a long weekend in mid November of 2005. I was looking for a hotel room 鈥?and found that the Westin, Hyatt and other larger hotels were sold out due to several conventions in town. I opted for the 鈥渦pgraded Club Level鈥?at a price I thought reasonable if it lived up to expectations (in the low $200s). I was attracted by the several of the advertising words that The Prescott uses鈥? 鈥淪mall boutique hotel鈥uxury hotel鈥?or get this one: 鈥溾€rivate Union Square retreat鈥︹€?The hotel claims, 鈥渦nsurpassed luxury of our Club Level鈥? the Prescott Hotel, a Kimpton Hotel, offers a world-class luxury hotel experience for discriminating travelers.I don鈥檛 think so.First of all 鈥?this hotel, due to its history, is doomed to begin with. In its early days 鈥?the hotel was a small 鈥渟peak easy.鈥?The rooms are incredibly small 鈥?requiring you to either open the close door or the bathroom door. Not both at the same time. They do their best to distract you from the size 鈥?adding nice linens (now the trend for all) and giving you Aveda grooming products, as does the Westin. So, if the room is not so wonderful 鈥?then perhaps the service? They claim to give you 鈥溾€ervices expected from a Mobil Four-Star and AAA Four-Diamond luxury hotel.鈥?Such as what? Valet parking at the hotel is $38 per night. Although this is expected these days from most hotel rooms. They do offer preferred reservations at Postrio, a long ago inspiration from Wolfgang Puck who had now moved on. They talk about having twice daily maid service. But watch out. They will annoy you to death! The maids are told they must finish their work by 3:00. If you happen to be sleeping in late or come back to the room 鈥?and are not timed to their schedule, they will incessantly knock on your door and ask when the can service your room. Even if you hang your 鈥淒o not disturb sign鈥?out! I complained to the fron desk 鈥?and he simply said, 鈥淲e know 鈥?but if they don鈥檛 get them done 鈥?then they have to rush at the last minute and they don鈥檛 want to do that!鈥?What kind of service is that?The location is indeed a few blocks from Union Square. If you take the right streets back to the hotel 鈥?you are all right. If you deviate just a bit 鈥?you find yourself on streets where you are accosted 3-4 times every block by panders who want donations. But sadly 鈥?that is the case with many streets these days in downtown San Francisco.Do you get what you pay for? When paying the amount for The Club Level 鈥?you believe you are getting an upgrade. The rooms are still the same size. And in fact, getting to the rooms become a bit of a pain in the butt. For some reason 鈥?the hotel purchased the upper floors of a building behind the original building. In order to get to this famed CLUB LEVEL room 鈥?you must first take an elevator up to the fourth floor 鈥?and the walk across an enclosed ramp to take you to the back building. Once their, I had to take another elevator to the 7th floor and down a small hallway 鈥?in which my luggage and myself and to walk single file to get to the room. But wait 鈥?it should be worth it for the famous Postrio inspired happy hour? First of all 鈥?happy hour here is from 4:30 鈥?6:30. In San Francisco? Who goes to happy hour then? Usually 鈥?most hotels have happy hour from 6-8 鈥?so that you can have a cocktail before you go out to dinner. Not here. This is a chow line for cheap people who are being sure to get their monies worth. For this weekend 鈥?the lounge was filled with older folks who were in town to attend a local university football game. For this crowd 鈥?having unlimited martini鈥檚 at 4:30 in the afternoon is a plus. (And I must admit 鈥?they nice chap at the bar is charming and poured freely!) But surely the appetizers would be great? Well 鈥?get this. You think you are getting wonderful woodburning fireplace pizza from the famous Wolfgang Puck. Well 鈥?perhaps he did the dough. But that is about it. Poor Julio at The Prescott 鈥?the bartender in this small lounge just off the ramp between the two building is also a pizza cooker. He takes out frozen pizzas that are given to him, tosses on a few pieces of basil leaves or red peppers 鈥?and tosses them in a small convection oven in his little bar closet. He can do one little pizza at a time 鈥?and so the guests all wait around, knives and forks in hand 鈥?and when one gets done 鈥?he walks around sliding little pieces of the pizza, as he were feeding the seals down at Pier 39! And if this tastes like the pizza鈥檚 downstairs 鈥?then I think old Wolfgang has lost it. If I were him 鈥?I would be horrified to know that his food was being marketed and served this way! What is funny is that, on the one night when I tried this (and not again!), many of the individuals were commenting to each other that this would be their meal for the night. My gawd! Wrong crowd!Breakfast in the morning is one toaster with some bagels. A few kinds of cereal. And one large pot of coffee that burns after the first hour.The hotel advertisement claims that 鈥淲ith our exemplary service and attention to detail, you'll find that the Prescott Hotel, a Kimpton Hotel, offers some of the best accommodations in San Francisco.鈥?I have stayed at many hotel in San Francisco 鈥?and I assure you 鈥?it is not true. Spend the money at any of the other real four or five star hotels. Kimpsy claims that every hotel 鈥渢ells a story.鈥?I am not sure this is a good story. I caution you. Unless of course 鈥?you want to be a seal!I have never in my life sent back food before, but I simply had to, and the waiter argued with me over this.Have just returned to the UK having spent 4 nights at the Wellington booked through Thomas Cook and we can confidently say we will not be booking another trip with Thomas Cook and when we do return to NYC we will not be staying at the Wellington! This holiday was a disaster from start to finish. The only positives were NYC and British Airways (surprising I know)! We arrived at the Hotel having been collected by a Thomas Cook representative (who later claimed she didn't work for TC but was quite happy to collect her commission from selling various tours) - there was no register or check conducted to make sure everyone was collected, and we later heard of couples who had been left at the airport or left at the hotel. On check in we learned that no room had been reserved for us and after lenghty conversations with both the TC rep and the Hotel Manager a room was found for us for two nights, but with no guarantee of anything further. We were told our rep would resolve this by the time we arrived for the NY City Tour the following morning. Initally, we were offered the option of sharing a suite with another couple we had never met before, who were in precisely the same predicament as we were. The room we were given for our first night was quite frankly a disgrace and looked nothing like the pictures on the website, or brochure that we saw - we can only assume these images were of the penthouse suite. The room was dirty, worn, badly in need of redecoration, the bed sheets had not been ironed and looked creased and possibly slept in (!?) the bathroom was cramped and again looked unclean and to top it off the pipes banged throughout the night making sleep virtually impossible. The following morning we got up and resolved to make the best of our situation, after all, the room would have been sorted and we had our tour to look forward to. On meeting our rep in the lobby she presented us with the TC booking reference and assured us that by simply showing this at reception a room would be found for us. Alas, this was not the case the Welington's manager said it was not their booking reference and their was no reference of us on their system. As such he could only guarantee us accommodation for another night and then by taking a copy of our credit card. We then spoke to the TC rep, afterall she would be able to speak to the manager and either arrange a return flight home or alternate accommodation. At least that is what we though a TC rep would do...but of course she doesn't work for TC and as such "emphathised with our situation but had done all she could...." With no help from the rep and no help from the Hotel Manager, we asked to make a phone call to TC in the UK. Obviously the hotel would allow us to dial TC or our rep would provide us with the faclities to do so...but NO! We had to pay to call the UK, no phone was provided for us, instead we had to use a combination of our mobile phone and phone cards. With the situation unresolved we were then unable to go on our booked tour (as to do so would mean all UK offices would have been closed and we would have been trusting in the compentency of the Hotel staff to resolve everything by our return). After speaking to the UK and wasting an entire morning, buying phone cards, using public phones, and being passed from pillar to post, the Hotel Manager then phoned us to say he had been able to arrange for a King Size Room - an upgrade...this was after having been told that no rooms were available. I would just like to stress at this point that not once were we offered an apology and we found both the TC rep and hotel staff to be rude and unfriendly. We then had to move our bags from our old room to the new one. The Kingsize room was OK, but not what you would expect from a supposed superior option. It was essentially the same as our previous room but larger, with a slightly less frequent melody coming from the pipes. Our holiday then improved as we spent the vast majority of our time out and about and as far away from the Hotel as possible. Our transfer back to the JFK airport from the hotel went fairly smoothly, until check in at the airport where no record was found of any of our parties bookings. Therefore not everyone was able to be booked onto the flight and had to be diverted to Heathrow. Hardly, the perfect end to your holiday and not what you want after about 12 hours of travelling. We will be seeking appropriate compensation from TC for the shambles we experienced and will update this review with the outcome. To sum up - New York is an amazing city and really is a must to experience, however if you do go - don't use Thomas Cook and certainly do not stay at The Wellington.This was a dreadful stay at a dreadful hotel. I am generally a Starwood fan, but not in this case. We reserved two suites using Starpoints for a long weekend with friends. Our friends checked into suite 201. It did have a nice balcony overlooking Chartres Street. The closet rod was not attached to the wall, but they were handy and fixed it themselves. (They had a screwdriver with them, go figure!) The door to the minibar cabinet was completely off its hinges, which they politely ignored. There was a TV in the bathroom, for which the remote didn't work. It ultimately was fixed by maintenance - with duct tape. The shower was in a moldy claw-foot tub which was difficult for them to access. That was the good experience. We were originally put into the suite on the opposite side of the second floor. There was a loud courtyard speaker directly outside the bedroom window, so there was no rest possible until night-time when the sound went off. They said they could "turn it down" â€“ but we didn't want to be fighting that battle for 4 days, so we asked to be moved. No other suites were available. They promised to refund us the point difference between a suite and a regular room, which they did after I called to bug them a few days later. They put us on the 5th floor overlooking the courtyard. It was a large room, but most of the space taken up by huge dormers which were useless space. The shutters on the dormers were broken so they didnâ€™t close properly. Neither the floor in the dormers nor the shutters on the windows had been cleaned any time in recent memory. There were huge stains on the carpet. There was a leak around the shower door, so it was moldy and the plaster was falling apart. The paint on the walls generally was dirty and scratched up, so that the drywall showed through in several places. There was a disco right across the courtyard from this room, so it was even noisier than the original room. One of the bedside lamps was completely broken (the bulb socket hanging to the side) - maintenance did fix that. The front desk promised to move us to 204 the next day, a connecting room to our friends' suite, and to refund a night's worth of points for our inconvenience (that credit came through without a hitch). They asked us to leave our bags packed so they could be moved while we were out. We returned around 4:30 p.m. The keys we were given didnâ€™t work. So back downstairs. Ordinarily, that wouldnâ€™t have been a big deal, but only one of two elevators was in service the entire time and the stairway doors were locked from the bottom, so every trip upstairs required a lengthy wait for the elevator. Second time the keys worked. Another elevator wait - and this time our bags weren't in the room. Yet another trip downstairs for my partner. He was told the bags were in the hallway outside the room. Valuables left sitting in the hall, are you kidding? No matter, they weren't there anyway. Where were they? No one knew. After a few minutes of waiting and no news, a curt word to the desk clerk elicited from the duty manager, not a query as to what was wrong and whether she could help, but an admonition not to speak impolitely to her staff. Ultimately the bags were found. My partner had to lug them all up himself, no offer of help. After another wait for the elevator, of course. It was a small room, but the balcony was nice and we could share the sitting area with our friends' suite. And it was not quite as dirty as the room on the 5th floor. The TV didn't work. Maintenance fixed it by fiddling with the nest of wires under the desk and replaced the batteries in the remote. At least two of the outlets in the room (including the outlet by the sink for the hair dryer) didn't work, but we didnâ€™t bother with reporting those. Overnight the room became stifling. The next morning, maintenance told us that was "normal," that the cool air was escaping through the connecting door to the suite (which had been closed during the night and, in any event, did have cool air and working a/c) and (most importantly) that the thermostat had to be set at 40 degrees F to work. We gave up on that as well. The final evening in this room the hot water stopped working as we were trying to get ready for dinner. A call to "whatever, whenever" resulted in enough lukewarm water for a quick shower, though no explanation. On return from our evening out, it was completely off again. A call downstairs produced no results or reply. About an hour later, we called Starwood customer service. They opened a file on our case and called the hotel. All they got was excuses - it is an old hotel, it takes the hot water a while to get there. All transparent fibs, as usually the hot water worked fine, and in any event it was completely back on the next morning. The issues werenâ€™t solely room-related. As I already noted, there was only one working elevator. The (limited) common areas were as dirty and decrepit as the rooms. The linens were stringy and threadbare. Absent a request, housekeeping only left one bar of soap per room, so it had to be moved back and forth between the sink and the shower. A call to room service the first morning for coffee was dismissed with a reply that there was complimentary coffee in the lobby. So we went down â€“ only to find no cups. They scrounged a couple up for us. Several times after that, there were either no cups or the coffee pot was empty. We took to buying coffee across the street. There does not appear to be anyone actually managing this horrible little hotel. Stay far, far away.I called this hotel's reservations center directly and made one reservation for two adults. One confirmation was submitted to my email address; and after finding a different hotel I preferred to stay at during my visit to Orlando, I canceled my reservation through the link attached to the inital confirmation in the appropriate time I was given to avoid any charges being made to my credit card; and I was issued an cancellation number. While driving on the Florida turnpike (from Michigan) the day following the arrival date I was initally supposed to have checked in, a female from this hotel called my cell phone inquiring if I was still arriving at their hotel (sounded pretty desperate to me for business). I informed the individual that I had canceled the reservation and had a cancellation number in my email account and I was driving on the highway and that I needed to remain focused since traffic was somewhat congested. Nevertheless, she goes on to inform me that they (the hotel) didn't have a cancellation for me. I once again informed her that she was calling my cell phone while I was driving on the highway; and she goes on to inquire if I could forward the cancellation to her email address. DUH? What part of I am driving on the highway didn't she understand? I then informed her that when I arrived to where I was going, I would print the cancellation and bring it to her. She then goes on to ask me if I were in the Orlando area? DUH AGAIN! How many times had I informed her that I was driving on the highway enroute to this area? Anyways, when I arrived to the beautiful resort I elected to stay in, I was extremely exhausted being that I was the only driver in my vehicle; so, I checked in, showered and went to sleep. The following day, I had a strict schedule to adhere to and was not able to take the canceled reservation to this hotel; so, I wait until the next day, open my email and OMG, I have an email from this hotel asking me to submit to a survey for a one night stay. Huh? Immediately, I decided to check my bank account and discovered this hotel had charged me for a one night stay subsequent to me informing their representative that I had canceled the reservation; so, here comes the good part. When I arrive at the hotel with my canceled reservation, I am told that I made two reservations? Huh? Whoever I initially spoke to when making the reservation obviously has a hearing problem because I informed the reservation agent that I was making one (1) reservation for two (2) adults. Why did she list on my reservation I had a party of four (4) adults? Then, the front desk tells me that I made the reservation online. I told the woman that I did not make the reservation online, I called directly into the hotel because had I made the reservation online, I would have made it through my Gold Points account and this reservation was not in my Gold Points account; and that she could open my account to verify it. Then, she tells me that I made two reservations under the same confirmation number. If this were true, then, when I canceled the one reservation, the other reservation should have canceled also. Hmm, this seems correct to me. Okay, I was seeing how desperate they were in thinking I was going to yield to allowing them to keep money from my account that they had already fraudulently charged me for; so, I stood my grounds with informing them that I did NOT make two reservations; and they stood there toying with their system until I pulled out my cell phone and called my bank in their presence. All of sudden, the IGNORANT front desk manager tells the billing representative to refund my money because they didn't want to continue dealing with the issue. This raised a concern with both me and the representative from my bank (who heard her) and I reported the matter to the FRAUD department at my bank because it was very obvious that this hotel doubles the reservation on people who cancels their reservation as a measure of charging the customer for at least one night when the customer decides not to stay at their hotel. They stood in my face and told so many LIES, it was both pathetic and unprofessional. Had I made the reservation online, why would I list my name as Mrs. when that is not my appropriate title? Why wouldn't the reservation be listed in my Gold Points account? Why would I make a reservation for four adults when I was only traveling with my daughter? Why wouldn't I choose the AAA rate opposed to their best available rate (which is always higher)? BE CAREFUL WHEN MAKING RESERVATIONS DIRECTLY WITH THIS HOTEL BECAUSE IF YOU CHOOSE TO CANCEL, TEN TIMES OUT OF TEN, YOU'RE GOING TO BE PENALIZED FOR DECIDING NOT TO STAY AT THEIR HOTEL WHEN THERE ARE OTHER HOTELS THAT ARE MORE QUALITATIVE THAN THEIRS! I'm sure the majority of all of these GOOD REVIEWS are made by hotel employees. Nothing is perfect; and I have come to discover that this hotel actually is pitiful! I would suggest to anyone to sustain your cancellation number because if you don't, it is their word against yours and ten times out of ten, you will not get your money back. Now, this is a primary example of how businesses seek to take advantage of consumers in these extreme economic times. How pathetic! I wouldn't suggest this hotel to no one, even if they paid me to do it! UNPROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES EQUATE TO UNPROFESSIONAL BUSINESS...ATTEMPTED RIP OFF!Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever.

The rooms are so poorly lit that you need one to find your phone, let alone enjoy a book. Every guest I spoke to had the same problem, so this wasn't an aberration limited to our room. AirConditioning: The thermostats in the rooms are just props. It was so unbearably cold, that we would turn off the AC completely but it remained cold-and between the omnipresent darkness and the frigid temps, it was pretty much like living in a cave. Again-not just my room but every other guest I spoke to as well. (The "Living Room" is also unbearably cold.) Music music music music-everywhere. In the lobby, in the restaurants, by the pool-IN THE POOL-on the beach. You simply couldn't escape it. And it was the same mind-numbing, generic Latin or Brazilian, lounge or house MUZAK, played over and over, all day, ad nauseum. It was like being stuck in an elevator! I suspect this stuff was produced expressly for the W, as none of the songs or singers were recognizable. My theory is that using this kind of crap is a cost saving measure, as it means not having to pay fees to the musical licensing agencies for the use of real songs. Whatever the reason-the music is unbearable, unceasing and oppressive. (It should be mentioned that music in the pool is a fun novelty for about 5 minutes but when you swim underwater, the treble heavy frequencies quickly become not only un-relaxing but positively painful.) Also- the music begins IN THE MORNING. If you have a poolside room, I hope you don't want to sleep late. The worst of it however, is the fact that it is pumped onto the beach. I came to the W to relax. That means ocean breezes and the sound of the surf-not 20 different version of The Girl From Ipanema. SPA you say?? How does an expensive hotel like this NOT have a sauna or a hot tub? (However, if they did, they would most certainly charge for it's use-unthinkable at any hotel I've ever stayed in). Rooms Continued: 1) There is one towel rack in the entire room and it's in the shower. 2) the Light switches are so oddly hidden-it took 2 days to find the one for the shower. 3) The hanging lamp (which produces an annoying yellow glow) has NO on/off switch. To turn it off, I had to climb over an obstacle course of furniture and unplug it manually. A guest I spoke to wasn't as lucky. His lamp was hard-wired in and the only way to turn it off was to unscrew the bulb. 4) No turn down service. 5) The tub and the floor of the shower were NEVER cleaned. 6) Virtually no drawer space-One tiny drawer and one narrow drawer in each of the end tables. We kept our clothes in our luggage on a bench for our entire stay-and mind you-this was a huge room with plenty of space for chests of drawers. 7) The TV (which wasn't getting reception for 2 days), is placed on a stand in a cabinet at a 45 degree angle to the bed. (this is in ALL the rooms) You have to pull it out of the cabinet, swivel it and even then. it's difficult to watch. 8) Internet-not only slow and useless but you have to re-sign up for it every day. 9) No room for toiletries-just a narrow shelf above the bathroom sink. 10) $17 for each new pay-for-view movie. 11) CONDOMS AND LUBRICANTS next to the candy and snacks-it didn't really bother me, I just thought it to be amusing if not somewhat bizarre. However, if i had kids, I'd be really pissed off. Beach-the beach (except for the music of course) is nice but it is not properly staffed. You have to find your own umbrella-move your own chairs and there is no food service on the sand, even though the main outdoor bar is only a staircase away. Food-Crap. Nothing more to say about it-except perhaps that it was expensive crap. If you've never had Mofongo-PLEASE do not order it here. It will forever tarnish your perception of one of PR's great foods. The last indignity-we wanted to print out our boarding pass on our last day. They charge for the use of a printer! (By contrast-I was recently staying at the Murano in Paris -which is also a very pricey hotel, and when i was having computer problems-they actually gave me a computer to use for free for an entire week-THIS is the way to run a hotel.) Pros- 1)the staff does try really hard 2) It's really the only game in town. Now here I must mention that I am not against the hipster hotel format (if that is what the W is striving for) The Standard for instance does it perfectly. Everything about the W however, is totally off and while I suspect that they are trying in part to appeal to the same crowd, they fail on every level. And as a retreat? Not even close. The sad thing is that the staff does try hard to please but there is nothing they can do to compensate for a place that was clearly so ill-conceived from the start and so badly managed by people who continue to make bad decisions and refuse to correct problems that are easily remedied. And mind you-the staff has heard all of these complaints Management simply doesn't care to address and rectify them. Finally-a very expensive hotel that calls itself a "retreat", should be just that. At resorts that charge these kinds of prices (and frankly, much less expensive ones as well) the one quality you will always find, is that there is never a compelling reason to want to leave-you love the room and the service, the amenities and the grounds so much, that you have to be torn away to go to town or outside restaurants, other beaches, etc. The W does not have this quality. Here, you instead find yourself constantly compelled to get away from all the crap that I listed, driven out by bad food, noise, cold temperature,malfunctioning internet and TV etc, etc etc..... And IT'S TOO DARK TO READ A BLOODY BOOK!!!!! If you want to go to Vieques-rent a house. the bargains are great. The W is a pig with lipstick. Truthfully-anyone who thinks it's luxurious has probably not travelled very much.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever.

It's garbage.If you're looking for a massive, impersonal, noisy, down-at-the-heels hotel where you won't feel safe, the Royal National in London is the place for you. We booked our rooms at this unhappy place through a deal with British Airways. Traveling with my two teenage daughters, I called a week before our arrival to make sure that the two nights in a double room and one night in a single room that came free with our airfare could be upgraded to three nights in a triple room. No problem, I was told. An extra bed could be wheeled in for 17 additional pounds. But when we arrived it was a different story. The lobby was a madhouse, the staff at the desk were harried and rude, the hotel had no triples available and Vicki, the reception clerk who clearly wanted me to just go away, informed me that they did not in fact have beds that could be wheeled in to a double to make a triple. Instead, I had to book a single room for my older daughter for the first two nights. On the third night, I'd have to go find a double elsewhere, as the hotel was fully booked. Our rooms were a disappointment. The furniture was cheap and I'm guessing that it was at least two decades old, though in terms of style -- and I use that term generously -- it appeared to be from the '60s or '70s, which was also the approximate date of the built-in push-button panel next to one bed that controlled the TV and lights. No clock or radio in the room. A phone, but local calls were emphatically not free. The bedspreads were faded. There was an electric kettle in each room, and a packet containing a tea bag, beverage whitener (yes, that's what it said) and instant coffee. In the single, the electric kettle was filthy, there was a damp towel in the tub, and an accumulation of dust and hair behind the sliding bathroom door. The curtains in both rooms didn't close completely, and had to be held in place by propping the desk chair against the window sill. The double room (6106) had a view of the offices and classrooms of the University College of London across the street and the homeless people who slept on the sidewalks at the base of the building. The single room (6108) had a view of the gigantic courtyard of the hotel, and even with the window shut and a chair holding the curtains in place, it was extremely noisy at all times, with an endless parade of vehicles, tour guides shouting out instructions to their groups, young adults yelling to one another, pub goers returning in the wee hours of the morning, and tour buses beeping as they backed in at 5 a.m. to pick up people who were going out to the airport for an early flight. Each room had just one towel in it (not counting the dirty one thathad been left in the single room). When I asked for additional towels I was instructed to go to the first floor, find the housekeeping office, and see what they could do for me. I did so, signed for the additional towels, and returned the dirty one at the same time. Our "free" hotel rooms were clearly not a very good deal. But things got worse: at 3:30 a.m. we were literally jolted out of our beds by an extremely loud fire alarm. While ordinarily this might have been merely inconvenient, two bombs had been found in London that week, the country was on high security alert, and as I and my two children were herded down six flights of stairs with hundreds of other guests we were terrified and wondering if we were a target. At the bottom of the stairs we found ourselves in a small, fenced-off parking lot, held in close to the building by an eight-foot chain-link gate. After about five minutes a staff member came and unlocked the gate, so we could go to the assembly area near the courtyard. Eventually we were allowed to climb the stairs back to our rooms.... ...only to have the fire alarm go off a second time shortly after five. We left the hotel again, this time taking a different fire exit so we wouldn't feel trapped in the fenced-in parking area. When we talked about this experience the next morning, we discovered that as we moved briskly down the stairs the three of us were thinking some of the same things. Was there a bomb in the hotel? a fire? When we got to the bottom of the steps, what would we find? Is this the smartest thing to be doing, to be carried along by this massive crowd? Is this happening at other hotels too, to distract emergency services while something truely horrible happens somewhere else? We felt very vulnerable. Shortly after we arrived in the hotel's courtyard the crowd suddenly panicked, and ran out into the street. We followed suit, not running but walking quickly and staying out of the main press of people. I positioned us behind a stairway on the building across the street, not far from where a homeless person was sleeping, oblivious to the thousands of swarming people. The fire alarms were probably just a prank, and certainly weren't the hotel's fault, but they did nothing to enhance our sense of security at the Royal National. And there was no acknowledgement that this might have been inconvenient or unpleasant for the guests. No regrets, no apology. We slept in in the morning, and barely made it to breakfast on time. At breakfast I decided that the Royal National doesn't cater to guests, it processes them. Breakfast was held in a huge, huge room full of tippy tables pushed very close together. The buffet for the full, cooked breakfast, to which my older daughter was entitled, through the single room we'd purchased for her, was on one side, and was closely guarded by staff, who checked tickets and ordered you away if you were only entitled to a continental breakfast. My younger daughter and I were in no mood for meat and eggs anyway, so we ate a lot of toast with butter and jam and drank some orange juice. We had been looking forward to a nice cup of tea, having developed a real fondness for it, but at the Royal National the tea comes from a gigantic urn, which I suspect has never been rinsed out. It was a profound disappointment. Four nice things about the Royal National: 1. We were able to use our little Mac Book in the lobby, thanks to their wireless internet service. 2. We could pick up a free newspaper in the morning in the lobby. 3. The location is pretty good, close to Russel Square, the tube station and the British Museum. 4. At breakfast they give you real milk to put on your stale cereal or in your undrinkable tea, which is a big step up from beverage whitener. It was wonderful to move to a small, quiet private hotel in Cartwright Gardens for the remainder of our time in London. I and my loved ones will never again stay at the Royal National, or any of the properties belonging to Imperial London Hotels.Flees, bed bug residue, mildew smells.....This is probably one of worst hotel that I have ever stayed in, and paid so much for! My brother-in-law booked this hotel for $140 per night, as we needed a place to stay prior to our cruise, and most hotels with better reviews were fully booked. I was somewhat concerned, but given that the SuperBowl was approaching, and most hotels were fully booked, we didn't really have much of a choice. One other factor that aided in our decision making was that the hotel provided free breakfast, and transportation to the port, which would be a great saving considering we were traveling as a group. First of all, I'll start with the airport shuttle which arrived shortly after we exited the terminal. The driver informed us that the luggage storage to the exterior of the bus was not operational, and so we had to load all of our luggage onto the bus itself. This was surely a safety hazard as we (all other passengers incl my family) would not be able to the bus in an emergency due to the amount of luggage blocking the exit. The driver did not seem concerned and thankfully the ride took a short time i.e. all of about 10 minutes. When we arrived at the hotel, the check in process was a nightmare. Let me explain... there were two people at the desk and a lot of people arriving. The employees at the desk were dealing with multiple phone calls, and departing guests, who understanably did not want to wait in line - with the sheer number of guests arriving - to seek assistance. After about 30 minutes we were checked into our rooms. I looked around the hotel lobby, and was at this point beginning to develop concern over the potential state of the rooms. I went to grab a cup of complimentary coffee, and was greeted by a table with dirty cups, a very stained table cloth, and three coffee pots that were either cold or empty. Next we scheduled the morning transportation to the port, and were informed by the front desk that we would be called in the morning close to the departure time. We were assigned rooms in the second building toward the rear of the hotel. Unfortunately, during the check-in process my husband had developed an allergic reaction to his sickness patch, and so we asked reception to provide information on the local hospital. We were checked in and assigned rooms in the second building. To get to the second building you need to walk past the lobby, dining and pool area. Once we got into the building the mildew smell immediately hit us, in addition to the state of the floors, walls, and the obvious lack of maintenance. Because of the urgency, we put our bags in the room, and called the local hospital. As I put the paper down by the counter to write the details of the hospital, I was shocked to find it covered in flees. I called my family and immediately told them to remove any luggage from the floors, and to set everything on the suitcase stand provided. During the call my husband noticed that the second bed in our room was not made up completely and was showing the box spring and mattress. I walked over to the mattress to see what the large black/reddish area was on the mattress, and low and behold it was COVERED in bed bug fecal matter, and dead bed bugs. Thankfully, we did not have our luggage on the beds per the guidance of my family, as this pest can be carried from one place to another in luggage and on clothing. My mother-in-law said that the only way she could sleep in her room was with the assistance of Tylenol PM. My husband and I stayed at the hospital for most of the night while my husband was treated, and as I mentioned the hotel to the Dr, he mentioned that he had heard really bad things about the hotel,and even offered us a single bed for the night! Thankfully, my husband was okay, but we were both dreading returning to the hotel. Once we arrived at the hotel, we sat outside by the pool until we just couldn't stay up any longer i.e. around 5 a.m. where I was surprised to find several other guests who couldn't sleep in their rooms for various reasons including bed begs, smells, and broken air conditioners. When we did return to the room we slept in our clothes, on top of the top sheet. Yes, the sheet you should typically remove as it doesn't get washed!! As soon as I woke up the next morning, Iliterally left the room within minutes. I didn't take a shower, brush my teeth or do anything, and quite frankly I wouldn't risk it for fear of picking up something. I had brush-ups and we brushed our teeth outside the hotel. The next morning (thankfully time to check out) we were met in the lobby but a sea of guests all trying to cram into the breakfast area. The breakfast i.e. a bagel, or Danish (single wrapped), and tea or coffee wasn't impressive at all, but we were just grateful to be leaving the hotelâ€¦ so we thought........ The line outside for the port transportation was long, and people were accumulating quickly. When the first bus arrived the hotel personnel were quietly saying the names of guests, and so many didn't even realize they were supposed to be on the shuttle to the port. People without their names on the list we being allowed onto the bus, and as a result the crowd became somewhat disorderly with people shouting and screaming at each other and hotel staff. Of course, the fact that the luggage area was broken did not help. When we did finally get on the shuttle (approximately 1 hour later) I was asked if I would mind sitting on my husband's lap. My sister-in-law was also asked to sit on her husband's lap. I asked the driver how we would exit in an emergency, and he joked about it. Thankfully, I noticed that the back window is an emergency exit. With that we left, NEVER to see the Red Roof Inn againâ€¦ Sorry, I chose not to take photo's of this hotel as it was just too bad, and I didn't need the visual reminder.My husband and I stayed 2 nights in this hotel. It started badly with the taxi driver dumping us and our luggage on first street. My husband left me on the sidewalk with the luggage to get someone to help us with our stuff. He returned with a luggage cart. The guys inside had told him they could not come down to the corner of the street, but had given him the cart - something they weren't allowed to, but did anyways. So we pushed our luggage up the sidewalk to the hotel, where the guys took over. Great! We checked in with a guy who was not overjoyed to see us. He told us he had upgraded us to a superior corner room with the best view, non-smoking. My husband had forgotten to add non-smoking when he booked the hotel (there was no button there, you need to add this in your comment it seems) so he emailed twice asking them to mark our room non-smoking with no reply from them. It sounded nice to be upgraded, so we were cheery. We had also requested a room as high as possible which we did not get. We were still in the lower floors, though it was high enough in the end. Just not what we had specifically asked for. We then went to the elevator and got upstairs. The hallways wiped the cheery smiles off our faces quickly. There was red tape all over the floor, where the brownish carpet had been ripped. We were all the way down the hall and entered our room which was very hot. We turned the AC to its coldest and it did send out cool air, but the window shades had been up all day, so the sun had heated the room up to over 80 degrees - despite the AC. We lowered the shades right away, which helped a little. The view really was pretty good, though to see Empire State Building and Chrysler Building we had to almost lean out of the window - which was impossible, because the window does not open. We had chosen that hotel especially because we saw that you could open the window. It didn't matter much, but, the windows were really dirty, both from in- and outside. I went to the bathroom and was shocked by the state of the bathroom! The sink was sitting inside a glass surrounding, but that was totally cracked! I always feared it would fall apart while I was in there. The big mirror next to the toilet was dirty and chipped on the upper part. The floor tiles were chipped or cracked - at least 50% of them were not in one piece anymore. It didn't happen to us, but on those chipped tiles you can easily cut your foot open when you walk with bare feet. The walls were heavily stained, even some browning liquid had trickled down the wall in one place. Not a big thing, but still: ICKY! Don't wanna know what that was. My husband took a shower - only to bathe his feet almost up to his knees because the drain worked so poorly. The bathroom had no working fan/ vent. For the 2 of us there was only 1 washcloth in total. I called housekeeping and they told me it would take them 10 - 15 minutes at least to bring some up. 20 minutes later I had 3 extra wash clothes. (Not the newest, but they seemed clean.) There is a high headboard above the bed and there was a big thing of dust looking down at me when I was in bed. I was not very happy with the room, so I got out our reservation and found out we had not been upgraded at all! The room we were in was exactly what we had booked and paid for - only thing was non-smoking and that can hardly be an upgrade! In the morning, it got really hot again, even though the shades had been down straight away. I went to complain to the front desk. The lady there never even said she was sorry. I had written a long list of things we didn't find alright and by the time I had gotten to number 3 she wasn't even listening to me. She asked me to leave the list with her to give to the housekeeping manager. That apparently did happen, because the stains had been cleared off the bathroom walls and the windows had been cleaned from the inside. The plug in the tub had been replaced. Of course, the tiles, the mirror and the sink would have needed big time construction and that we would not have liked within our 2 night stay. The dust was also still looking at me. The tip we had left in the hope to get a cleaner room was left untouched. So, all in all there was some improvement, but it was not what we had expected, wanted or had to pay for. My husband checked out and told the next guy at the front desk about all our complaints again. The guy said he was sorry for our inconvenience and said all he could do with the room rate was not charge the internet we had used on one of our 2 days. So that was a big disappointment in the end. The only person who managed to get a tiny smile on our face was Ozzy, because he was really nice and treated us as we would have expected by any one of those people in the hotel. As guests and the people who pay their salary.My wife and I have stayed at several downtown Toronto hotels, although this was the first time here at 1 King West. I booked the room over a month ahead of time by phoning the hotel for a one night stay. We were headed into Toronto for a concert at the Air Canada Centre. At the time of booking the hotel (1 month ahead), I made 2 simple requests - a King Size bed and a car ride through their complementary car service. I was told that most beds were Kings in the hotel and they would put a note on my reservation requesting such a bed. I was offered a Tower Superior Room for $239, which was supposed to be one of the better rooms according to the hotel. I booked the car service with the valet, who told me the date and time was open and inked me in. The Good: Well, it's hard to pin-point the good when the Bad and Ugly just cloud everything, but I'll try. Location: King and Yonge right in the downtown core. Close to shopping, restaurants, and connects to the PATH (Toronto's underground downtown walkway). Subway stop is just outside the hotel. Rooms: The room has a mini-fridge, washer, dryer, microwave, dishwasher, plates, silverware, DVD player, in-room safe. Kind of nice if staying for an extended period. Appliances were kind of awkwardly put into the kitchenette (washer and dryer are in the cabinets in your kitchenette, fridge sits atop your counter) but I guess that's the only way to fit it in the limited room space. Beds were comfortable and bathroom was average sized for a 5-star. Overall, the room was good...not 5-star comparable to most other downtown TO hotels, but better than your average 3 or 4 star hotel room. Complementary car service to downtown locations on a first-come-first-serve basis (booking with valet required). The Bad: Not to be nit-picky, but the room was somewhat run down. For a relatively "new" Toronto hotel, every corner had missing paint chips, scuff marks, etc. I can certainly see the need for a little maintenance and house-keeping over the regular sweep-and-vaccuum. The parking in front of the hotel is non-existent when checking-in/pulling up. The traffic is heavy and there is no room to pull into the hotel (the few spots the hotel has house the complementary car service limos). You end up pulling along the street and the valets come out to greet you across the street. Poor design for sure. Valet Parking by the way costs $30 per day, which is a little steep even by downtown Toronto standards. There is no hotel self park, although lots in the area charge approx $20/day. The Ugly: A couple of points are specific to our experience, but after reading a few other similar reviews here, I can see a pattern of apathy and nonsensical logic on the staff's part. Like I mentioned, I booked a month ahead of time and made a request for a king bed. We have one at home...we are used to the size and we are not the smallest people in the world. Well, of couse when checking in, we are told that our room has a queen bed. When I mentioned that I had requested a king, I was told that there were no Tower Superior Rooms available with a king bed. This was at 3:10pm when check in was 3:00. I then asked if they had any other room that had a king bed open. Was told that there were standard suites with kings available. The standard suites were a downgrade in room type and size, however we were willing to take if for the king bed. Remember, I paid $239 for my room and the standard suite normally goes for $169. I was willing to switch rooms and pay the $239 rate even with room downgrade. However, I was told that because rooms were so full that day in Toronto, the rate for the standard suite was now $350! So, basically they wanted me to take a downgrade and pay an extra $111 on top of it. Ridiculous! Next, when confirming my ride, I was told that there were other people also going to the concert and they wanted to cram everyone in one vehicle. Well, so much for their first-come, first serve policy. The point of riding in the classic car was to have a romantic ride to the event, not be packed like sardines in a '56 Cadillac. Finally, I mentioned the room needed a little repair and maintenance. The maid also needed to learn how to clean. There was filth on the kitchen counter under the fridge (hair, food, who knows what else). There was an unmentionable stain in the bath tub and the light switches were covered in filth (see photos). Overall, if you are staying for a holiday, vacation, or special occasion, I would HIGHLY recommend you stay elsewhere. The business traveler may find this hotel useful if you can get over the obvious deficiencies. Don't expect the staff/management to do anything if you voice your concerns...they don't even have comment cards. There are many quality hotels in downtown Toronto...this is definitely NOT one of them.Let me start by saying that I travel frequently on business, and have for well over 20 years. I ended up staying here last week because I failed to account for the NYC Christmas crowds, and was unable to get a room at one of the places at which I usually stay. Every negative review you read here is 100% right on! Anything positive you read here is inaccurate and misleading. (I must note though that the hotel staff themselves were all friendly and tried their best to be accomodating. They simply don't have much to work with here.) The simple fact is that this hotel should not be allowed to operate as is. I have stayed in many, many different places all over the world, and have never experienced anything as bad as this. Like a couple of the other reviewers, I too merely needed a place to sleep, and wasn't overly concerned about the lack of amenities. (The last I heard however, "cleanliness" and "sanitary" weren't considered "amenities".) There are far too many things wrong with this place to list, but I'll try. It is unclean - and I mean everything. The entrance, lobby (if you can call it that), the shoebox sized elevator, the hallways, the room (and every single thing in it), and the bathroom. The sheets were threadbare and did not appear or smell clean, there were clumps of hair on the pillows which certainly weren't mine. (It was to the point that I wondered if they rented these rooms out by the hour during the day, when most of the patrons were either working or out sightseeing.) The walls and ceiling were badly stained. The carpeting almost defies description - filthy indoor/outdoor carpeting, which kind of "crackled" when you walked on it, and which was cut out around the bed and dresser, as though whoever put it in was too lazy to move the furniture first. The mattress was as hard as a rock, and also provided that lovely "crackling" sound when you sat in it. (My therapist has advised me that it would be in my best interest to try to forget the details of the "comforter" on top of the bed.) The bathroom lterally had piles of debris/hair/ etc... in each corner. I wanted to wear my shoes in the tub, never mind even considering taking a bath in it. No shampoo was provided of course. I am thankful that it wasn't summertime, because I have no doubt that the place would be chock full of bugs, cockroaches, and who knows what else. I had to scrub the dresser drawers before I put my clothing in them. I lined them with plastic bags as well. Let's see, none of the windows were openable, there were noisy, inconsiderate people coming and going all night long - up and down the 5 foot wide hallways, making no effort whatsoever to try to be quiet. The neighborhood, although not the best/safest, and certainly not what you are led to expect (by hotels or Expedia) by any stretch of the imagination, wasn't terrible, and was convenient to Times Square and the Theater District. The TV got about 20 channels - of these, 3 were in Spanish, 3 were Oriental, and most of the balance didn't come in well enough to either watch or listen to. From the outside, this hotel bears absolutely no resemblance to the picturesque little brownstone you see on the Internet. It is a squat, drab little place, with the word "Hotel" handwritten on the back of a sheet of printer paper, taped to the door. (There were some sort of dead, skinned fowl (I think they were ducks) hanging in the window immediately to the left of the entrance. There is also apparently a place very nearby that has been rented to a fledgling rock band (and trust me, they are very early on in their careers), which is used for their nightly practice session, which thankfully seemed to wrap up at about 10:30 PM. It is also billed as an "Internet Cafe". This portion of their business consisted of two computers on TV trays (or something similar) in the already crowded lobby. I didn't see anything that would render the term "Cafe" an appropriate name for the business. When I returned home, I washed everything, whether I had worn it or not, and brought my suits and ties to the dry cleaners. (I neglected to mention that there wasn't a closet in my room - I was forced to hang all of my clothes on the wall-mounted clothes rod, for all the world to see while the maid was "cleaning??" my room.) I should also mention that this is the second room I had here - I was in the first one for about 30 seconds before I was on the (dirty, sticky) phone calling the front desk insisting on a different room. They were equally disgusting, but at least in the second room, I was able to get into the bathroom without the need to sandwich myself against the filthy wall and slide sideways into it. (I am not a big person either - 5'8" and 155 lbs). As for climate controls - there was no lack of heat, in fact there was no controlling the heat. It was stifling all night long. I peeled off the "comforter" and "blanket" and just slept with the dirty sheet. (Even now I shudder at the recollection.) I am most surprised that this was listed as a halfway decent place on Hotels. In fact, the only reason I remained here was due to the fact that as I had booked the room on hotels, I had already paid for it. I sensed that if I mentioned anything about a refund to the person at the front desk, I would have been laughed out into the street. (Which in itself would have been an upgrade.) The room was not inexpensive - $109/night for the first few nights and then $149/night for the final night. The bottom line is that people should not be expected to shell out that kind of money and then end up in a place like this. If this is the new baseline for price/value in NYC, then shame on the hotel industry. My advice would be to either plan your trip well in advance, and you absolutely can get a decent room in this price range (or even for slightly less) in the city, albeit with a little advance planning; or as an alternative, simply budget a little more for this expense. If you can't afford to spend a little more, you would be well-advised to postpone your trip untilyou can. As for me, I will never, ever stay here again!I recently got married at the Riu Palace Mexico. During my stay there my group and I were treated very poorly and unfairly and my wedding day was basically ruined. Our wedding coordinator at the resort was very reluctant to work with me on anything from the beginning. I had trouble dealing with her even before we got to Mexico. The resort as a whole was simply unable to cater to our large group of 59 people. We were told only a few weeks before the wedding that groups of 27 or more people would have to eat dinner at the late seating which was at 8:45pm. This wouldn't have been a problem except for the fact that we were going to spend $1300 extra dollars to rent out the disco for a reception. They also told us we could spend $700 more dollars to rent out one of the restaurants, but that all 59 people in our party would have to eat the same one dish that we chose for them. In a group of 60, its just about impossible to assume everyone will be able to eat either beef, chicken or fish. We were also told that if we wanted cocktails at the reception, it would cost an extra $9 per person (even though everyone had already paid for alcohol in their all-inclusive resort package). Between all the money we were spending on the Caprice package (the most expensive wedding package), the fact that we were bringing 60 people to their resort during an off season, and knowing that it was an all-inclusive resort, we really felt like they should have been able to work with us on some of these costs. Of course, tropical storm Ida decided she wanted to join us they day of the wedding, so it needed to be moved inside. Understanding that this was in no way the resort's fault, we just tried to stay positive when we were told the ceremony would need to be held in the resort's theater. Prior to this, several people in our group had actually witnessed a wedding in the resort's lobby the day before and said it was very nice, so we were optimistic. When I asked if we could have our ceremony in the lobby instead like the other couple, we were told "Oh, those people paid a lot of extra money to have their ceremony in the lobby." REALLY? They paid more to have it in the LOBBY??? How come I didn't see that in the list of add-ons? How come that option was never even mentioned to me, I had to bring it up? And then when I did, suddenly there would be another expense? Why would it possibly cost more to have the service in the lobby versus the theater? It wasn't going to cost the resort any more. But honestly, I was just too exhausted to fight with her anymore at that point, so I just gave in, thinking the theater might be better than I was imagining. But no, the theater was atrocious. All they did was add an arch and, other than that, it was just the theater. I walked down an aisle formed out of pink velvet theater chairs!!! An aisle so thin that my father and I could barely fit down it. My dress kept hitting those horrible velvet chairs to the point where we almost fell over. My photos are hideous because I was surrounded by a sea of pink velvet chairs, lace curtains, horrible pink patterned carpet and ceiling fans!! We actually downgraded our photo package after-the-fact because there were only a handful that were actually any good. Not to mention we didn't hear a word from our coordinator or anyone else on the wedding staff the second after the ceremony started. No one checked in to see if everything went ok. No one tried to contact us to follow up and see if we were happy with the ceremony or if there was anything else they could do to help. I was simply appalled at the lack of customer service we received the entire time we were dealing with the resort. Oh, but we're not done. Outside of just the wedding issues we had, we were also unable to make reservations at any of the specialty restaurants, except for the Brazilian steakhouse. For as large as the resort is, only 2 of the 4 specialty restaurants are open every night (again, showing they are unable, or just unwilling, to cater to the large amount of people who were staying there, even in an off month). And I'd be surprised if each restaurant had more than 50 seats. And in order to try and secure one of these precious seats, you had to get up at 7am to make sure you were one of the first 50 people in line at 8am when the reservations table opened up, in hopes you could get in. Oh, and if it was any time after 10:30am, the reservations table was closed and there was no way to make a reservation anywhere, even at the Brazilian restaurant. Maybe this is the way all of the resorts in Playa del Carmen do things, but I've been to very nice resorts in both Cancun and Puerta Vallarta and NEVER had to deal with so many rules and limitations. And to top it all off, at least half of my guests, including myself, went home with bronchitis and sinus infections - almost positively due to the poor ventilation systems in the rooms. Several of my guests actually asked to have their rooms switched the first day they arrived because of leaks in the roofs and musty odors. For a resort that claims to be five star, you certainly could have fooled us. And, some of our guests/groomsmen also almost slipped and fell while walking down the aisle and when members of the wedding party informed the coordinator that the floor was slippery and wet she simply wiped it up with a piece of paper and proceeded to toss that trash onto a nearby table in what was supposed to be my beautiful wedding room. Appalled by this, one of the groomsmen actually had to throw the paper away or she would of just left it there. Also, while myself and my bridesmaids were getting ready for the wedding in one of our rooms, we requested a bottle of champagne that we never received and had to trudge down to the lobby bar to get drinks for all 5 girls in the wedding party plus my mother and grandmother, and when we requested help back to the room with them, so not to spill them, we were rudely told no by the wait staff so I had to get my cousin to come help us. The worst part is, I only get to have a wedding once... and my day was ruined. I just really expected the resort to take more care with such a special day. So now, I just want to make sure no other bride as to go through what I did. The Riu is NOT the place to stay in Mexico, no matter the reason you are visiting. STAY AWAY FROM RIU RESORTS!>This hotel could be wonderful but the service is terrible and the desk staff is rude when there is a legitimate issue. It is a shame because this hotel does have great amenities. Off the lobby there are shops and a restaurant which thankfully are not managed by the same people as the hotel. The hotel itself is older but seems well kept and the parking garage is a great asset in L.A. However the absent communication between the desk and housekeeping equates to dirty rooms and violations of guests peace and privacy. Worse, when these deficiencies are pointed out the staff responds with rude behavior or empty promises. My experience with this hotel began well and then went down hill. Unhappy with the location of the original hotel I had booked I called Choice Hotels for an alternate location and found this hotel. Unfortunately they were not able to complete the reservation because their computers were down and my WiFi was not working so Choice gave me the number and I called the hotel directly. The young lady who answered was very pleasant and I booked a room. Upon arrival I found a very well appointed older hotel and was pleased with the value and the service of the young lady I had spoken with who was at the desk. The service made me smile and look forward to a pleasant stay. That is until walking into the room. The door was ajar when I arrived and it became apparent the housekeeping had not completed their tasks. Pillows were missing from the bed, the linens had not all been replaced, and the room had not been vacuumed. Later I found the refrigerator had a spill which was leaking out. Seeing the condition of the room I called the desk for another but they encouraged me to stay in the room when I asked to do it later because I was running tight for an appointment and needed to take a shower and change. They offered instead to send housekeeping if I called when ready . It seems the desk never contacted housekeeping because as I stepped wearing only a towel into dressing area the housekeeper came in to the great embarrassment of both of us. She hurriedly dropped a few towels and left. While I understand her angst she never returned to finish cleaning though I again called the desk and they apologized and said the room would be made and the Manager would call me the next morning. I came back late that evening to find the room in the same state. By then food and liquid left in the fridge had begun to seep out and I used the few towels I had left. The air conditioning had been off so there was an odor. I called the desk and again they would not offer another room, nor would they provide pillows or towels and the desk clerk was very rude. He said if I did not like the room they had a "satisfaction guaranteed policy" and the manager would refund in the morning. Notably this never happened The stench in the room was unbearable so I cleaned the mess they should have then opened the window and turned the air conditioning on to ventilate and cool the room and went out so it could air. As I passed the desk the clerk was in an animated conversation with another man using colorful language. Later I returned to my room and called down for a wake up call and a late check out. No wake up call came and I missed breakfast. I woke because housekeeping walked in again though there was a Do Not Disturb on the door. The clerk had not put in my late check out. I called the desk to complain again and and had a difficult time getting a late checkout though it is a benefit of the the rewards program I belong to with the chain. They did finally give me the late checkout. Though polite at this time, and though they did acknowledge the legitimacy and seriousness of my complaint the staff said they could do nothing to assist me and I needed to talk to the manager who was off property. Later I found this was not true. I asked for housekeeping to clean my room when I went out to eat and they refused saying I was checking out that day. Apparently clean rooms are not part of staying at this hotel. After an early lunch I finally found the General Manager. He was very polite gentleman from Korea I believe and shared a few nice stories about his homeland. He said how embarrassed he was about the terrible service, though in retrospect he seemed more concerned about an unauthorized person being behind his register with the night clerk than my problems. I explained how the clerk had said rather than deal with my problem I could ask for a refund but what I had wanted was the room clean and right not the money. He did offer to refund the room but suggested as it was a business stay and really did not benefit me, he offered a return stay. He was so gracious I honestly I felt this service was an anomaly and accepted his offer. \The reason I accepted is the hotel is in a great location and the attached Japanese restaurant is outstanding. I ate there three times and enjoyed every meal and the extraordinarily good service. Sorry I cannot recall the name but if you do take the trouble to find it, try the lunch special. It mixes tempura sushi and sashimi and while not cheap is great food at a great value. There is also an unusual store there in the form of a quaint mountaineering and sportswear store. They staff there is very friendly and knowledgeable. I really enjoyed it and bought a few things. >When I left I felt my visit had been a trial but fairly good about the hotel because of the graciousness of the Manager. It seemed that he would make it irght. However it was a placebo, and apparently not an effort to do the right thing. A week or two later I called seeking to give them another chance as the Manager had requested and offered. As a matter of fact I was optimistic I attempted to book a weekend which would have resulted in two paid days in addition to the one he offered. The staff was very rude. Desk Managers represented themselves as the General Manager. One woman I spoke with said yes she was aware of the problem and would offer me a minor discount off of rack rate which amounted to significantly more then either my AAA or Choice Privileges would provide me.I called Choice Hotels and they offered me a contact and finally a transfer took me to to the business office only to miss the GM. I did reach the accountant who was a nice guy and promised to give my number of the General Manager. No one called. Had I booked through Choice I would have a recourse. Unfortunately I was not able to. Needless to say I would not recommend this hotel. > > --------------------- >After hearing many great reviews about Venetian, me and my friends decided to give it a try! We traveled with a party of 5 girls for a stagette and stayed from a Friday to Monday. We requested for adjoining rooms at time of booking, and knowing that it’s only a “request” so I called the day before arrival to confirm availability, and was told that we would for sure be getting 2 adjoining rooms and the friendly staff provided me with a confirmation number. We checked in the hotel at around 10 pm on the Friday, and the girl at front desk told us that we weren’t getting adjoining rooms as they usually cost extra and they were all booked up, however, she could “upgrade” us to the Palazzo Tower at a discounted rate of $40-$45 extra per night per room for the adjoining request. We refused to pay extra for something that we were told that was confirmed already, but the girl didn't acknowledge it and never apologized for the misleading information the hotel had provided in the first place, and said the best she could do was to put the two rooms on the same floor, and as she was speaking to us, she was printing out the room cards already when we hadn’t even reached to an agreement. Me and all my friends were all frustrated and tired from our flight, and we told her that we would not be staying at Venetian for our trip if we weren’t given what we had requested (and confirmed on), and another front desk person beside the girl overheard our conversations and pointed at the computer to the girl and said "These adjoining rooms just opened a moment ago- you can put them there", and honestly I don’t even know if they actually had openings and just didn’t want to give them to us because they wanted us to pay extra for the upgrade, but then the approach that the girl was using was just so wrong - she could have just given us the option but not having to force us. Overall, very not impressed with the attitude from the front desk girl that was assisting us that night. We were put in the Venetia Tower (which is a far walk from the lobby, and probably the most dated tower out of the three) and on the 4th floor with a view overlooking a parking lot. The room that I was staying in was fine, but the other room that my friends were staying had nothing that was functioning– none of the electric outlets were working, and the phone and the safe didn’t work either – we placed a service call, and someone came take the phone away to fix it but we never got the phone back., so during the whole trip the 5 of us shared the safe, and they had to come over to our room to use the phone, hair dryer, etc. As for the housekeeping, on the first day the housekeeper didn't replace any of the shampoo/conditioner/lotion, nor any of the wine glasses and cups that were used, and on the second day, both rooms didn’t even get a housekeeping at all!! We called the front desk when we got back to the hotel room around 10 pm on Sunday, and was told that they’d send someone up in 20 minutes, and an hour passed no one showed up, so my friend called again only to find out that they said there was no record of us calling the first place. So we waited again for a while, and still no signs of housekeeping, then we called AGAIN and guess what they told us!? They said that all the housekeepers were busy getting ready for guests that were arriving the next morning so they won't be able to send anyone - but shouldn't they put the GUESTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE HOTEL a priority?! and we really didn’t appreciate the fact that if they were never going to send someone up, just tell us that in the first place, but we had to find that out after 3 calls and couple hours had passed. We ran out of towels that night and were all waiting for the housekeeper to come so we could shower but it never happened so they just sent some extra towels. During the stay, we also called the front desk for a hot water dispenser and it was around $5.00 I believe, and took more than an hour for it to arrive. We called front desk on Monday morning to make a complaint about our overall experience of the stay, and they offered us either a late check out time or a $25 food credit towards each room, which was a total insult. We negotiated and got more food credit towards each room and a late check out but overall, still not impressed with the experience at all and the solution the hotel had offered. Me and my friends have traveled in Vegas many times in the past, and this had to be the worst hotel experience ever. We all were very excited about the trip but the hotel just sort of had it ruined. We will not stay there again and will not recommend to any friends/family.I chose the Occidental Grand Xcaret resort in Mexico after reading so many positive reviews. Unfortunately, I chose to ignore the negatives. At first I was quite pleased – the hotel room was as advertised and although some people complained that the beds were hard and the room’s dark, I certainly had no complaints (apart from the curtains hanging down in the middle and on the right hand side). Shortly after arrival, however, we awoke to no running water and no electricity. This happened several times during our stay. Otherwise, everything was going quite well, and we had a reservation for the Mexican restaurant shortly after our arrival. That night everything changed. I was awoken in the early hours by excruciating stomach cramps, and minutes later, severe diarrhoea. I also had a temperature and felt wretched. During the remaining two weeks of our vacation I tried everything from starvation diets, to Imodium and Pepto Bismol. During this time I rang reception and after explaining that I had a stomach upset asked if I could order some bland food such as boiled rice, but was told I could not have room service. Believing that I had been misunderstood, I re-explained my predicament but was told I could only have what was on the menu even though in reception there was a sign stating that special dietary requirements should be passed to reception. Obviously, if you are ill, you are on your own. I tried to order some plain boiled rice but the Buffet restaurant manager just offered flavoured wild rice with chicken. Needless to say, the chronic diarrhoea continued. Next I visited the onsite doctor. He just directed me to the tobacco shop in the resort to buy further medicine. I would also like to point out that at the beach club restaurant flies were allowed to settle on the food, especially the meat, and the Pepsi in the soda machine was discoloured (I have a photo which clearly shows the discrepancies between the Pepsi in the machine and the Pepsi from the bar). As I had no choice but to remain close to restrooms at all times, we were not able to take advantage of any of the trips we would have liked to and had been incresed by 20% during the Easter period. We did attempt Xcaret park next door but had to ‘race back’ after only a couple of hours. We also took a trip to Chichen Itza but had no option but to book the most expensive tour on offer as it was the only one (apparently) with an onboard toilet. Food was very mediocre in the buffet areas. – and always the same, no variety. The drinks served at the bars were in cracked and chipped plastic glasses. No straws available for frozen drinks – outfits ruined as you end up wearing your drink. No bicycle hire available – although advertised on website as inclusive My son was bitten by a scorpion on an organised trip, but received no first aid until we returned to hotel, and where I paid to see doctor. The swimming pools were warm and had slime patches floating on the surface. Car hire was $70 per day (compared to £25 per day if booked in UK). The trip to Chichen Itza was not as advertised. Firstly, it took 3 ½ hours to reach our destination, not 2½ as quoted by the booking agent. Breakfast was a ham and cheese roll and some orange juice – no other choice was given. Once at Chichen Itza the guide raced off and began giving his commentary before everyone reached him. There was no time to take photos. He then pointed us in the direction of the ‘observatory’ and headed back to the coach. We did not get to see the sacred cenote (was not even pointed out) although we were given confusing maps and allowed 40 minutes to have a look around on our own. This time went very quickly as my son had now also contracted an upset stomach and had to return several times to the main plaza to use the toilets. The remainder of the trip held little comparison to the hotel description and when I reported this to the booking office, but she was totally disinterested. I found that a lot at the resort, once they have your money they don’t want to know. Before leaving England I was told by First Choice that “we can no longer accept payment for any excursions or extras in resort in US Dollars while you’re in Mexico” but once at the resort EVERYTHING was in US DOLLARS – staff then used the hotel exchange rate to convert to Mexican Peso’s. I worked out that I was being charged at least 15% more to pay in Peso’s. I was told I could use a credit card but they would then add another 4% to the total. Mexico was a beautiful country and the people seemed genuinely friendly (so long as you tipped them) but our whole experience turned it into a trip from hell. I do not feel my condition was taken seriously and I was left to fend for myself. There were no activities for teenagers. The tennis courts and mini golf were only open during the hottest part of the day and even though we booked both during our visit, could only play for a few minutes due to the intense heat, my continuing diarrhoea and lack of shade. We did manage the ‘shooting’ activity but everyone was only allowed three shots each, even though no one else was waiting and the half an hour activity was not due to finish for another 15 minutes. I was told at the resort that if you wanted to do any snorkelling in the sea you would need flippers as well as a snorkel and if you did not have both you would have to purchase some (at the over inflated hotel price) or you would not be allowed to take part. There was no option to hire, even though they had spares. The lifeguard who was taking people out said all the extra pairs of flippers were his and no one was allowed to us them. Although I reported our problems to the Front Desk, Holiday Rep., Trip Booking Agents, on site Doctor and Restaurant Manager, the most positive response was “Oh, dear, that’s not good, is it?” Everyone else just ‘brushed it under the table’. This was meant to be our holiday of a lifetime. We were really looking forward to seeing all the incredible sights and snorkelling in the reefs. Instead, we spent two weeks trapped at the resort and surviving on bread and water.My friend and I have just returned from visiting Rome for the first time and I dare say it could be the last. Having paid £160 for 3 nights in a twin room we weren't expecting too much and boy were we right !! We arrived at the San Giusto hotel at 1.00pm exhausted having been travelling since 5.00am and were very anxious to get checked into our room. We were greeted with a luke warm reception (not even a hello, welkommen or a bonjour) only to discover that we had been allocated a double room, as opposed to the twin room we had booked and paid for, well in advance. After going back to the reception and explaining this, we were begrudgingly given a twin room on the 3rd floor. We had to carry our own cases up two flights of stairs to the first floor where the lift was located (a bizarre set up if ever I saw one) and went up to the room. Inside, it did indeed have twin beds but these were seperated off by a filthy wall partition accompanied by damp peeling wallpaper and almost threadbare carpets. The room was very dark and there was also an unbearable smell lurking everywhere in the hotel. We lugged our cases back to the reception and explained that the room was totally unacceptable. We were then allocated another room on the 2nd floor (up we went again with our cases) to find that we had been given another double room. We trudged back to the reception for the third time and after looking at 4 different rooms in total, we decided to stick with the last one as it seemed to be the best kept out of the lot and even that wasn't great but we hoped to be spending as little time in the room/hotel as possible. The bathroom was small but clean, as was the bed linen. The air conditioning was a very dated unit on the wall which did eventually work but was programmed not to go below 20 degrees. The wallpaper was peeling and the carpet looked as though it had been fitted by a partially sighted donkey ! Deciding to leave the room within the first half an hour, we went and explored the area around the hotel. What an absolute --------, nothing but rubbish strewn streets and buildings and shops full of grafitti. There were a few small cafe's dotted about and a supermarket round the side of the hotel which actually seemed ok. Bologna metro station was about 50 metres away which was handy - but it was definitely a badly cared for area. During our 3 day stay we visited lots of the main sights (apart from St Peters and the Sistene chapel which was not open on Sundays) and endured one poor meal after the other. We tried eating in lots of different areas but found nothing that actually tasted traditional/authentic or even nice, for that matter. I expected to be sampling delicious breads, cheeses and olives etc but found nothing of the sort. The closest thing we got to this was a basket of dry stale bread with one of the meals. I even tried the italian antipasti which was a plate containing a cheese slice, 2 dried up slices of salami and only 2 olives on that weren't even pitted ! We found the ice creams to be ok but again, nothing like I expected considering we were in Italy. Feeling very disapponted with the hotel, the food and even the italians (who appeared impatient and often rude) we prepared for our departure home. The night before we left, we asked the attendant on reception at San Giusto if he would be kind enough to book us a taxi to Ciampino airport early the following morning. He agreed and said that as we needed to be at the airport for 8.00am (and that the journey would take no longer than 25 minutes) a pick up of 7.30am would be sufficient and that we could have breakfast in the restaurant room at 7.00am before the taxi arrived. We were happy enough with this and actually felt quite pleased that at least one member of the hotel had succeeded in being helpful - HOW WRONG WE WERE !!! We were up and out of our room at 7.00am on the dot and arrived in reception to hand our keys in and attempt the breakfast that we had missed the previous 2 days. It was a different attendant on reception and when we explained that we were going for breakfast like they suggested, the attendant told us that breakfast was not available until 7.30am on Sundays (which completely contradicted the other attendant from the night before). Feeling frustrated after debating with the attendant what we had been previously told, we had no choice but to sit and wait the remaining 30 minutes until 7.30am for the taxi (without breakfast). Of course, 30 minutes came and went and no taxi arrived and when it reached 7.40am we asked the attendant to call the taxi firm and check on it's whereabouts. The attendant did this and discovered that no such taxi had even been booked by the previous attendant. Confused, we asked what was going on and the attendant assured us that he had now booked one and that it would arrive within 15 minutes. At this point we decided to quickly go up to the breakfast room just for a drink and a roll. We went in for the first time to find the set up of the room to be quite inviting and saw that a lady was filling up the juice containers, but again, no acknowledgement or greeting. We looked along the food table where there was a choice of only 2 pastries (both sweet), a plate of salami, ham and a plate of cheese slices next to a basket of unhealthy looking boiled eggs. Giving the small selection of food a miss, we picked up a glass for some juice to discover that they were absolutely filthy. We went through 6 different glasses until we found one that looked like it had actually been washed, quickly had some juice and hurried back to the reception. With the taxi still on its way (by now it's 7.55am) and leaving our cases in reception, we decided to walk to the end of the road to the cash machines. We were back within 5 minutes and the reception attendant said he had cancelled our taxi. Absolutely furious, we asked why and he replied "how am I supposed to know where you were going, if you are not here when the taxi arrives then we have to pay 50 euros" I then said "you can see our suitcases are here, we only went to the bank for a few minutes" and he just ignorantly shrugged his shoulders. We were absolutey furious, but I decided that after staying in a complete dump, experiencing so many problems and being treated terribly, I knew standing there shouting and arguing would get us nowhere, so we had to grit our teeth and silently admit defeat. We snatched our cases and stomped out of the hotel mumbling obscenities along the way. We hurried towards the metro station in fear of missing our flight. However, despite the problems we had and the overall disappointment with the food and hotel, we were actually still glad we visited Rome. The sights were enjoyabe and the weather was gloriously hot. But as for staying in this pathetic apology for a 3 star hotel - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!Do not go to this restaurant.Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size.My expectation of Encore by Wynn was that it is an exceptional hotel associated with another exceptional hotel. Well it tuened out to be more like a wolf in sheeps clothing. Check in was quick and fine and we got a room on the 38th floor and could have paid an extra $25 per night to get a higher hotel room. The room was plush and the bathroom was as big as the rest of the room. First thing I noticed as I checked the room out was that it had a lot of wasted space. It had a large what I thought was a dresser, but turned out to be just a display. It had no drawers and you couldn't open it. It also had a couple of more places you would think they would allow you to store things that were no more than cosmetics. I still thought the room was fine until I tried to turn on the big screen tv and it didn't work. That was my first call to the service desk. While waiting for them to arrive I noticed they had a collection of snacks and gifts sitting on the dresser thing. Well these were balanced on a device that if you removed any item you had 60 seconds to replace it otherwise you will be charged for it. This probably wouldn't be a big deal unless you wanted to read the contents of whatever it was. Speed reading anyone!!! Also noticed that there was no refrigerator. This prompted our second call to the service desk. Turns out you could rent on for $25 dollars a day. Hummm, that works out to $175 for a week. Fortunate for us the hotel is within walking distance of a Walgreen where we went a got a disposable ice chest and other goodies to tide us over for our 3 night stay. They came up and got the tv working and we were ready to dive into the casino and other offering of the hotel. The gaming is your usual slots and table games that all hotels offer. The place had several restaurants with the most intreging being the Sinatra. Decent prices for a high end Italian restaurant. The other restaurants were just over priced. The Encore is attached to the Wynn so you can go there as well but the two places are the same in decor and amenities. After a long drive to get to Vegas we called it an early night (about 12 midnight). The next day everything changed. I checked by checking account like I do everyday and found that $850 dollars had been charged to my account. I wanted to know what this was and it turns out that the hotel had charged me for the nights I was staying and they had an incidentals charge of $150 per night that was deducted from my account. Now I don't know about you but I have never stayed in a hotel that charged for the room upfront and most incidentals were either I take you card number or about a $100 refundable deposit. I asked why the incidental charge was so much and the responde was "we don't know it you will destroy the room or not". Excuse me, but what type of guests do you have it you think they will destroy the room. That sheds a bad light on the hotel. We inquired about an alternative to the incidental charge that they had taken out of my account and they had none. Personally I think tying up the amount of money they were tying up was taking away from us enjoying what the hotel had to offer. Not everyone uses credit , so of us pay as we go. This whole incident led us to not want to spend any more money in this hotel, so the remainder of the trip we eat and gambled elsewhere. But that wasn't the end of out problems. We returned to our room after one excusion and our toilet didn't work and another the electricity in the room didn't work. Needless to say we wern't happy campers at this hotel. The kicker came the morning of checkout. Part of the package deal we got from the hotel was a $75 dollar credit with the hotel. We hadn't used any of it so we decided to hit the pool early and then have breakfast by using this. The pool area is wonderful at this hotel. They have a regular pool and they have an adults only pool for those who want to go european style. Cabanas go for $300 to $400 dollars a day through the week and $400 to $500 a day for the weekend. The cabana is yours for the entire day, so you could leave and comeback later in the day. Well we charge a couple of bloody maria's while at the pool and then went to breakfast. Well when we tried to charge the breakfast on the room we were informed that we had checked out of the room already. It also turned out that the drinks we thought we had charged did not count either. So we ended up spending close to $70 dollars that we could have spent somewhere else. It was a very frustrating situation. How did we get checked out without our knowledge? The explaination from the hotel was that the hotel must have automatically checked us out. What? How does a hotel automatically check you out? We hadn't even went back to the room to get out stuff. What the heck!!! Well when we really did go down to get the explaination it wasn't pretty. Our complaints were so much that they had to pull us out of line and the hotel manager talked to us on the side. Turns out that they also have a policy of letting hotel personnel use each others name tags. The person who checked us into the hotel that didn't tell us about the incidentals or the upfront room charge had been using someone elses name tag. So the hotel couldn't identify who had checked us in. There was also different solutions to the incidental charge that could have been used. On top of all this when we were ready to leave the hotel we had our luggage sent to the valet parking and they lost our luggage. We had to wait in valet for almost 45 minutes before we could go. Also turns out that we were not the only ones who had a problem or two. Overall the experience was a total failure on the hotels part. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. As a matter of fact I would recommend that anyone looking for a great experience to go to the Pallazo and Veneitian hotel for a lot better experience.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Attached is the letter that I sent to hotel management, that came back to me with, "sorry your experience fell short of your expectations and the hotel restaurant has taken steps to correct." No free night stay, no restaurant vouchers, no credits to our credit card, no real attempt at keeping customers. Quite honestly, I donâ€™t even know where to begin. Every year, the second week in December my husband plans a downtown weekend for my birthday, which he has done for several years. This includes a minimum two-night stay, dinner and the theater. We live in the suburbs and love spending the weekend in the city. We enjoy shopping, holiday decorations and because of my birthday so close to the holiday, my husband takes special care to make it memorable. To date, we both immensely enjoy the weekend. All except this last birthday at the W Hotel City Center. I will highlight the less desirable incidents as I feel awful that my birthday celebration was such a disappointment. December 14, 2007 â€¢Upon arrival in the room, we had to turn the thermostat up because the room was freezing, I donâ€™t mean cold and uncomfortable but â€œsee your breathâ€� freezing. â€¢The bed was not a standard king, which was stated and the room extremely small. â€¢The sheet had a large stain which I am going to say was blood at the head of the bed between the pillows. I called the front desk immediately and let them know that we had reservations downstairs at the hotel restaurant at 7:15 p.m. and they could change the sheets while we were at dinner. â€¢We had dinner at the hotel restaurant (Ristorante We). Absolutely the worst service of any restaurant that we have been to and the food was mediocre at best. From the time we were seated, it took 10 minutes to get a glass of water and my husband had to wave someone down to ask for bread. It took another 10 minutes for the waiter to take our order. As we had plenty of time to look at the menu we ordered the appetizer and entrÃ©e initially. It took 25 minutes to receive our appetizer. At that point, we were in the restaurant 45 minutes before receiving an appetizer! The entrÃ©e arrived in another 20 minutes. My husband insisted we order a dessert, I told him that I was unwilling to wait 45 minutes for dessert but he insisted that it was my â€œbirthday weekendâ€� and he was equally upset with everything, but remained optimistic determined to have a good time. We ordered dessert. Not only did it 30 minutes to get to us, the order was wrong. My crÃ¨me brulee was chocolate cake and then the waiter was indignant when I said, â€œI didnâ€™t order thisâ€�. He said that he would put in the order for crÃ¨me brulee. At that point, the tears started and I asked my husband for the key to our room and waiting another 30 minutes for my dessert was simply absurd. I left the restaurant and waited in the lobby until he was finished with the bill. We he left the restaurant, he then said, â€œyou will NEVER believe thisâ€�, not only did he not remove the incorrect dessert from the bill, he haggled me when I told him that it needed removed from the bill and I didnâ€™t even ask him to remove the dessert that I didnâ€™t eat. My husband said, which even surprised me, â€œtoday is the first day in my entire life that I left NO tip, though the service was lousy until he hassled me about the dessert, I had every intention of leaving a tip. â€¢After that horrible experience, we return to the room only to find the sheets had not been changed. I told my husband that I have had enough of the W hotel and I was going to take a long shower, while he took a shot at getting some clean sheets. Sometime after 10 p.m. the sheets where finally changed. December 15 â€“ 8:00 a.m. â€¢We left the hotel to go downtown to shop (bought new fleece pajamaâ€™s because the room was so cold) and returned to our hotel at 3:30 p.m. to get ready for our 5:00 p.m. reservations at Everest then to the theater for Jersey Boys â€“ Time was of the essence. It had begun to snow so we needed to leave by 4:30 p.m. Upon returning, our room had not been touched, we where gone all day and no one had cleaned the room. The cleaning lady showed up a 3:45 p.m. to clean our room, so we went downstairs to have a drink while our room was cleaned. At that point, my husband apologized for picking such a horrible hotel for my birthday. He said he was ashamed of himself for not doing more research and picked the room from a website because it had a contemporary eclectic style. He felt awful and I felt bad for him and bad that we were stuck there for another night. â€¢With 4+ inches of snow that we had overnight, the room was freezing when we returned. We thought the cleaning lady had set the thermostat back down, but we discovered she had not. We turned the heat up for the second night in a row. December 16 â€¢Packing up to leave the room, in adjusting the blinds and drapes realize the window was OPEN. The window was open about an inch and would not close no matter how hard we tried, it was broken open. Which explained why the sounds of the city kept us up every night. My husband has apologized with shame countless times, and ends with â€œI just wanted you to have a great birthday.â€� Isnâ€™t your motto - Whatever, whenever? Based on the service we received, it sure didnâ€™t feel like it to us. The next time we will spend time doing extensive research (to include on-line reviews) before choosing a hotel or simply stay home and drive to the city for dinner and the theater. We will certainly not recommend the W Hotel or the Ristorante We in the future.Billed as a family friendly resort, we chose Paradise Point as the place to stay when we took our 3 year old to San Diego for his first family vacation. Placing our reservations a month in advance, I decided to splurge and reserve the bay view junior suite. We arrive with an exhausted, nap-ready kid at 2PM; we were told that our room was not ready yet, we're given pool keys, and told that we could visit any of the resort's pools while we wait. I ask for our room # so that I we could park and visit the pool closest to our room... we're told that they could not disclose our room #. Huh? Things got worse from there. At 3:30, we were given the go ahead to check in. We picked up our room keys, opened the door, and discovered that we had been given a garden view suite, not the bay view I had reserved. Strike 2. Going to the front desk and requesting a new room at this point is untenable...our child is exhausted...we decide to speak with the front desk the next day. That night, after the boy went to sleep, my wife and I decide to enjoy a glass of wine and some quiet time. We discover that we're not alone...another tenant, a 2 inch long cockroach is sauntering across the floor. This roach was so big, that I could have either smashed him with a shoe or put a leash around him...he does go very well with the three spiders in the ceiling. Strike 3. The roach successfully dispatched, our wine drank, we decide to call it a night...did I mention that we had to go to the store to buy plastic cups to drink our wine because the wet bar in our suite had no cups, no plates, no silverware, nothing? We crawl into bed and discover a blood stain on our duvet. It's not an OJ Simpson sized blood stain, but large enough that the maid should have caught it...we feel the benefit of the doubt slowly shrinking away. Morning. Surprised the coffee maker works, I have my morning cup and climb into the shower. When I get out, I reach for a towel to dry myself only to discover that it is as soft as a roofing tile. Seriously some free beach towels we got at dodger stadium that we use to dry our dog are soft as silk compared with ones. After a big day we return during naptime (1:30 PM) only to discover that the maid hasn't made up our room yet...so, off to the pool we go while we wait for housekeeping. Strike #?? I've lost count. My lovely bride stays with the boy (and her cocktail) at the pool while I visit the front desk to discuss my first day at PP. The guy at the front desk promises the maid will be earlier tomorrow, to report the insect infestation, and that the OJ duvet will be replaced. And the bayview room? He tells me that we got a free UPGRADE from a Bayview Junior Suite to a Garden View Suite. How thoughtful. It would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted this generous upgrade. Day 3. The towels are still exfoliating me, housekeeping had finished by the time we returned from Seaworld, and no signs of any other 6 or 8 leg co-tenants...maybe they're turning this thing around? Fat chance. That night we ordered an early dinner so we would have time to make smores at the fire pit in the main pool area with our son. We arrive at the fire pit at 7:30 PM. No fire. A couple sitting nearby tell us that they have already put in a request to have the fire lit. Not taking any chances I go to the front desk. The woman behind the desk tells me that she'll "put in a request for the service." When I ask her what that means, she tells me that she punches in the request in the computer which will cause someone to show up "soon." Not very reassuring. 7:45 PM. No fire. I return to the front desk. This time there are three parties ahead of me checking in. The woman at the front desk knows why I'm there, but she pretends she doesn't see me to make me wait. When I get to the front of the line, she explains that she doesn't know why the fire hasn't been lit yet. I suggest, impatiently, that perhaps she should pick up the phone and call someone. Her manager beckons me, promises she'll have someone there right away. 8:15 PM. Still no fire. My son is doing his best at waiting patiently for smores. I am no longer patient. So I bring him and his marshmallow laden stick to the front desk. The women there still have no answer for the delay, and seemingly no empathy for my problem. Exasperated, on my way out, I tell them to "light the damn fire pit." The manager behind the front desk threatens to evict me. Unreal. 8:30 PM. We talk with a security guard walking through the main pool area. He gets on his radio. The fire pit is lit within five minutes. Was that so hard? 10:00 PM. We decide to crawl into bed for our final night at the hotel. We pull down the sheets and see the familiar blood stain on the bedspread. Well, I guess I cannot complain lest my evicted family has to spend the night in our car.i dont know what some people who rave about this hot dog are talking about.Feel Deceived To say the least we were very disappointed in this resort for our 25thAnniversary. What we experienced was very misleading according to our agent  brochure.24 hour all-inclusive does not mean 24 hours. Pool  bar close at 6 pmat the latest, all bars  restaurants throughtout the resort open  close at all different times, therefore again no 24 hour all-inclusive.Upon arrival we changed rooms twice from our original room, due to having paid for an upgraded room which was supposed to be close to thebeach, but nowhere close  overlooked a beautiful construction sight with constant traffic. Brochure does not mention formal dining  dress code. We were turned away from one alacarte rest. for only having a pair of dress shorts, but did see ratty holey frayed blue jeans  sweat pants entering with no problem. If you are looking for a fine dining experience, this might appeal to you, but I would still question the quality of food  service. Although the servers appear to be helpful  understand, very few could comprehend or understand, or speak English,  our Spanish islimited, so therefore very frustrating for both parties. Although not our problem, if you must have knowledge of what you are eating or how it is prepared for any medical/allergy reason DO NOT EAT HERE! Chef  waitors do not understand, even when translated. If this is fine dining I want no part of it.In celebrating our 25th our agent told us we would have 5 alacartes. We tried booking them at time of check-in, we had absolutely no choices whatsoever as rest. - told almost all booked solid. Diamond Club rep was able to squeeze us in at French, Italian, Steakhouse  Seafood. French was a huge disappointment - horrible, cold food, Italian - looked at menu  cancelled, Steakhouse - the steak was just okay, but potato, veg, tomato, onions were all cold. People all aroundus said exactly the same of their food - mostly cold. Butter would not even melt on the potato. Dessert was excellent, particularily the bread pudding WITHOUT whiskey, but with cream - delicious. Seafood -was supposed to receive a special dish of lobster tail, BUT the lobster had the you-know-what boiled out of it - so tasteless  tough, absolutely no flavour whatsoever - terrible. We were surprised  disappointed,  misled that the lobster  crab would be served in abundance, when actually I don't think they even had crab,  lobster unless a special order or in a tiny bit in a salad. When we were booking the alacartes we were told there were no reservations available, but we observed that ALL alacartes rest. were NEVER more than half full at any time. 100% of people we met said exactly the same thing. Therefore in upgrading to Diamond, paying for Diamond in advance which includes 3 or 5 alacartes, you do not neccesarily get them ! Nor can you repeat in any of the rest. during your stay. The resorts policies seem to change from guest to guest,  depending on how well they understand what you are trying to explain to them, whatever your situation happens to be at that particular time.We found the safes are rented for anywhere from 21 to 35 US dollars. If they do not work, you have to sign your life away with proof of your idenity  apparently no less than three staff managers must sign the refund requisition in order to get your money back, which could take the duration of your stay.A non smoking room is NOT available at this resort, although we requested this our agent did not tell us that, nor does it state this in the brochure.The main lobby we found to be extremely smokey of cigarettes  cigars,most every evening. Unbearable at times.The well stocked mini bar in an upgraded Diamond Club consists of 4 bottles of pop, 1 water bottle,  two cans of beer daily. This is ALL-INCLUSIVE  WELL STOCKED?? We were unsuccessful in obtaining any more or different varieties. We were not short on giving out tips, which were usually anywhere from2 - 5 US dollars for bars, along with cash  non monetary gifts to housekeeping ( baseball cap  toiletries, school supplies, each  every day of our 7 day/night stay).Seems face cloths are in short supply at this resort, as one day it took us more that 12 hours to get one facecloth.As for the all inclusive activities, they are very limited due to the size of the resort, with 1824 rooms, about 4000 guests we were told, therefore access  reservations unworkable.You have to request most of the upgrades, as they don't seem to be offered, like the towels, bathrobes,  alarm clock.We were led to believe that the upgrade to the Diamond Club was the top ungrade, when in actuality there is higher, the Premier  Golden.We found the atmosphere is be rather drab, as there was very little music during the day, other than lobby washrooms (Christmas music up to New Years eve). We observed many buses being greeted with a beverage, dancers, with pre-arranged keys  bellhop. We experienced non of these.We think we are a pretty easy going couple having travelled many timesbefore to all inclusive resorts, but we found this resort displaying incompetent management with friendly but NOT a full comprehension of the English language. The most common reply to any issue seemed to bewe are fully booked  that's all we have  from our rep, take it orleave it.Needless to say will will not recommend this resort to anyone, nor will we ever be back, especially when there are so many other beautiful, well managed resorts available in the Caribean where you GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,  isn't that what is all about, for with no hassles.I should mention this, we were told by Punta Cana airport staff on departure because we were 14 lbs over the weight limit we had to pay $130 US when checking in. They weighed our check-in baggage  carry-on. Our carry-on bags were not checked on departure from Canada. After much Spanish between 4 people, in the end we had to pay $100 US, received no receipt. The five $20, bills were hurriedly grabbed frommy hand, as if trying to hide this transaction. Fishy - I certainly think so !We went to the Sandos Caracol 2-10th September, which I know what you're thinking its hurricaine season, but the weather was fine the whole time we were there except the day we left it rained. What wasn't fine was the Hotel. This hotel is classed as 4* but at best, and only because it has a few pools, it is a 3*. Due to the number of ponds around the hotel it is a breeding ground for mosquitos so if you do go, take your repellent with you. If you were lucky eoungh you get a balcony overlooking a smelly stagnant pond or you get a stuffy seaview room with no balcony, where the air con never quite gets cool enough and your room stays aroung 26-29C, and you have no where to dry towels and swimming costumes. 4/7 days we had brown hot water, on a couple of occassions there was no water at all! The electricity went off in our room one day, but only for plugs, and when reported I was called back to say that I needed to put the room card in a box to turn the lights on, not something we had in our room! - obviously hadn't heard me when I kept trying to tell them that the lights worked but we had no plugs, ie; aircon, fridge etc... The room we had was something like a motel on the side of a busy road that you stop at because you have to! So putting the room to oneside, I'll begin on the food. With the exception of "la Riviera" & "El Gaucho" which where bookable restaurants the food resenbled something like old style school dinners - think turkey twizzlers pre-"jamie's school dinners" and you'll get the idea! The cuts of meat used where the cheapest, pasta and potato still hard where not cooked properly and at one point we were even being served pineapple out of a tin - still I suppose that counts towards your 5 a day. In the bookable restaurants our courses were rushed through, with the exception of La Riviera, and it was confirmed to us by one of the waiting staff that they had to clear away quickly and serve the next course immediately as they had 3 sittings to get through in an evening. We were given 1- 1&1/2 hours at most to "enjoy" our 3 bookable meals for the week. If you eat out quite frequently, as we do, then you'll be used to the tables being cleared all together when everyone has finished, not here, if one person finished before the other their plate was cleared leaving an uncomfortable eating environment with people rushing or leaving food as you felt put on to hurry up! Bear in mind when you go to the restaurants, and bars, that none of them are air-conditioned (unless you count the occassional sea breeze!) so when picking your outfits make them as cool as possible. Pretty much 95% of the people there did not dress up in the evening for dinner it was shorts etc that would normally be worn during the day. The hotel had no real dress rule for restaurants except no swimwear in the bookable ones in the evening. Having been to a number of 4+* hotels we have become accustommed to the fact that at least 1 restaurant would be smart and have a shirt rule, not here its all very casual (it even says that on the receipts when you book your table). Finally on the restaurants you have to have booked your meal by 3pm, which if you choose to do excertions is really difficult as you don't tend to get back until 4-6pm so I would advise booking them all at the start of your holiday so you get good time slots and make the most of your bookable allowance the hotel set. The entertainment staff worked really hard day and night trying to keep things going but it did hit a bit of the hotel in "Dirty Dancing" - we never did find the staffs dance area though! The Bars struggled with not enough staff on to cope with te demand so there were queues and definately not enough waiting on staff. The paino bar had 3 waitresses and on a number of occassions they cleared away glasses but never offered refills. In the sports bar we waited 45 mins to have our glasses cleared and rather than offer us more drinks the waitress the proceeded to stand and watch the show instead of serve the customers. There is no waiting service by the pool at all. With the exception of the lobby and piano bar (which has no piano in it by the way) Plastic Cups, like those you use at BBQ's and kids parties then throw away, were used to serve drinks in - fine for by the pool on the beach but in the evening?? are we the clientel that inept that we cannot be trusted with real glasses in fear that we may be likely to start breaking the glasses so only deserve cheap plastic cups? At one point I went to go and get the drinks rather than my boyfriend and whilst waiting at the bar I got greated with "Yeah Lady, what do you want?" this is the first time in a hotel I've been addressed this way when trying to order drinks. There are no bar stools at any of the bars (including the one in the pool) so its doesn't encourage the staff to get to know the guest and talk to them. We went armed with dollars for tipping, as after our holiday in the Dominican we thought we'd really need them as the service was excellent there, but we didnt need them as the service here was awful. Towards the end of the holiday we were walking through the hotel when a couple of reception staff started asking us about any problems with service and the hotel. We told them what had happened and when I questioned them about the star rating they said it was a 5*!!!! I don't think so. We also complained to our rep about everything and he said that it didn't surprise him and that it was like a motel 6 that you just passed through! You may think I'm just ranting and snobby but had I known all this before I booked I never would have gone to this hotel as by talking to other guest who had travelled a lot also this was a shared experience.I was in Vegas in December 2010 for an industry conference being held at Caesar's conference center. I was offered a room at the hotel at a good "conference" rate and was pretty excited to be able to stay at Caesars - "oh, that will be really nice, Caesar's is one of the more upscale of the hotel/casinos in Vegas" everyone told me. Wow, what a miserable experience. After a 10-hour day of sightseeing/scenic driving on the way back to Vegas for my conference (I flew to Vegas from the east coast but had rented a car to do a bunch of sightseeing for a few days in Utah at Zion/Bryce/Capitol Reef) I tried to figure out where to park to check-in for Caesars and did nothing except upset the valets and taxis who shooed me "you can't stop here go park." So I had to go park in the big garage, walk approx. 8-10 minutes through two casino floors (and beg for directions from some casino floor worker through the meandering maze with vague wayfinding posts) to find my way from self-park to the registration desk. When I asked the woman at registration if there was a place to stop to unload my bags first and then go self-park she looked at me like I had three heads and snarled, "no, there's the valet but there's, like, no, there's no place to just park so you can drop off your bags, no. The bellman will help you with your bags." So I checking in was about a 45-50 minute ordeal walking back and forth to the car three times: car --> registration --> car --> hotel room with one heavy bag --> car --> hotel room with heavy bag #2, each time walking probably 1/3 mile. The Bell Desk had such a long line it would have been useless and I have to say that the entire 4 days I was there I never once saw a bellman helping a single guest with bags. I did notice later in the week many other poor, sad, tired, lost-looking folks dragging huge suitcases across the smoky, meandering casinos. They put me in the Roman Tower - which I later figured out from reviews here is one of the two dumpiest towers. Wish I had checked TripAdvisor ahead of time. My room hadn't been renovated in at least 15-20 years. Everything was old, banged up, cracked, the door rim on the bathroom door was falling off. Both beds were so old they had a dip in them and I could feel the springs. I ended up stripping the one bed and rotating and flipping the mattress to a side that was less worn so I could sleep. The one thing that I thought would redeem the room - the jetted tub - blew pieces of dark greenish mold into the tub when activated! Disgusting! I lept out of the tub dripping wet and nearly screaming. Truly vile. I had to call housekeeping to clean the tub and I was pretty skeeved taking a shower. The TV was ancient and picture was terrible. I know you're not supposed to be in your room watching TV in Vegas, but I wanted to unwind with it a couple of nights... and as you'll read if you search other reviews, there were adjoining doors to both sides and I could everything going on next to me. Finally, I understand perhaps no fridge or microwave but no coffeemaker? Seriously? I count on having a cup brewing while I'm in the shower. (I ended up going out to get some Starbucks Via and using the super hot water from the tap to make coffee the remaining mornings a mug I had with me.) Everything in Caesar's is overpriced. Thank goodness my company was paying. I also got hit with the "would you like to upgrade to an XYZ fancier room?" on check-in (umm, no, I'm here on the conference rate - a.k.a. my company is paying and they're not gonna approve an upgrade.) The "would you like to upgrade..." went on for four days straight. I couldn't request a wake-up call without having the operator ask me if I'd like to place a room service breakfast order. $15/day for internet. $20-something to use the fitness center... Caesar's nickel and dimes you at every turn. When I tried to ask the hostess at Beijing Noodle 9 for some suggestions from the menu, she acted like it was a big inconvenience, confused me into asking a dumb question (that I was pretty sure was a dumb question but she was the one making no sense), then went over to place my order and I noticed her talking to the cook and he was looking at me and laughing. After my horrible check-in experience and horrible experience at Beijing Noodle, I made sure that all of my discretionary spending on meals, gambling and entertainment went elsewhere - mostly the MGM Grand, and TI (where I took in Mystere and Ka) and New York, New York. I ended my stay at Caesars a day early (an extra day I was staying to sightsee on my own dime) to find something nicer and cheaper (half price!) for one night. I've been to Vegas before and stayed at Luxor, which was a great experience, and the Sahara, which despite being one of the cheaper strip establishments was still a better experience than Caesars. Unless you are a high-rolling VIP with money to burn stay away from Caesars. They ripped off my company for $149/night on a piece of crap room and when I later did some research I found out I could have gotten a nice deal at many of the other strip hotels for half that -- Luxor, MGM, Mirage, Monte Carlo etc. are all offering good deals to get your business -- and I would have probably had a better experience. Caesars treats their conference goers (and probably all the other everyday folks not paying their prime rates) like crap which is a shame because I was excited to be there and willing to spend my own personal money there shopping, eating and playing slots if they had treated me with a little more dignity.I stayed at the Chateau Cervantes on New Year's Eve with my five-person family, after having completed a fantastic cruise to the Southern Caribbean, and as someone who travels frequently, I was astounded by the incredibly poor service, room quality, and overall experience provided by the Cervantes, particularly given the expense. Even though we only stayed for just one night, we experienced an inordinate number of issues (see them listed below), and the response we received from management regarding these issues only became more aloof and unaccommodating with each interaction. 1. Uncomfortable, Unacceptable Sleeping Situation. We were permitted to reserve, and were subsequently placed, in the Penthouse Suite--a double-occupancy room--even though we were a family of five. The hotel frequently loads more than two people into this suite, so they thought this would also be appropriate for our large family, and the sleeping spaces that they presented to us were one king-sized bed, a full-sized sleeper sofa (which my sister and I, both thirty-somethings, had to share) and an airbed on the floor. For an $800 room, the minimum one would expect is a real bed to sleep in, and only two out of the five of us could claim this. 2. Poor Room Design. The Penthouse Suite was clearly designed for couples who want to do nothing else but bathe and/or sleep, since the space allows for no other activities. The TV was in the bedroom but didn't face the bed, and only a few, very uncomfortable ottomans/chairs were set in front of the TV (which, by the way, had intermittent sound a few channels). The only way for five of us to watch TV was through the picture-window in the living room. Ironically, this ended up being somewhat of a blessing, since the bedroom also had a picture-window into the bath/shower area, allowing zero privacy for anyone wishing to bathe (very awkward for families). Lastly, lighting, outlets, and mirrors were clearly the last priorities when designing the space, since they were sparse and placed in ridiculous places. Example: no mirrors by the bathroom sink/vanity. 3. Maintenance Issues. As mentioned in previous reviews, the A/C and hot water are intermittent. A/C worked for us, but was incredibly loud--so loud that the private terrace offered nothing but the sounds of mechanical grumblings and views of a wall of plants (bamboo, I think?) blocking the parking lot across the street. Hot water was also iffy: we had it, but some showers got lukewarm by the end. The key cards stopped functioning in the middle of the night. The wifi only worked in the lobby, not in the room. And the telephones didn't work at all. 4. Poor Hotel Service. We could not check in to our room until after 4:30pm, despite the 3pm check-in. This was particularly unfortunate, since we disembarked from our cruise at 10am. Also, our room was only stocked with four towels (see #1), and despite asking three times, with assurances that they would bring up at least one more towel for our fifth family member, the towels never came. Also, none of the front desk staff was very knowledgeable about nearby restaurants, activities, etc. They would call places we identified but couldn't offer recommendations. 5. Indifferent, Unprofessional Management Response. The manager, Michelle Colon, was incredibly unhelpful. Any one of the aforementioned issues would be enough to issue a complaint, but taken together, they made the price of the room absolutely outrageous, and we sought some sort of response or compensation. During our first phone conversation (made on one of the front-staff's cell phones, about two hours after trying to reach her on the one working telephone in the hotel), we were told that there was absolutely nothing that could be done to make our sleeping situation more comfortable: no additional rooms, mattresses, or airbeds or any other offer, only the one free drink provided to my father during the 90+ minutes we waited for our room. We spoke with Michelle again the following morning, after we overheard her agree to issue a 10% refund to another couple due to their hot water problems. Although she said that she could not offer us the same, since our floor did have hot water, she would speak again to "the owner" to see what she could do. This was a phone conversation in Spanish, which I assume she thought we didn't understand, since she was flippant in her description of our concerns, referred to them as stupid, and highlighted that she had already given us a complimentary drink at the bar (as though this were sufficient). It's unclear whether or not "the owner" actually exists, since Michelle is not permitted to provide this person's direct phone number or email address, but this person(?) did end up giving Michelle authorization to issue us a 5% refund. We took what we could get, but not surprisingly, we did not believe that this was nearly enough. Note: this ended up being an actual refund, rather than a discount, since they put through the full room charge the night before our check-out. The hotel is in a convenient location in Old San Juan, which is an absolutely lovely and interesting place to visit, and I can definitely sympathize with travelers who would prefer to stay in a local, boutique hotel rather than at one of the chain hotels. But, in this case, due to the terrible service and management, the poor design choices prioritizing style over functionality, and the disruptive maintenance issues, I would definitely recommend any other option over this one. And never, ever pay $800+ for the Penthouse Suite, since it will never, ever be worth it.Horrible does not begin to describe this 鈥榟otel鈥?! Review for Quality Suites13636 Goldmark Dr. Dallas, TxDo NOT stay here!!!(Sorry in advance that this is so long, but I feel you really must read!)We had reservations to stay at this hotel because I had to go to Dallas for medical test.I did my first round of test and we went to the hotel to check in. My friend went in, checked us in and off we went to our room. We were supposed to have a Smoking King Room with Sleeper sofa.I did not go in the first time, because it is difficult for me to walk. So of course our room was (in building 11) upstairs. We opened the door to our room and there was a massive stench. But we proceeded on to check it out. We found:- There were stains all over the carpet, - Burn marks, - A metal vent covering in the bathroom that was just hanging down loose. That could have seriously hurt someone since the ceiling was slanted and it hung down so low. I鈥檓 short, but it could have hit me in the head.- Some of the lights came on, some did not. - Most of the electrical outlets did not have any covers on them. (We did finally find the source of the stench. There was standing, moldy water in the dishwasher. Along with dirty dishes). - There was not a working lock on the door. Not even a safety lock up top that every hotel on earth has. - No ashtrays in a smoking room. - NO bedding for the foldout sofa.I called the front desk and got a man. I told him some of the issues in the room; he said he would send someone up right away. After waiting for quite some time, with no one showing up鈥?I called back. This time I got a personality impaired young girl. She said 鈥淚鈥檓 talking to a customer, call back鈥? And hung up on me. Well what am I? I called back about 5 minutes later and she said, 鈥淗ow did you get in that room?鈥?I told her we checked in about an hour ago. 鈥淪he said, 鈥淚 don鈥檛 know how you got in that room. If you want to talk to me come down to the desk.鈥?I told her that is why I was calling鈥?it鈥檚 hard for me to walk all over the complex. She said, 鈥淚f you have something to say come down here. I don鈥檛 know why you are in that room!!!鈥? And hung up on me..again!We hobbled down to the front desk. Which was not easy. Explained everything to Miss. Personality. She did try to defend the room. And tell me that it was ok. Which it was NOT. I was not a happy customer at this point. A man showed up behind the counter and told her to cancel someone else鈥檚 reservations and give us that room. I asked if it was smoking. They said yes. And it鈥檚 a King room, correct? Yes, yes it is. It was on the other side of the complex in building 17. I explained to them again how hard it was to walk up and down the stairs. And all over the complex. Their attitude was 鈥榦h well鈥? No help with luggage 鈥?nothing.So we had to walk back to our building, up a flight of stairs, get our luggage, walk back down the stairs, load everything back up in the car, drive to building 17, unload everything again, walk back up another flight of stairs to finally get to the second room.This room looked like someone had kicked the door in at some point. The molding around the door was half way tacked back on. There was a gap in the door, so you could see in the room from the hallway.Being gluttons for punishment 鈥?we proceeded on to the room. This room was much smaller. It did have a sofa 鈥?that was broken! The cushions would not even fit on it anymore. And it had that鈥? 鈥楧irty upholstery feel to it. - This carpet was worse than the first room. Didn鈥檛 know that could be possible. But it was.- There was NO kitchen. After assuring us there would be. - The refrigerator was broken. (Which was all we had. No microwave鈥othing else)- Same deal with the electrical outlets. Most did not have a cover on them. - There was a huge gap in the floor going out to the balcony. If you had a Chihuahua it could have gone through this gap under the door without a problem.- The nails were all coming up on the balcony. Neither of us tempted fate to step out onto it. I鈥檓 quite certain it would not have held us up!- There was again, NO lock on the balcony door. None.- There was NOT a king bed. Not even a queen. It was a full size bed 鈥?with one tiny little pillow. Like a throw pillow. Maybe one foot by one foot. With NO pillow case. - And the air-conditioning was broken.- NO bible in either room. Not a big deal to some, but we found it odd.So, I again called the front desk. I got Mrs. Personality again who told us to come to the front desk. I told her that was not happening鈥?and the problems with the room.I was told that we could not get another pillow because each room has a pillow and that is all that they have. Pretty much deal with it. No pillow case. No extra pillow. That is just how the room is. Come to the front desk and they would see what else they had.We really didn鈥檛 need to talk about it anymore. I was beyond irritate at this point. I told her never mind. We would look for another hotel. And do NOT charge us for this room. This was ridiculous. The manager was there and told her to tell me that he would give me $5 (Five dollars) off of the room if we would stay! Haha. I would not have stayed at that point if he had paid for the room! They assured us that we would not be charged.It was nasty, filthy, serious personality issues with the 鈥榮taff鈥?and basically NOT a safe place to stay. So called hot tub packed with leaves and debris. Pool was.. not something I felt safe in testing without a medic close at hand. I have been all over the world. I have stayed in some pretty odd places in third-world countries 鈥?they were by far much better than this place! Even in Belize (before it became a big tourist attraction) had some pretty strange places to stay. But they were clean. And they were at least friendly. This place needs to be shut down. We did go on to find a really nice room for only $10 more at Best Western Suites 鈥?Addison. Which I don鈥檛 care how much more it was. It was worth every penny!They had a wonderful happy hour. Wonderful. Very nice staff, everything was just amazing. They made you feel like you were staying in a 4-star hotel. I would highly recommend it!!After getting back home, we found out that they did charge our credit card for the room. But would release the funds. Which will take several weeks. I called the 800 number for the chain and complained. I was told that they could not refund the money, nor pay for us having to move, no compensation at all because each hotel was individually owned. So it was up to that owner to decide what to do. Want to guess what this owner has done? ** there was a sign by the pool that said 鈥淧lease shower before entering鈥?br/>I have never seen that before. You know it had to be a problem at some point for them to put this huge sign up!Stayed at Xcaret December 11th to December 18th. When I booked the trip I read many reviews, and they pretty much all sounded good. I expected more from (what they claim at Xcaret) is a 5 star facility since I paid substantially more at Xcaret then what I paid for when I stayed in July 2004 at the CROWN PARADISE Hotel Resort (CP) in Cancun, which was rated at 4 stars. However, I read some of the reviews just before I left to Xcaret, and they got me a bit worried. I said to myself, "No worry, see for yourself, and try to have a great time in any case." Boy, was I in for a surprize! I stayed in Building 16, Room 16311 on the 3rd floor, which was one of the best buildings to be in overlooking the main pool. That was about the only high-point in the entire stay. The ROYAL CLUB is way out in the back, and unless you like a hefty walk to get around you have to wait for the golf cart tram to lug you from place to place. It looked OK, had its own restaurant (what hint does that give you), and had a gated entrance with a guard to keep the "other" guests out. I am sorry to say that the Xcaret was a waste of money. Yes, the hotel resort itself is very nice and well kept, but the FOOD and SERVICE was a joke! I am still getting over my indigestion. The variety of food served is very limited, is usually cold, and after two days your looking at and eating the same stuff over and over again. What they served is tasteless. The "specialty" restaurants (which I was restricted to 4 reservations in 7 days, unlike the CP which gave you unlimited access) were not any better than the "Le Buffet" (or what I call "Le Garbage"). Note that at least one of the five specialty restaurants is closed each day, for what I still cant figure out. Don't waste your time, the portions are bite size at best, the food is bland and the service is just as lousy as it is in the main "Le Garbage", which is the main "chow hall". The Beach Club "doubles" as the "La Pescadora" seafood restaurant. and the food was lousy there. You even have 'self serve' salad and desserts, (exept at La Pescadora) which are the same as the ones you will find in "La Garbage". Ate at the Steak Restaurant and had "Five Chili Steak.". I swear that it was nothing more than an overcooked piece of beef with A-1 Staek Sauce on it. Just about every morning we went to the "Beach Club" for breakfast. The hostess seats you fast, and then after that you are pretty much on your own, There were no spoons on the place setting to stir coffee, and the waiter (if your lucky enough to get him to pay any attention to you) pours you one cup of coffee then leaves. There was no salt and pepper on the tables, nor cream for the coffee. The food is presented in tin trays left over a heated surface and heat lamps overhead to dry it out even more. No bacon, except one day, was found - and that was cooked to a crisp. Mostly everything was cold, including the pancakes. Nothing came fresh off the grill EXCEPT your omelots - which you have to prepare your ingredients yourself on a dish and hand to the cook - except for the cheese. Lots of unedible Mexican dishes, but who eats Frajitas in the morning? Don't worry though, you will get whatever is leftover again at lunch - or dinner! There is no room service either. Food pretty much disappears after 11 PM, except PACO TACOS till 2 pm, but you can get better at a TACO BELL. The "up" side to staying at this resort was the free admission to 'XCARET PARK", which was a great place to see - lots to do and certainly a "don't miss" wherever you stay on the Riviera Maya - especially the "Mexico Spectacular" show each night at 6 PM - a two hour presentation that makes the visit worth every peso. But DO NOT book a tour to visit Xcaret park through one of those pesky hotel sales or tour agents in the hotel!! You can easily get to it by taxi (or bus from Cancun) and pay the admission price, and it is substantially cheaper. My HATS OFF to Silvestrio, the bartender at the "swing chair" bar next to the main pool outside my building. He was the ONLY guy that gave great service during my whole stay. I tipped him accordingly, and he was the only one I did tip. I always tip for good service, and don't mind too, but good service was missing at Xcaret. The "down" side to the hotel are many. Pools are ice cold, the "beach " is nothing more than a man made inlet with poor water circulation, very "hazy" water - lots of seaweed left un-picked up on the beach, the food and service stink, food service is limited, and the mixed drinks are differently made from bar to bar. Best found drinks are at the "Le Buffet" (aka "Le Garbage"). I also did not go for the "topless" at the "Beach Club" and main pool. I personally have no problem with it, but your kids should not be exposed to that stuff. At the CROWN PARADISE they had a "adults only" pool for those wishing to "show it off. " After my second day I approched the Hotel manager at Xcaret and requested to be refunded my unused nights. I wanted to go up to Cancun (at my own expense) and book my remaining nights at CROWN PARADISE. He said I had to put it in writing, which I did, but to no avail - no refunds! I was STUCK for 5 more days of tasteless food, poor service and pretty much a boring resort. If you are into looking at iguanas sitting on the rocks, boozing all day, sitting by the pool (too cold to swim in) and not eating, then this is certainly the place for you. But you can pretty much do that at any other All Inclusive resort. However, if you want a much better resort, with a GREAT VARIETY of FRESH COOKED and HOT served foods and GREAT SERVICE, I would recommend the CROWN PARADISE in Cancun. Unlike the Xcaret, they have freshly prepared and HOT food available all night until 6:30 am - chicken fingers, FRESH COOKED Cheeseburgers, nachos and cheese, etc. They have 24 hour room (food) service, great pools (with poolside hot snack stands - FRESH SERVED off the grill cheeseburgers, chicken, macaroni / potatoe salads, etc) and a BEAUTIFUL oceanfront beach. The 6 specialty restaurants at CP which are easily accessible for reservations, always open, distinctly specialized in theme food (good portions) and desserts - and you dont have to get out of your chair from salad to desert. The food was great and service as good as a great cruise line. Please undersatnd that I am by no means a "nit-pick." I am giving you an OBJECTIVE review of Xcaret. I travel around the world frequently and KNOW what is good and what isn't. Occidental Grand Flamenco Xcaret Resort is NOT the place to stay, and I will be telling my travel agent to recommend it, and you good readers NOT to stay there. recommend it.Have just returned to the UK having spent 4 nights at the Wellington booked through Thomas Cook and we can confidently say we will not be booking another trip with Thomas Cook and when we do return to NYC we will not be staying at the Wellington! This holiday was a disaster from start to finish. The only positives were NYC and British Airways (surprising I know)! We arrived at the Hotel having been collected by a Thomas Cook representative (who later claimed she didn't work for TC but was quite happy to collect her commission from selling various tours) - there was no register or check conducted to make sure everyone was collected, and we later heard of couples who had been left at the airport or left at the hotel. On check in we learned that no room had been reserved for us and after lenghty conversations with both the TC rep and the Hotel Manager a room was found for us for two nights, but with no guarantee of anything further. We were told our rep would resolve this by the time we arrived for the NY City Tour the following morning. Initally, we were offered the option of sharing a suite with another couple we had never met before, who were in precisely the same predicament as we were. The room we were given for our first night was quite frankly a disgrace and looked nothing like the pictures on the website, or brochure that we saw - we can only assume these images were of the penthouse suite. The room was dirty, worn, badly in need of redecoration, the bed sheets had not been ironed and looked creased and possibly slept in (!?) the bathroom was cramped and again looked unclean and to top it off the pipes banged throughout the night making sleep virtually impossible. The following morning we got up and resolved to make the best of our situation, after all, the room would have been sorted and we had our tour to look forward to. On meeting our rep in the lobby she presented us with the TC booking reference and assured us that by simply showing this at reception a room would be found for us. Alas, this was not the case the Welington's manager said it was not their booking reference and their was no reference of us on their system. As such he could only guarantee us accommodation for another night and then by taking a copy of our credit card. We then spoke to the TC rep, afterall she would be able to speak to the manager and either arrange a return flight home or alternate accommodation. At least that is what we though a TC rep would do...but of course she doesn't work for TC and as such "emphathised with our situation but had done all she could...." With no help from the rep and no help from the Hotel Manager, we asked to make a phone call to TC in the UK. Obviously the hotel would allow us to dial TC or our rep would provide us with the faclities to do so...but NO! We had to pay to call the UK, no phone was provided for us, instead we had to use a combination of our mobile phone and phone cards. With the situation unresolved we were then unable to go on our booked tour (as to do so would mean all UK offices would have been closed and we would have been trusting in the compentency of the Hotel staff to resolve everything by our return). After speaking to the UK and wasting an entire morning, buying phone cards, using public phones, and being passed from pillar to post, the Hotel Manager then phoned us to say he had been able to arrange for a King Size Room - an upgrade...this was after having been told that no rooms were available. I would just like to stress at this point that not once were we offered an apology and we found both the TC rep and hotel staff to be rude and unfriendly. We then had to move our bags from our old room to the new one. The Kingsize room was OK, but not what you would expect from a supposed superior option. It was essentially the same as our previous room but larger, with a slightly less frequent melody coming from the pipes. Our holiday then improved as we spent the vast majority of our time out and about and as far away from the Hotel as possible. Our transfer back to the JFK airport from the hotel went fairly smoothly, until check in at the airport where no record was found of any of our parties bookings. Therefore not everyone was able to be booked onto the flight and had to be diverted to Heathrow. Hardly, the perfect end to your holiday and not what you want after about 12 hours of travelling. We will be seeking appropriate compensation from TC for the shambles we experienced and will update this review with the outcome. To sum up - New York is an amazing city and really is a must to experience, however if you do go - don't use Thomas Cook and certainly do not stay at The Wellington.The sangria's - watered down.I initially booked a room at this hotel because I thought its location would be ideal since it is in close proximity to the Paddington tube station, and in fact that turned out to be the only positive outcome from my stay there. The hotel appears lovely from outside and the lobby is quite nice, too, but on the first night there I was waiting to check in and I received an omen that I was about to experience an awful stay. A couple there was complaining about how they had requested coffee 48 hours ago and they had called several times to remind the concierge but no one did anything about it. It was obvious that they were upset and the concierge really did nothing to help them out, it seemed he couldn't care less. He wouldn't answer them when they asked for the manager's name, nor would he give them a contact number. The couple was enraged and they left fuming. I thought at first that maybe it was just them but then that same night I discovered that we didn't have a blowdryer so I went to the front desk to request one and the concierge there said there wasn't one available because all the rooms were booked at the moment and he would need to wait until someone had left the next morning so that I could have one then. I found that hard to believe but went along with it. So I called the next morning around 6:30 and asked for the blowdryer. I was told then that they would deliver one to my room in 15 minutes. Half an hour passed by and there was still no sign of the blowdryer so I called again and this time another person answered and he told me that it's "in the drawer"...I asked which drawer, and he continued to be vague so I just hung up. It turns out that it was in the dresser drawer right beneath the TV (which by the way didn't even work properly) but I couldn't understand why I wasn't told that the other night when I initially asked for it. Anyway, we had this other problem with the staff there. Besides the fact that most of them 1) were rude and disrespectful and 2) were totally incompetent, it seems that they actually went out of their way to make our stay difficult. We needed a room for one extra night since we were spending part of our vacation in Paris and we were told that we wouldn't have a problem getting a room. The next day, however, when we tried to book something, this other receptionist, a short Indian woman whose name I couldn't catch, told us that we were mistaken, there was nothing available for the night we requested. Obviously we were furious because not only were we given the wrong information the previous night but she did absolutely NOTHING to help us, and her sour expression showed no sign of empathy at all for our situation. We decided to speak to someone else the next day and the assistant manager, Roy, handled the matter but he did put on a very arrogant and snooty attitude. He didn't give us any confirmation of a room but merely signed a letter saying that something was available and that was all. So we came back from Paris and apparently there was a mix-up because they couldn't find anything booked under the cardholder's name (my friend's, who was staying with me) and they told us that they were fully booked for that night so we couldn't stay there. Fortunately, we were able to get assistance from the manager there who was really a blessing. If it weren't for him we would have been left with no place to stay our last night in London. Not only was he corteous and kind but he also went out of his way to do what he could for us. It turned out that the room was booked under my name although it would have saved us a lot of time and trouble if Roy had told us that to begin with, but anyway, we got to stay at this 4 star hotel instead of at Paddington for the same rate that was promised to us, so in that sense we lucked out. Even our transportation to the other hotel was provided for us thanks to the manager (I can't remember his name because I lost the business card but I think it was something like Peader; he had a slim build, average height, and red hair). Really, I can't fully express just how terrible the service was at this hotel and the manager was the only person who stood out as someone who cared about the customers. If you can settle with bad service then stay there because it is in a good location but I would rather stay somewhere else that has a nice and friendly staff. I'll admit that the rooms were decent but still small, and the TV gave us problems (it wouldn't turn on at times). Overall, I would have to say that it's really not worth it to stay at this hotel because it will ruin your trip by making you disgruntled twoards Londoners thanks to the poor service and attitude at the BWPCH.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.Too Large for Personalized Service. Terrible Food, terrible service We stayed at this resort over the Christmas holidays from December 21 to December 28, 2007 鈥?room 65109. The hotel lobby was very nice and clean - check in went very smoothly with no hitches. Staff was polite at check in. We were given a map and that was it. No schedule of activities, no information on booking reservations in restaurants. The extra things that you paid for as part of your package. For us, thank God we had trip advisor. We had done our research.This hotel has several sections and not all packages are not allowed to enjoy all of the amenities. You just wander into a pool area and someone comes up to you and tells you to leave. I saw it happen to several guests. Some instructions at check in can prevent this.Ok - good things then. Property - The property is quite nice. Landscaping is good (not breathtaking) and the resort is kept very clean. This is a big plus given that there are almost 70 buildings at this resort, each with about 18 rooms each. We did a back of the napkin calculation and came up with about 7,000 people at this resort at full occupancy over the Christmas period. They kept people waiting to eat on Christmas dinner night and had to send folks to the upgraded Premier area just to accommodate them, a real nuisance for those who actually paid for the upgrade.Beach - The beach and ocean are just beautiful. The ocean is beautiful and very nice to swim in - no shells, no rocks - just beautiful miles of white sand. This was the biggest plus on this vacation. There is plenty of shade on the beach BUT to get a lounge chair, you had to be out there to reserve one with your towel by 8am in the morning. A real downer for vacationers. The beach also allowed topless so there was a lot of that.Rooms - The rooms were comfortable and very clean. We stayed in the AMBAR section as an upgrade. Bed was average (no Westin beds here) but comfortable. Air conditioner worked great. Bathroom was nice and clean with rain head showers. Lighting was terrible in the rooms. I would say the rooms and furnishings are about 3 Star level.Now for the areas needing improvement (lots of it)Food - At about 7,000 people, the place starts to feel like a campus instead of a resort and the food takes on a cafeteria quality. The food was terrible and often cold. The cooks were very sloppy in preparing your meals (e.g., omelettes etc). You could not trust the salads; they always had lots of water at the bottom of the pan. We found that the food at the beach was much much better and was at least warm. We had roast chicken, burgers, and fries on most days. Those were the only hot items. You have to love pork to enjoy the DR. There is lots of it and not too bad either. We wished they had more local food - maybe it would have been better prepared. The cooks (not chefs) did not seem to have a clue. If food is important on your vacation - rule out this resort. That said, we did get sent over to the premier section for Christmas dinner due to the overflow. The food was ok there - so I guess if you pay the big bucks, you can get ok food - even if it is not great. We did visit the reserved restaurants and found that they just had a set menu. Everything is pre-made and just brought out from the fridge to the table - cold plate and all. None of the restaurants were great but the French - The Gourmet was better than the others we tried.Service 鈥?There is no personalized service here. You get the sense that the employees here are not happy (or treated well) and it comes through in the service. No one really stretches themselves to provide good service. They are polite but not necessarily pleasant. Here are some examples, when our family and friends tried to call us; they were transferred around for 5-15 minutes before connecting them to our room. While sleeping one night, we heard what sounded like running water. It was our ceiling leaking from the floor above. We called the front desk and after being transferred around at 4am because each person we spoke to said 鈥淭hat鈥檚 not my job鈥? no one ever came to check out the leak. The employees would easily tell you it's not their job to get something done and point you to someone else who says the same. I get the sense the employees are not really empowered here. We were a black family traveling and we also found that we received discriminatory service from the staff, e.g., skipping us in line and taking the white folks behind us or having to call waiters to come and serve our table. There were four of us and we all experienced this at different points of our stay. Apparently, there is some history with dark skinned black people in the DR. There seemed to be less than 20 black people at this resort of about 7000 people 鈥?rather strange. Anyway, we did not let that spoil our holiday but we will not go back there.Getting around the resort - you have to take a shuttle if you don't want to walk (about 5-10 minute walk) to get around the resort especially from the beach to the main dining areas. The great thing is that once you get a hang of getting around the resort, it does not seem so huge anymore.Nightly shows and entertainment - They had the staged shows (as all resorts do) which were very very average and below. They tried to put on French Cabaret and other western shows e.g., Lion King- of course - oddly interpreted. This is like making dinner for a bunch of chefs since most of the guests there were Europeans or Americans. They had a mini-circus one night, which was very good. They would have been better off showing off the Latin culture, which is very rich, vibrant and fun. They also have a nightly live band that does a mix of imitating western ballads etc 鈥?very poorly 鈥?the singers were reading the words while performing 飦?You see, the same set of staff organize the daytime events 鈥?volleyball etc and dance at the show, then sing in the live band, and then dance with guests at the nightclub. Something鈥檚 got to give and it鈥檚 the quality that goes. The nightclub was excellent 鈥?really good music 鈥?meringue, salsa, hip hop, pop, and techno 鈥?something for everyone. We never tried the casino. We missed a lot of the daytime events like beach volleyball and other games because we did not have a schedule until 3 days into our vacation. All in all, we will not return to this resort and probably not go back to the DR. I don鈥檛 recommend Gran Bahia Principe 鈥?not enough value for the money. Of course, this is only one review of many on Trip Advisor and individual experiences do differ.We stayed at the Crowne Plaza in San Diego's Mission Valley on Sunday, Aug. 31, 2008 and we will NEVER stay there again! Unlike some of the other reviewers, I felt the rooms were well-decorated - our room had framed floral prints on the walls - the bed was new and the linens were expensive. The carpet had a brown and gold checkered pattern and was new-ish and clean - and, yes, we checked to make CERTAIN the floors/carpets were clean after reading the other reviews. Even more important, the bathrooms were clean as well. There was no mildew in the bath/shower and the shower curtain hangs on a convex rod that keeps it from touching you during a shower. Fine. The vanity and floors were of the same matching tile - heavy, modern stuff. The vanity had two sinks - always a plus for my partner and me - it makes getting out in the mornings much more efficient. The free shower soaps and shampoos were of high quality and the towels were plush enough. The room (Room 1337 BTW) seemed to be recently renovated or was simply well-maintained. Not at all unpleasant. All of the above goes in the "plus" category. However, in the "minus" category: The hotel tries for a faux tropical feel (read: Hawaiian tat) but it is a very sad attempt at a theme that simply does not work. It is filled with poorly done (very perfunctory) water features - tacky, tacky, tacky - and the odd, sad, faded, captive coi that seemed to call out, "Save me, kind sir, for God's sake end my misery." Ugh! One of the elevators was out. Really? On a holiday weekend? The real negative stuff started when we found that the hotel is built on large eight-story high horseshoe shaped courtyard. Not good! Every door that closed - no I got that wrong - EVERY DOOR THAT WAS SLAMMED SHUT and slammed shut EVERY TIME the doors were closed reverberated in our room like a cannon being fired. It was astounding the amount of noise that was generated and the number of booms we heard from these slamming doors - there were hundreds of them! HUNDREDS! Especially on Sunday morning! Yes, many other reviewers mention this fact - but take my word for this - I have NEVER experienced such a cacophony - I kept shouting, "Incoming! and "Take Cover!" Wow! We went to San Diego because we have a season subscription at LaJolla Playhouse. We go to get away from the noise and pace of Los Angeles - not to attempt to relax in the middle of a reenactment of the Civil War. When we went out on the balcony and saw the state of the facilities and were not pleased at all. We were on the third floor overlooking the swimming pool. On either side of our balcony was the top of some sort of supporting structure or perhaps storage units. No matter, they are covered with ugly broken wooden lattices - they must have been new at some point - perhaps back in the early 1990s - now they are broken and junky and should be scrapped. There is trash and TOWELS that have been dropped from the floors above collected in these lattices and it is simply a mess. Ugh - again! It appears that the Management at the Crowne Plaza does only what is required and does not choose to go that little extra distance or put in that little extra effort to make a guest's stay NICE. Isn't NICE the goal? Well it oughta be! It doesn't have to be perfect - just NICE! Now on to the worst aspect of the place. The smoking! We cannot abide smoky hotel rooms and will move to another hotel instead of staying in a room that has been infused with cigarette smoke. One reason we chose the Crowne Plaza was that the entire wing we were in was SUPPOSED to be non-smoking. THAT IS A LAUGH! When we entered the room, I remarked that the place smelled like a hotel room - fresh linen - recently cleaned - you know, like a non-smoking hotel room usually smells - no smoke at all. So far so good. We WERE a bit put off by the "survival kit" that was on the bed when we entered though. Other reviewers have mentioned this "kit" but I will reiterate - it contains three very tell-tale objects. Ear-plugs - oh no! - a sleep mask to cover your eyes - say it ain't so! - and finally a tiny spray bottle of lilac linen freshener - huh? Well, I suppose that the first two items are self-explanatory - too much noise (see the report from the front-lines above) and too much light - although I did not find there was too much light in the room - and there was a drape clip attached to the drape pull that made keeping the light out a snap. (Perhaps this is for people whose closet lights will not go off - as mentioned in other reviews.) But as for the third item (the spray) it was not until late at night that we finally got it. Right in the kisser! Yes, our wing was non-smoking - the floors above us and below were non-smoking - but somebody, somewhere was smoking in that hotel - SEVERAL SOMBODIES IN FACT! Our room filled with noxious cigarette smoke at regular intervals ALL NIGHT LONG and it worsened in the morning when all those smokers somewhere in the Crowne Plaza (AND MY PARTNER AND I) - EVEN THOUGH WE *DON'T* SMOKE!!! - partook of that first cigarette of the day! Jeez! We needed gas masks (to maintain up the battlefield motif of this review.) Why claim non-smoking rooms at all when it is obvious that the air-conditioning or ventilation system is so poorly engineered that is simply sucks all the smoke from other parts of the hotel into your room anyway! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE and another reason we will NEVER stay at the Crowne Plaza again. And let me assure you that tiny bottle of lilac linen spray is not sufficient to combat the onslaught of smoke. If only that were possible! A few other ideas in response to some of the other reviewers comments. The lights in our lighted closets DID do out when the doors were closed, so we did not have to contend with that. And I agree with some of the other reviewers - the safes are laughably small. About a foot wide and perhaps two inches deep. "Really? Really? Then you try to get your valuables in there!" And I don't travel with many valuables. Ludicrous! I found the staff friendly enough - unlike some of the other reviewers. The parking costs $12.00 for a 24-hour period and had in/out privileges. Pretty standard. The exhaust fan in the bathroom did not draw and the room stayed steamy all morning - why?, why? Why ask why? Towels are provided at pool side. Very good. And there is a separate area for sun-bathers away from the pool itself. VERY GOOD! But I felt the pool was under-chlorinated (dangerous) and it was filled with dead insects - it needed to be skimmed. We got out when someone in the pool suggested it was filled with salt water. It was simply under-chlorinated so it did not seem like most other "public" pools that one experiences! Ugh - a third time! Skip this place if you are able. We got a deal on Hotwire that I feel was not worth it in hindsight. There are so many choices in Mission Valley as well as LaJolla and San Diego and environs - surely there are better hotels that the Crowne Plaza!Would not return for the amount we paid.Anyway, the owner was fake.Well, it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks, and then tells us to chill out.I can't believe that Best Western put their name on this hotel. The location in the Latin Quarter is good if you like a lot of action. The car horns (and the French seem to love their horns) are plentiful along with the general sounds of masses of people on St. Michel Blvd. Its proximity to the colleges makes it quite the hangout area so could be fun all through the night if you don't mind the noise. I had to wear ear plugs. There are some pros to the place. It is clean (I checked for bed bugs), has free WiFi along with a guest computer, beverages stocked in the mini-fridge and includes a minimal breakfast (which was served in what seemed like a dungeon -- two small basement rooms encased by rock). There is complimentary happy-hour wine in the lobby. It seems like a very safe area although there was an incident on the last morning when a very aggressive bag lady came into the lobby and was stuffing the hotel's snack items into her cargo pants. When she was asked to leave, she caused quite a scene complete with cussing and spitting. The desk clerk (didn't get his name but he was the nicer one) tried to lock her out but the front doors weren't working, which leads me to the elevator. When we arrived, the elevator worked but is small beyond belief. It fit two suitcases and the two of us and THAT IS IT. If we had a small child with us, he would have had to be held or put on top of the luggage. The rest of the time, the elevator worked intermittently so we walked several trips to/from the 4th floor. We were offered the service elevator which is a cylinder in a dark cage that can only fit one to two people. We chose the stairs. Upon arrival, I took one look at the room and went back to the desk and asked if that was what we were supposed to get. I was informed that my travel agent booked a standard room (at the mere price of $276/night US dollars). This room looked nothing like the picture on Best Western's site. NOTHING. I measured because it was so ridiculous. I know that rooms in Paris can be tight but I had never seen a hotel room this small in my life, and I've traveled a lot. Give or take an inch, here are the sizes: bedroom 9'x10', bathroom 4'9"x5'7" including a shower of 29"x29". Every time I turned around in the shower, I turned the water off because I couldn't help but hit the handle. The closet is actually laughable, 16"x19". There is no dresser, just some small shelves next to the closet. Because there was no counter space in the bathroom, I used the bedroom radiator to hold my hair curler. In order to open a suitcase, the entry door had to be blocked. We each had one suitcase and only one bag at a time could be horizontal unless you wanted to sleep in the bed with it. And I use the word "sleep" loosely. The double bed was hard as a rock and had there been floor space, I might have opted for it because it might have been cooler. They advertise air conditioning which didn't cool at all. There is a mounted unit at the ceiling in the corner of the room and it gives off a little whiff of air, not cool, not hot, just air. The french doors (no balcony) couldn't be left open because of the noise. The room came with two bath towels and two plastic cups; there was a hand towel or two in there also. I needed an extra towel which shouldn't have had to be explained. On our way back in, my husband asked the desk clerk for another towel and perhaps a pillow (because our three were like pancakes). The clerk asked if we already had two towels and I explained that I needed to wash my hair so needed an extra. None of his business why I needed one but I offered the justification. The clerk showed his dissatisfaction but came back with a towel a couple of minutes later. My husband then asked again about getting another pillow. The clerk got pretty snippy telling my husband that he should have asked for it when he requested the towel. Hubby did! We hiked up the stairs (elevator not working) and passed a maid in the hallway with an open closet door with several pillows lined up. We asked if we could have one and she obliged. I should mention here that the hotel book in our room states that "if you need anything, just ask." Really?? We had another instance with this same clerk but enough about him. I doubt that all Latin Quarter rooms are like this so I would look harder if you are set on staying there. Saint-Germain-des-Pres is the next neighborhood over. It seems a bit quieter and in just as good of location. On the west side, at the end of the Metro lines, you can get 4-star hotels for decent prices (Paris decent prices anyways). I've stayed at both the Renaissance La Defense and the Evergreen Laurel, both worlds apart from this place. If you choose to stay at the Best Western Belloy St. Germain, well, I warned you!Horrible Experience, Rude Staff, Not at ALL worth it.... This was my first experience using travelocity and decided to take a chance and book a little getaway for the Labor Day weekend. Since I used to live in SF and travel their quite frequently for work, I am quite familiar with the city and knew we would want to stay in union square (as my boyfriend has never been there and this is the best touristy spot). I usually prefer to stay at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin St. Francis but both were overbooked. I was left with the Clift and Hotel Nikko. I definiately made the wrong choice even though I had heard good things about the lounge and restaurant. Since I have stayed at the Morgan (NYC) several times I assumed we would have a pleasant experience and I LOVE Asia de Cuba in NYC. I was wrong!  When we arrived at the Clift, the doorman did not even open the door or even aknowledge our pressence. Check-in was smooth but the girl was certainly rushing us and annoyed with any questions. Our original plan was to spend our first night with dinner at Asia De Cuba and start off with some early evening cocktails at the Redwood Room. BIG MISTAKE. Upon check-in we asked if we needed reservations for the Redwood Room. The girl gave us some preferred customer cards of some sort which she explained would get us right in with no problem. We approached the hostess at about 730 pm. There were a couple of guys in front of us whom the hostess was assisting. As we patiently waited, a large group came up behind us. The matron of the group approached the hostess - cutting in front of everyone else AND interrupting the conversation between the hostess and the 2 guys. Rather than telling this RUDE woman to go stand in line actually assisted her! The guys in front of us looked apalled and we were infuriated. Once it was finally our turn (like that mattered to the hostess) she very rudely told us we couldnt come in without a reservation. She said she had people arriving at 9 pm. We explained we just wanted ONE pre-dinner cocktail. At this point she got even more rude. At this point we decided this was NOT a place we wanted to spend out money anyways. They obviously dont care about their actual guests! The scene was horrible anyways. I dont think there was a patron under the age of 65 in the entire bar.... so much for a hip bar scene. We tried to complain to a manager but he was too busy having a personal conversation with one of the doormen. We decided our money is better spent elsewhere and opted against dinner in the hotel. We had a lovely meal in the Marina district then went on to drinks at Matrix where our patronage was appreciated and our drinks were not accompanied with a side of rudeness. I might also point out the martinis are $8 at Matrix as opposed to the overpriced drinks Redwood Room with serve you along with their snooty attitude. We are from LA so we are no strangers to attitude but this was just plain RUDE.  Aside from the horrible experience our first night, the hotel lobby is quite nice. The rooms are VERY small and somewhat dirty. The bathroom is appalling - dirty towels, the fan doesnt work, no standing room. On our final day, the anger from night one had worn off slightly (probably because we spent as little time in the hotel as possible). We were packing our stuff and relaxing from a morning of shopping. The day before, housekeeping entered our room even though we had the do not disturb sign on the door. Since nothing was taken we ignored it. Now here we are, a mere hour from escaping the Clift, when there is a knock at the door...housekeeping. I explain we are leaving at 1 (check out time) and to please respect the do not disturb sign. 15 minutes later, another knock at the door. It is the housekeeper AGAIN. I tell her we are still here and remind her of our departure time. Sure enough, another knock at the door and who could it be? The SAME housekeeper. At this point we are so frustrated my boyfriend tells her to wait outside and we gather all our stuff (half packed and all). They clearly wanted us gone so we sprinted to the elevator checked out and left the Clift behind.  Trust me, the Clift offers NOTHING to validate such horrible attitudes and behavior. I had high hopes for this place and if they had impressed me, I would have considered staying there on my monthly business trips up to SF. Forget it. I will definately tell everyone I know NOT to stay here and I will probably never stay at the Morgan again either just because of the Clift affiliation. Trust me, you are better off at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin. At least they know you exist there and are gracious for your patronage. My advice to the Clift, perhaps you should remember that you are serving your guests not vice versa. Thank you for putting a stain on an otherwise lovely trip.the two waitress's looked like they had been sucking on lemons.I don't know who has been reviewing this resort but they obviously don't have any taste. Let me first say that don't expect to have any assistance from the second you arrive it's totally a fend for yourself resort and you feel like we got you now so go away and don't bother me. We stayed in the Platinum Suites, you would think since you are paying for that you would have assistance with your luggage and to you room, but that's not the case. Keep an eye on your luggage because they are so confused that they lost our friends luggage to another room. They give you a property map and you figure it our. Don't worry, you actually have electricity and if someone would have explained your room to you you would have known. You have to put your card in the slot to turn on anything. Don't use your room key because housekeeping will take it. Use a couple business cards and leave them in there all the time. Check the air conditioning because housekeeping will turn it up on you. Make sure you take all your toiletries because what they supply to you is ridiculous. They give you shampoo/body wash all in one, no conditioner, a shoe polisher, no q-tips, toothbrush/toothpaste, baby tissues and a bar of soap. You will have to leave notes to housekeeping about leaving toiletries and towels and wash clothes because half the time they take them and won't leave them. Be prepared to live out of your suitcase becuase there are no dressers in the room and surely not enough hangers to hang half your clothes. Don't use too many things at one time because you will loose electricity. My husband was in the jacuzzi tub and I was drying my hair and the electricity went out and they said we couldn't use that much electricity at one time. Be prepared to drink warm water and soda from the refrigerator because it didn't work in either of our rooms. The items they say you are supposed to get in your room are a joke. One room got a fruit basket, a couple bottles of alcohol and bag and the other room got nothing. I went to concierge and they said that it was not required in the rooms. We never got the fruit, my 7 year old complained about not getting a bag and finally got one and we never had any liquor in our room. The refrigerator is filled with 3 bottles of water, 2 Pepsi, 1 orange soda, 1 club soda and 3 beers. The pool at the platinum is a baby pool. Being in the platinum you are so inconvenienced that you have to go all around everything. There are no areas to get into the platinum rooms other then going around the backside of a restaurant. You are totally shoved in a corner and surrounded by swamp waters. They have alligators on the property. TAKE BUG SPRAY. Check all the toilets before you sit down because half the time there is no toilet paper. Don't expect to know what's going on at the resort because even the concierge doesn't know. They don't give you any itinerary at all. The concierge really have the same feeling as the front desk. What do you want and go away. The Sports bar is a dump and the pool tables were falling apart and no tips on the sticks. Book your dinner reservations by 3:00 because "their computers" don't allow for any changes after 3:00. Make reservations and pay for Chill Out because that's the best part of this resort. The spa is a waste of money. I could hear all the activities going on outside and it was not relaxing at all and smelled like dirty gym socks. You'll have to ask to go into the hydrotherapy because they don't offer or even take you in and explain anything. They say it's through "that door". The tram that is supposed to be for the Platinum guests are available to anyone and takes forever and there is only one that runs up and down the entire length of the resort. Don't bother with following the dress code for the restaurants because they don't really care. It's a total free for all. The restaurants are not separate they are connected in twos so there really isn't any intimacy. The menus look awesome but the food was lacking. Some of the restaurants don't even have everything that's on the menus. If you plan on ordering wines from the list, at an extra cost, be prepared to choose 4 bottles because they may have 1 out of the 4 available even though there are a bunch on the list. Take your tennis shoes because nothing is convenient. They have one show each night at 8:00 in the courtyard between the two lobbies and if you don't get there early and save seats you're screwed. The second show is at 9:30 and you are in a theatre with about 500 people. Thank goodness they had a bar in the theatre to tolerate the shows. They have reserved places on the beach that you have to pay for. They have vendors that have payed for parts of their beach and if you want to seat beach front you have to pay. There is a "very small" section for platinum guests only, but don't blink you will miss it and if you are staying on the sunset side you have to walk completely to the other side of the resort to find it. Be prepared to be heckled with, do you want to by sunglasses and let me take your pictures. The ocean is so rocky it hurts to get in and out of the water. I asked a staff member and he said it's becuase it's close to a reef and that's all the pieces breaking off the reef and drifting ashore. Make sure you keep track of your towels because you have towel cards and have to turn your towels in and get cards but be careful because on the beach and at the pools there are only certain times you can get your towels or exchange them. The platinum part of the beach area sometimes has towels, but if you walk all the way over there and they don't have them you are screwed. The majority of the restaurants close between breafast, lunch and dinner so make sure you check the times becuase if you miss it then you have to go all the way to the main lobby to go to the main buffet. Keep an eye on everything you eat because even though we were cautious with the water and what we ate my husband still got food poisoning. You have to call the bell hop atleast 1 hour before you want your luggage picked up, but don't expect them to come and get them. We waited over an hour and they never showed up. Our transportation was waiting for us in the lobby so we have to pull all our luggage and carryons up to the lobby. We have 2 children, 7 and 10 and they were almost in tears with that treck with dragging their luggage from the far end of the resort. None of the staff offered to help or even page someone to come and help us. We go to Mexico every year for a family vacation and I would never recommend this resort to anyone or will I ever stay here even if it were free!My expectation of Encore by Wynn was that it is an exceptional hotel associated with another exceptional hotel. Well it tuened out to be more like a wolf in sheeps clothing. Check in was quick and fine and we got a room on the 38th floor and could have paid an extra $25 per night to get a higher hotel room. The room was plush and the bathroom was as big as the rest of the room. First thing I noticed as I checked the room out was that it had a lot of wasted space. It had a large what I thought was a dresser, but turned out to be just a display. It had no drawers and you couldn't open it. It also had a couple of more places you would think they would allow you to store things that were no more than cosmetics. I still thought the room was fine until I tried to turn on the big screen tv and it didn't work. That was my first call to the service desk. While waiting for them to arrive I noticed they had a collection of snacks and gifts sitting on the dresser thing. Well these were balanced on a device that if you removed any item you had 60 seconds to replace it otherwise you will be charged for it. This probably wouldn't be a big deal unless you wanted to read the contents of whatever it was. Speed reading anyone!!! Also noticed that there was no refrigerator. This prompted our second call to the service desk. Turns out you could rent on for $25 dollars a day. Hummm, that works out to $175 for a week. Fortunate for us the hotel is within walking distance of a Walgreen where we went a got a disposable ice chest and other goodies to tide us over for our 3 night stay. They came up and got the tv working and we were ready to dive into the casino and other offering of the hotel. The gaming is your usual slots and table games that all hotels offer. The place had several restaurants with the most intreging being the Sinatra. Decent prices for a high end Italian restaurant. The other restaurants were just over priced. The Encore is attached to the Wynn so you can go there as well but the two places are the same in decor and amenities. After a long drive to get to Vegas we called it an early night (about 12 midnight). The next day everything changed. I checked by checking account like I do everyday and found that $850 dollars had been charged to my account. I wanted to know what this was and it turns out that the hotel had charged me for the nights I was staying and they had an incidentals charge of $150 per night that was deducted from my account. Now I don't know about you but I have never stayed in a hotel that charged for the room upfront and most incidentals were either I take you card number or about a $100 refundable deposit. I asked why the incidental charge was so much and the responde was "we don't know it you will destroy the room or not". Excuse me, but what type of guests do you have it you think they will destroy the room. That sheds a bad light on the hotel. We inquired about an alternative to the incidental charge that they had taken out of my account and they had none. Personally I think tying up the amount of money they were tying up was taking away from us enjoying what the hotel had to offer. Not everyone uses credit , so of us pay as we go. This whole incident led us to not want to spend any more money in this hotel, so the remainder of the trip we eat and gambled elsewhere. But that wasn't the end of out problems. We returned to our room after one excusion and our toilet didn't work and another the electricity in the room didn't work. Needless to say we wern't happy campers at this hotel. The kicker came the morning of checkout. Part of the package deal we got from the hotel was a $75 dollar credit with the hotel. We hadn't used any of it so we decided to hit the pool early and then have breakfast by using this. The pool area is wonderful at this hotel. They have a regular pool and they have an adults only pool for those who want to go european style. Cabanas go for $300 to $400 dollars a day through the week and $400 to $500 a day for the weekend. The cabana is yours for the entire day, so you could leave and comeback later in the day. Well we charge a couple of bloody maria's while at the pool and then went to breakfast. Well when we tried to charge the breakfast on the room we were informed that we had checked out of the room already. It also turned out that the drinks we thought we had charged did not count either. So we ended up spending close to $70 dollars that we could have spent somewhere else. It was a very frustrating situation. How did we get checked out without our knowledge? The explaination from the hotel was that the hotel must have automatically checked us out. What? How does a hotel automatically check you out? We hadn't even went back to the room to get out stuff. What the heck!!! Well when we really did go down to get the explaination it wasn't pretty. Our complaints were so much that they had to pull us out of line and the hotel manager talked to us on the side. Turns out that they also have a policy of letting hotel personnel use each others name tags. The person who checked us into the hotel that didn't tell us about the incidentals or the upfront room charge had been using someone elses name tag. So the hotel couldn't identify who had checked us in. There was also different solutions to the incidental charge that could have been used. On top of all this when we were ready to leave the hotel we had our luggage sent to the valet parking and they lost our luggage. We had to wait in valet for almost 45 minutes before we could go. Also turns out that we were not the only ones who had a problem or two. Overall the experience was a total failure on the hotels part. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. As a matter of fact I would recommend that anyone looking for a great experience to go to the Pallazo and Veneitian hotel for a lot better experience.The magnificient view of the infinity pool & the SkyPark is the only reason to stay in this property. Only hotel guests can go to the pool, make a short stay in MBS then move elsewhere. I agree with many posters, impersonal 1-star chaotic service. The hardware of the hotel is ok. To sum up it – SERVICE is poor, you pay for the pool and skypark experience, stay short then move elsewhere for much quality service and hardware in town. Free airport shuttle - at every 30mins. proceed to the COACH area at Changi airport. Business center ~ we later found out guest/room (not sure) can have up to 3 hours of internet I presume per stay. It is not 24 hours. CHECK IN~~ the worst experience in my travel life. The check-in area in the lobby floor traversing the 3 towers is like a zoo. No clear signage for check-in desk. I asked the staff floating in the lobby where to check-in, but I was told to ask myself. WOW, what a service Later we found out there were 3 check-in desks in the lobby the pm we arrived. We line-up for more than 50mins. So little staff. The hug hotels in Vegas handle more check-in guests, but service was swift. The management needs to seriously rectify this problem. Staff did NOT inform us of business center, laser show nor any other facilities or service. NO info in rooms as well. Below par. BELL Serivce ~~ IF you are not SUPER VIP don't expect efficient Bell service like in Japan other Asian hotels. ROOM - I believe rooms in Tower 1&2 are better/higher grade room for they are with balcony but outside corridor. We were in an end unit in Tower 3, with a sweeping view of the city and Marina Bay. It is only a 14-mth old hotel, but wear&tear shown in the furniture and fixture. What a shame! Housekeeping work is under-par. There is a electricity socket compartment on the desk which is really good comparing with many hotel rooms are so short of AC sockets. BUT it was filled with digusting dust and crumbs… NO map/floor plan of the hotel and the adjacent Shoppe/Casino complex. No info on business center, internet charge (S$30/day) nor shuttle service to airport. The carpet is not clean, I spotted multiple debris in it, for I never heard the housekeeping staff vaccum throughout the day he works on the floor while we walked in and out frequently. I doubt the carpet is cleaned regularly. Water/soap stain on the faucet. There was a filthy white tissue or paper stuck on the stainless steel toilet roll cover, I just forgot to take a photo of it. Filthy.... The management should demand the staff for detailed (not to say meticulous) housekeeping work!!!! Bathrobes, slippers are good. Tea/Coffee making facilities are quality. The aircon was not working properly with a drooming sound at night. Room temp was at 26C. We had to call a technician. Room Service ~ not swift, but the food was fairly good given it was in the middle of the night. Mid-night menu was very limited, Hainan Chicken Rice was not even on the menu for midnight service. *-* Restaurant s ~~ If your room package includes breakfast , esp your stay includes a weekend, go to Rise the restaurant to line up early. It was like a circus. CHAOTIC is the word. If it is not complimentary , enjoy a more relaxing breakfast elsewhere. The food was general. We line-up for 30mins for a table, briefly settle in a table , upon we return from getting food from the buffet, our table was cleared, Oh, My!!!! The small card w our room # & info was still in the glass indicating the table is occupied. Restaurant Manager should have better management and training to staff. Sky57 on the topfloor observation floor was not impressive, I assume it is more fine dining. But it is a sitdown fastfood. Terrible. Osteria Mozza ~Italian restaurant in the Shoppe (the adjacent mall) , stone-oven pizza is good. Overall the service in the gift or cake shop in the lobby area is unattentive. I walked away 3 times from the cake shop for the staff all clustered at the back of the shop, despite I stood there for more than 7-10 mins patiently. Are they too busy?? Not really. CONCIERGE ~ not very knowledgeable, they only suggest restaurants & service in the hotel and adjacent mall. POOL, SKYPARK & OBSERVATION DECK ~ The HIGHLIGHT the reason you stay here. Spend most of your time in the infinity pool, enjoy the panoramic day and night view which soothe us out to forget all the flaws of the other area of the hotel. Poolside F&B is very general but service is swift. Drinks are below par. CASINO ~ Bring your passport, you need it like going through immigration in and out (~) the lower floor is smoking. Upper floor is non-smoking. Dealers do not look very enthusiastic like other casinos in Vegas. We used to stay Fullerton then switch to St. Regis, but there are loads of chaos and problems that MBS need to rectify and improve .Just returned from Sandos Caracol and Spa, March 11, 2006!!!! My partner and I, plus 4 others just returned from Sandos Caracol and Spa in the Riviera Maya. DO NOT GO!!! If you have reservations there- cancel them asap. This place is the worst. When our bus left the highway into the resort we already knew we were in trouble when there was no lit up sign for the place and we rode down about a 2 mile dirt road in complete darkness. Once at the hotel lobby, it didn't look bad, so like everyone else we all checked in. Once we got to our rooms, the realization hit us. There was no hot water, the toilet would not flush, the shower stall had about 2" of water/sewage sitting in the bottom. The window and patio door had no screens and we were in the middle of the jungle. The air conditioning??? There were only 3 wires coming out of the wall where the thermostat was supposed to be. The floors were dirty and so we asked our friends how their rooms were. One seemed ok; the other also had no air conditioning and no screens on their windows. We went back to the hotel and they said they'd fix everything in the morning. The next morning we woke up and my partner had bug bites all over his legs. On the way up to the lobby we ran into some others and their comments were, 'do you have hot water? does your toilet flush, does your air conditioning work, did you get bitten up?' One woman showed us her ankle and it was swollen like she had been hit with a baseball bat. There were about 12 people already up at the hotel lobby and it was only 7:30am. Everyone wanted new rooms. The comment was, come back at 10:00 because the manager isn't in yet. We'd go back at 10 and it was 'oh, the manager just went to a meeting, come back at noon.' We'd go back at noon and the manager was out to lunch....so we'd go back at 3pm. Everyone was getting the same answers, which were NO answers. By now, there were about 30+ people milling around the lobby, all sharing their experiences with the place. A husband and wife on their honeymoon; the bride crying. A couple with 2 little children were told they didn't have a room for them yet...and 2 hours later they were still sitting in the lounge and I could not believe they were being so patient. One man came in and told the manager his card would not open his room door and he was given another card. The second one did not work so a 3rd one was given. At that point the man said to the desk clerk - YOU come with me! Maybe I'm doing something wrong. When the 3rd card would not open his door and no-one seemed anxious to help, he walked around where there was construction going on, found a ladder and climbed into his room through a window. Two women were overheard saying they put their things in the room and when they went to close the door the door knob came off in their hands. The management said for the night to just put their suitcases against the door and they would have someone come up the next day to fix it. Another couple put all their money in their safe and when they went to open it up; it would not work. They tried and tried, then got someone from the front desk and they could not get it open either. We heard that the next day some of the men doing construction there were trying to saw through the safe to open it. The pond (or whatever they called it) had turtles and fish in it but it was nothing but stagnant water that did not move. The room next door to ours was open when we got back to the hotel and I peaked inside to see if that room was any better only to see 2 COCKROACHES scamper across the floor. I screamed and ran. From Saturday, March 4th through Monday, March 6th we were all promised to have rooms. They were playing musical chairs - when one couple complained, they would be moved to another room. It maybe didn't have the air conditioning working; but, there was hot water. Or, you had a toilet that flushed and you were excited. One gal had been moved 3 times to different rooms and they kept getting worse; she finally went back to the first room because that was the best of the 3. The beach was rocky with rubbish and glass on it. Everyone wanted out from the first day there but nothing was done to help us. Of the 7 restaurants and 10 bars that were there only 2 bars and 2 restaurants were open. One bar was open ALL NIGHT LONG with food available- which we now believe was for good reason. If we drank enough we might not complain. By Monday, the lobby was packed and we were sitting on our suitcases saying we wanted out and were not taking no for an answer. When they realized we were not leaving, within an hour there were 2 busses from Apple Vacations (which we had all booked through) taking us to Sandos Gala in Playa del Carmen. Though the place was definitely not a 5 star, it looked like heaven compared to the 3 days of hell we spent at the Sandos Caracol and Spa. The only thing good that came out of this was that we met many people that we probably would not have gotten to know had we not had the one thing in common. And, that was a horrible trip to Mexico. Fortunately, we've been to Mexico 4 or 5 times before and we know that this was NOT the norm. We have never had problems in any place we have ever stayed. But trust me when I say this, if you plan on going to this resort within the next year you had better change your plans or you WILL be sorry. It is currently no more than a 1* rating, if that. It's disgusting and should have been closed down. A special note to all the nice people we met at the hotel - you were all treasures - because we were all in the same boat we could bounce our troubles off of each other and it helped us get through the week. And, at the end, we could even smile again!If you want to lose weight while on vacation, then Punta Cana's the place to go! A group of 12 of us just returned from a week at the Breezes Punta Cana. We had read many reviews before leaving and found them to be 50/50 so decided to wait and judge for ourselves. We have traveled together yearly (mostly on cruises) for quite some time. This was the first all inclusive we had done. By the end of the week we determined this was The Trip From Hell! Our trip was booked last June. When we arrived at the resort we found that the 12 of us were spread from building one through building seven. We spent a lot of time at the check-in desk trying to get us closer together, but as we discovered, the favorite saying of most of the people employed at the Breezes (for the few that could speak any English) is It's not possible. Our rooms ranged from suites to some having a room with two double beds. Some of the people in our party had daily maid service. Some of us had to call and request it and would maybe get it two or three days later. We had all taken little gifts for the maids and left those along with money as a thank you for cleaning our room and taking care of us. Some days the gifts and money remained where we left them. Some in our group had shower problems. One room would run out of water half way through their shower. Several of the rooms had leaky showers and toilets. These were reported but nothing was ever done about it. The sheets on our beds were so pilled that some of us actually got rashes from them. It rained quite a bit while we were there but we also had enough sun. When it rained hard, the hallways would flood as there are no windows in the outside of the resort. The night we were having dinner in Paris (the French Restaurant) the water came flooding into the hallway, into the restaurant and into the elevator. Needless to say, when we were done eating we did not take the elevator. One couple woke up at 3:00am to discover their bedroom floor flooded. When they called the front desk to inquire about it and asked where the water was coming from, the male at the desk said it's coming from the sky! Most of the nightly entertainment was held in an outside amphitheatre so when it rained there was no nightly show. We found the bartenders inside the resort to be very unfriendly but the bartenders in the pool bar and in the A la carte restaurants to be very friendly and accommodating.The food: As everyone else has stated, the whole reservation thing is a mess. Someone from our group stood in line for an hour (she was 5th in line) and when 6:00 came and they started taking reservations, she was told that the first opening would be 9:00. We later learned that some of the resort guests pay cash up front to be able to get reservations for the time they want. We ate at the Japanese restaurant where the cook and waiter were absolutely wonderful and made it very fun. However, whenever I have gone to a Japanese restaurant, you are served the food as it is cooked. At the resort, the chef cooked everything first and at the very end served it up with a lot of it being cold. The wine was endless. My personal favorite was the French restaurant. The meal was fantastic, wine never-ending and the waiters were wonderful. The Mexican Restaurant was great and we loved the atmosphere. However, the hostess was extremely rude and put a damper on the evening. By the time we ate at the Italian Restaurant our last night there, so many of us had been sick that everyone was just picking at their food. We found the daily buffet in the Alcazar to be quite boring - the same thing over and over. Not to mention you have flies and birds flying around while you are eating. Your best bet for breakfast is to have the made before you eyes omelet. The first night we arrived we ate at Marlins - by the pool. I made the mistake of ordering lobster and you do not order lobster elsewhere if you are from Maine. Two bites was enough me me. The people in our group that had steak said it was good but very thin and tough. The afternoon buffet at the Marlin was the best. Hot dogs, burgers, fries, etc.Pool: One of the most fantastic that I have seen and we spent a lot of time in it. There was a bar in the middle and the bartenders were a lot of fun.The ocean is gorgeous and we never had a problem with reserving chairs. The guys in our group especially loved the beach because of the topless women. Keep in mind though that the waves are very strong. I tore my hamstring on the second day there when I got caught in an undertoe. (And unfortunately for me, the elevator to our floor was out of order for three days after). Shopping: We opted not to leave the resort and they had very little to offer in the way of shopping. And what they did have was very expensive.Some in our group went snorkeling which they enjoyed but did say that the area they were in was chained off to keep the sharks out. Some also went parasailing. One even went when it was thundering and lightening. We kept hoping the boat would bring him back but obviously they weren't concerned. OSHA definitely does not exist in the Dominican.Advice to anyone who is adamant about going to Dominican Republic: Be sure to take Malaria pills before going; take lots of Imodium with you as well as an antacid for upset stomachs. We saw some people being wheeled around in a wheel chair with an IV attached. You cannot get diet soda there unless you can convince the staff that you are on a diet.Needless to say, the only thing that saved our vacation was the fact that there were 12 of us together who have been friends forever and we made the best of a bad situation!First of all I want to clarify that we are an average family who loves to travel but tries to save some money when possible. Also, I want to clarify that we spent a lot of nights in non-chain type hotels, so we know how to survive without the standard curved shower curtain, or the standard Hilton Brand alarm on your night stand.... but the experience at At Wind Chimes was so terrible that I really need to talk about it. My wife booked 3 nights at At Wind Chimes 1 month in advance, and when she called the hotel to confirm a crib, she was told that we would be upgraded to the Acacia- wonderful! Call before arriving to know where to check in, they warned her. We got to San Juan, called and found out that the upgrade was fake â€“ back at At Wind Chimes we were! We got to At Wind Chimes. Check in was already troubled by this reverse upgrade, or downgrade. Owner denied any upgrade had ever been offered, and he told us that there are 4 different hotels in San Juan owned by the same owner of the At Wind Chimes. Acacia is right down the road, and is one of these co-owned hotels. Trust me, it is not even in the same category as At Wind Chimes. The look of the hotel is overall Caribbean authentic, at least from the outside. Some renovation was going onâ€¦not very convenient considering the Spring Break period. According to the owner the hotel was full. The swimming pool is in a corner next to the reception.. not very good looking. Not very inviting. Since we were traveling with a 9 month old baby, my wife had called ahead to make sure there was a crib for the baby. Our room at the Acacia was supposed to have a balcony (perfect for when baby went to bed). Our room at At Wind Chimes- not so much. No balcony, no space, very tiny room. We were so disappointed. First of all they asked us to provide the credit card to pay the whole amount. We thought it was for any incidentals, but then we were handed a receipt to sign for another payment. But hey- we already paid in full on Expedia! No, according to At Wind Chimes, we didnâ€™t. (We later checked online- yes of course we had, and we had to repeatedly ask for a refund). Our room was the very last one available (that's what they said). Our room was on the 2nd floor of the 2nd building. After 3 ramps of stairs (no elevator, but they have ground level rooms if you have mobility issues), we finally got to our room. The room was 10' x 10'. Air conditioner under the window 2' from the bed (great for my back...), the room smelled like mold, and it did not look very well cleaned. But the greatest surprise was that the restroom did not have a door (!?!?!) and the window of the bathroom was actually looking at the corridor where all the guests where passing by (the window could not be closed, and we realized quickly that you could hear everything going on in the bathroom from the outside...) The crib was first placed in one position, then moved to another to allow us to access the bed. With the baby, luggage, and us, it was like a puzzle... The smell of mold was still there by the way. Off course there was no balcony eitherâ€¦ so after 7:30 PM, our day was practically over. We had a stained pillow (replaced), dirty towels in the bathroom (replaced). At Wind Chimes really feels more like a hostel than a hotel. Just dirty, unkept and old in general. Internet connection was related to the Boat Bar which is part of the hotel. Connectivity was very poor, and worked only the first day. Speaking of the bar, it was closed for renovation. The carpenters were working from dawn to dusk and everything was happening right in front of our only window. You want to relax in peace, enjoy your time away, have a baby that takes naps? Tough. It was also very noisy with the traffic outside. Remember the window in the bathroom facing the corridor? The corridor has a large opening on the street, that was working as a funnel for all the noises that were easily entering our room every time of the day (and night). The smell of mold was still there by the way.. no matter how low you were trying to keep the air conditioning hoping to reduce the humidity.. it did not work at all. The safety of the room was extremely poor. The same key was opening too many doors... and the lock was very weak. We complained with the owner, but off course the answer was always the same: "We are trying to find you a better room, We are fully booked, We are sorry, but no refunds...". The second day I decided to go with our baby to the swimming pool. As I said the one at At Wind Chimes is not very inviting, but the owner told us that if we want we could go to the sister hotel (the Acacia), I decided to go there to see how it looks. The Acacia is a totally different story. No Smell of Mold (off Course!) and very beautiful. The swimming pool (that is actually a very large hot tub) is on the second floor. Once I saw the hot tub I could not believe that both hotels were actually owned by the same person... The Hot Tub is amazing! It is worth the fare for the hotel just by itself... luckily I found that it is not a real hot tub.. it is just a little bit warm.. Perfect temperature for the baby! We had a wonderful time. I had occasion to look into the rooms facing the pool while the doors where open for the cleaning. They have a big LCD, and very nice paintings. The doors are new, and the lamps are new as well. Very good looking, and very nice style. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, I had to go back to the smell of mold, the small room, and the air conditioning hammering my back all night long. A very good thing of the hotel is the location. You are 5 minutes walk from Kasalta Bakery (wonderful for snacks, breakfast, lunches), and many other small restaurants for the night. 10 minutes to the west, and you are in the center of Condado with hundreds of restaurants and bars. The bus stop is 5 minutes from there. Line #53 will take you straight to the old San Juan (amazing place!). The beach is literally 1 minute walk to the north. You can see the palms or the water at the end of the street. Again, let me reiterate- when I read negative reviews on TripAdvisor, I always think: these people expect too much, they are snobs, etc. However, this is unfortunately my true experience as an absolutely normal person. The level of decency is severely lacking at At Wind Chimes. Of course, as long as you do not like the smell of Mold! In that case, the At Wind Chimes is the perfect place for you! We were very happy to leave the At Wind Chimes to continue out trip around the wonderful island of Puerto Rico.Don't waste your time or your money.We stayed here for Memorial Day Weekend based on a successful Priceline bid of $109.00 per night to stay at a 4 Star Hotel in the Beverly Hills area. We stayed from Friday night through Monday. We asked for a room with two double beds as high as possible and we were placed in Room 1556 which featured a balcony looking west. The room was a fair size. Not large, but not cramped. The beds and linen were low quality and not nearly as nice as beds one would normally find at a true 4 Star property. The bathroom was older in look. The molding around some of the wall tiles was wearing away and the toiletries provided were of a low grade/quality. The shower head was also just a standard, lower grade and the bathroom itself was hardly 4 Star. The room had a medium sized patio with some garage sale looking cast off furniture. Our room was on the west side of the building and the view was nothing special - just a view of the mall and a not very interesting neighborhood of office complexes. The hotel is within a 5 minute drive to Beverly Hills and a 20 minute drive to the beach. The pool was out of order for half of our stay which was extremely unusual for a busy holiday weekend. However, because the hotel is nestled amongst high rises, the pool area never really got sunny. There is a health club attached to the hotel. However, the daily fee is $20 and is just one of the ways that this lackluster property seeks to nickel and dime its "guests". The hotel does not have coffee makers in the room because they want you to buy coffee from their Starbucks in the lobby. However, they do not open until 6 a.m. and for those of us adjusting from the Eastern Standard Time zone, it's annoying not being able to get coffee until it feels like it's 9 a.m. We did notice that there is ZERO checking of hallways for dirty dishes. We frequently saw discarded breakfast trays left for hours in the corridors. On the last night of our stay we tried to go to bed at 10 p.m. because we had a 7 a.m. flight to catch at LAX. However, after dark, the mall across the road apparently turns into the world's LOUDEST outdoor nightclub. The mall has several bars that BLARE music at levels reminsiscent of the music blared in military siege situations as a form of psychological warfare. (Think the siege of Manuel Noriega where the US military tried to drive him out of his complex by blaring music in an effort to drive him insane). When we laid down at 10 p.m., we could feel the bass beating in the room. Closing the patio door did nothing to decrease the pounding music. After an hour of hoping that the music would STOP at 11 p.m., I caleld down to the front desk to complain about the noise. I spoke with the on duty front desk manager, Clifford and advised we would like to move rooms to the other side of the building because the music from outside was so loud. He acted as if he had no idea about the music. He said he would send security to see if there was a problem. A half hour later, with no knock on the door from security and with the music from outside getting LOUDER, I called back down and asked to speak with the on duty manager. The operator gave me to Debra, the night manager. I advised Debra that we had called a half hour before to complain about the noise. She said that there was nothing she could do as her security guard had stood OUTSIDE our room door and heard no noise anywhere on the floor. I then went downstairs and confronted Debra. She initially tried to claim that there was no noise problem. I requested that she and her security guards come to the room to verify the noise problem. She initially said "That noise from the mall is a city problem and you need to call the police." So, in order to enjoy peace and quiet at their hotel, I would need to be the one who made a noise complaint through the Los Angeles police department - all while Debra STILL insisted that there was no noise problem. As we were waiting for security, she tried to make small talk about the weather. I told her I wasn't in the mood to be dismissed with idle chit chat and that I was stunned that a Hyatt property would treat their guests this way and that I would do all in my power to make corporate know about how poorly guests were treated at the Hyatt Century City. At that point Debra said they were a franchise property with no accountability to HYatt and that a complaint to Hyatt corporate wouldn't make a difference to her AT ALL. She didn't yet offer to move our room to the opposite side of the hotel. She did go up to the room with 2 security guards. One of the guards upon hearing the VERY audible music said "That's the way it is ALL NIGHT, EVERY NIGHT." So, I had an admission from a hotel employee that the music from the mall is ALWAYS like that at night. We hadn't noticed the nights before because we had gone to bed late and exhausted from sight seeing all day. It was now 1:00 a.m. and the hotel's own security guard admitted that the music was a very common problem. Finally, 2 hours after I had started complaining that we couldn't sleep because of the noise, Debra offered to move our room. We had to leave at 5:00 a.m., so by then there was utterly ZERO point in switching rooms in the middle of the night. We packed up and left at 2:00 a.m. So, if you would like to stay in a hotel that has music blaring across the street until the middle of the morning and if you'd like to stay at a hotel where 2 departments' managment tries to deny a major problem affecting "guest" satisfaction until a lower level employee conceded that the music is a constant problem - then the Hyatt Century City is for you. Oh yeah. Valet Parking is $35 a night and the valet is run be a separate company that is completely disorganized. It always took at last 20 minutes to "find" our car and we stood next to a couple who had been waiting for a half hour because the valet lost their keys. This hotel is a major embarrassment to the Hyatt Brand and we will NEVER stay in a Hyatt or use Pricleline again because of the lies, denials and utter lack of care for guest satisfaction shown by the property's managers Debra & Clifford. Horrible, horrible, horrible experience that ruined our intended long weekend "getaway". The getaway was when we left the awful, awful property that should have its Hyatt label taken from it.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.The web site fools you completely. I stayed at Hotel Pennsylvania from Wednesday, March 30, 2005 and checked out on Saturday, April 2, 2005. You may be wondering why did I stay so long if I considered it awful. Because I was with a group of 21 people from Michigan that prepaid for the trip. This hotel came "highly" recommended from the travel agency in Michigan which went through an agency in New York. Not only will I ever go through the travel agency again, but I will shout to the rooftops not to stay at this hotel. Yes, the location was a good one, but you could easily walk to different locations because the streets are not long at all, or you could quickly catch a subway, bus, or cab to where you want to go. As far as I'm concerned, Vornado Realty Trust (the hotel owner indicated on their website) and the managers have no integrity. I say this because it is no way that they would stay at a place with blood-like stains on the floor, sink, and shower curtain, mold in the shower, rust on the vents, stains on the lamp shade and telephone, carpet that causes you to never walk barefoot, stained walls, peeling wallpaper in the hallway, duct tape keeping the hallway carpet together (in plain site), and decrepit doors. Not only was the entire room decrepit, but the entire floor was decrepit. Mind you, I was with 21 other people. There were three of us in the room. If you risk going to the Hotel Pennsylvania, view the rooms or floors first. They actually have crappy floors, meaning that all the rooms are similar by the floor. I was on the 3rd floor. My last day, after hearing that one of the people in my group went and complained for the 2nd time and insisted that the manager walk up with her to view the room that they placed her in after her first complaint, she finally received a decent room after initially being placed in a room that looked as if yellow crime scene tape should be placed around it (that is how she described it), we decided to take a look at her final room. It was very small, but cute. She had a bathtub and shower with minimal mold (I feel all hotels should pull out tile in the bathroom if they are not going to take the time to clean it properly). She had a cherry oak headboard and small entertainment center that held her television. She also had a clock/radio and refrigerator. It took her to complain two times in order to get a decent room. This room was located on the 6th floor. We were on the 3rd floor and had none of these things. And don't think it got better the higher you went because the 18th floor seemed crappy too. We walked around on a few floors as housekeeping was cleaning the rooms. Now the person that gave this hotel a decent review because they've stayed in crappier hotels, I feel sorry for him/her. But I have traveled on business for years and this was supposed to be a leisure trip so I'm assuming my expectations are either much higher or his/her expectations are lower because of the experiences. And since I travel so much, I will make sure that my previous employer and current employer know to stay away from this hotel. Yes, they have nice rooms, but Vornado Realty Trust should not be trusted. After returning home, I noticed that their website does not describe the amenities in the Standard rooms. This seems to be the "type" of room that we had. On the site, the pillows on the bed are covering up the fact that you do not have a headboard and that the walls are stained. You also do not see the bathroom for these "standard" rooms. And the lighting is not an accurate account on the website compared to what was our reality. Stay away, stay away, stay away. And if you have invested in Vornado Realty Trust, you are investing with a company that has no integrity. On the home (main) page of their site, in the second paragraph, they state "Inside of New York's Hotel Pennsylvania, you'll find beautifully renovated rooms, with new furniture and carpeting, a work desk with reading lamp, large color televisions, AM/FM clock radios, telephones with voice mail, individual AC and climate control are only featured in select New York City hotels." We should have assumed "compared to what." Well, we found out it that it was compared to the crappy rooms that they have. Read between the lines. You will find these renovated rooms, but you may not get one. This is an integrity issue displayed on their website. On the Accommodations page, it states in the second paragraph "The comfort and security of our guests are always important to us." Maybe the security because they have a security guard by the elevators, but definitely not the comfort. We were guests and our comfort did not seem to be important because they would not have placed us in a room like that. Again, proving their lack of integrity. I was not comfortable enough to step in the shower barefoot, therefore I constantly called housekeeping to bring extra towels, lay them in the shower and on the bathroom floor in order to avoid contact with any surface. And if I did, I would rewash that spot that touched the surface. Does that seem comfortable? We were so uncomfortable that we avoided the room as much as possible. The only good thing I have to say about the staff is that the man that brought me extra towels each morning seemed nice and the lady in housekeeping that I called to request for the towels would say "right away mam." Also, the people at the information desk seemed nice and helpful. We would sit in the lobby if we knew we were not going right up to bed. And now that I think about it, maybe I can assume that most of the people that sat in the lobby had rooms on at least the 3rd and 18th floor (the crappy floors that we saw). We were not comfortable at all. This is still fresh in my mind and although my description may seem over-the-top, we were the ones that stayed there.Sharing my research & pediatrician did not recommend this formula.Hello:<br /><br />I felt it was important for me to share this review with fellow parents. I have been trying to make a decision on an organic formula (weighing the pros and cons of Earth's Best and Baby's Only) and I have done weeks of research, I have read the cornucopia reports, combed clinical studies I could find on the internet regarding DHA/ARA, websites of all the major formaula manufacturer's, research on hexane, etc, etc, and I finally talked to my pediatrician. Here is a summary of what I found:<br /><br />Earth's Best:<br />Major Pro: Milk-based. My pediatrician was adamant that the first ingredient in an infant formula should be milk. Despite opinions I've seen out there about the composition of carbs - lactose and other sugars - in breast milk and its similarity to composition in Baby's only, there is no doubt that formula should be milk-based. All forms of syrup - whether it is corn syrup or brown rice syrup are sugars, and not suitable substitutes for lactose. These sugars can not only lead to problems with obesity and diabetes later in life, but the lack of lactose does not sufficiently meet an infant's nutritional needs.<br /><br />Major Con: Hexane-derived DHA. By the way, it's not just the organic formulas that have this controversial method of DHA/ARA extraction. Every formula on the market - organic and non-organic has DHA derived in this way. I called every formula manufacturer to verify this. (Martek's LifeDHA is also white-labeled - so you dont always know that it is Martek. But if there is DHA/ARA added to an infant formula or food, whether it is labeled or not, it is almost always going to be from Martek)<br /><br />Baby's only:<br />Major Pro: No DHA/ARA - It is the ONLY formula on the market I can find without DHA/ARA - if anyone else can find another formula, organic or non-organic, let me know! I have literally scoured the marketplace. The only place to find it is Canada (Nestle Good Start) and it's not easy to purchase and ship to the U.S.<br /><br />Major Con: My pediatrician confirmed that brown rice syrup as a first ingredient in an infant formula is not acceptable. She says while Nature's One may market it as better because it doesn't spike insulin levels, at the end of the day it is still sugar, just a different form of corn syrup. She was very concerned that nutritionally this is not suitable for an infant. The other con of baby's only is that it is indeed a toddler formula. When you compare the mineral values you will see for example that the levels of calcium, phosphorous, iodine and a few others are much higher than in other infant formulas. In fact their vitamin/mineral content is more comparable to other toddler formulas on the market, like Good Start 2. I have researched that the higher mineral content could make an infant's kidney system work harder. Not sure of long-term effects, if any. This was outside of my research.<br /><br />Bottom line: I know that many proponents of Baby's only will say that the company is taking a political stance, in fact it does encourage breastfeeding until 12 months, but it also discourages the introduction of dairy milk at 12 months, which really goes against the APA recommendation to introduce dairy milk at 12 months. I have no doubt that Baby's only is meant for toddlers, in fact they tell you to consult a physician if you're offering it to an infant under 12 months. They don't do this for PC reasons, they are a company that cares about revenues, just like all the other formula companies. They say this because it is indeed a toddler formula meant for babies 12 months +<br /><br />There is no perfect solution out there. But I've decided to continue my hunt for a milk-based formula without DHA/ARA, whether organic or non-organic. In the meantime, I can only do what all other parents do - make the best choice having weighed the pros and cons. I choose Earth's best. Why? Because I've done enough research to feel confident that the likelihood of hexane solvent remaining in formula is highly unlikely. My research, which includes talking to a scientist that uses hexane in his laboratory, indicates that hexane is highly volatile and evaporates almost immediately. In other words, by the time it has extracted the oils, it should have evaporated. While you can never be 100% sure of anything in this world, the independent studies do show that no traces of hexane are in the formula). I know it's hard to believe everything you read, so I am only sharing all of this information because I feel it would be wasted if I kept it all to myself! At the end of the day, I feel the nutritional benefit of a milk-based formula outweighs the very small (perhaps non-existent) chance of hexane traces in formula.<br /><br />I hope this helps!The manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the resturant that we let and went some place else.We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to.This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food.(The sashimi is cut a little thinly.Since we were only paying £17 each per night for this hotel I wasn't expecting much. I wasn't expecting the room to be big. I wasn't expecting the room to be comfy. I was expecting the room to be clean and for the staff to be at least a little interested in the quality of their guests' stay. Apparently even this was too much to ask. To start off our awful experience, we arrived at the hotel after midnight, so nobody was in the reception to give us our key. Instead we had to phone another hotel and let them know we we had arrived. When I phoned I was told I would have to come and pick up my keys from the other hotel. When I asked how to get there I was told there should be directions on the door of the Earl's Court Gardens hotel. There was an arrow pointing right. When I told the man on the phone that that was all there was he proceeded to reel off a list of directions and then got annoyed at me when I had to ask him to repeat the directions, since we had gone the wrong way and had gotten lost. After all that we finally got to the other hotel and, after settling our bill and paying the key deposit, we were given the key to our room. There was a slight confusion with our money ("What's this?" "Pounds stirling. It's Scottish money" "Do you have any British money?" "Last time I checked Scotland was part of Britain") but to be honest I should have expected that since I usually run into problems with Scottish money when visiting England. There was also a problem considering we owed £68 but did not have change. We gave the receptionist £70 and were given a note explaining that we would have to collect our £2 change from our hotel the next morning and that there would be somebody there from 7am to make sure we got our change. The real problems started when we got into the hotel. We found room 203 with no difficulties, even if it was a bit of a squeeze to get through the doors even with our tiny suitcase. When we got into the room I had to cry. At first glance it looked clean but as soon as we looked up it was a different story. As well as several damp patches on the ceiling there was also a stain which, in the poor lighting we had, we were unable to identify. We decided it was either mould or poo. Either way it was very unpleasant. After this discovery we started inspecting the rest of the room a bit more thoroughly. The wallpaper was coming off the walls in places and the carpet was stained pretty badly underneath the bed. One window did not have curtains and the curtains on the other window were falling off. I opened the cupboard to hang up a dress and changed my mind as soon as I saw how grotty the inside of the cupboard was. If it hadn't been so late we would have left right then and found somewhere else. On top of that there's also the fact that our room looked out onto railway tracks. This meant that we didn't get to sleep until roughly 2am when the trains stopped going past and were woken at 6am when they started again. All in all a very poor night's sleep. We decided it was not worth staying in this hotel any longer. We phoned travel lodge and booked a room at their Farringdon hotel (which ended up costing us over £100 we had not been planning on spending), since we at least knew that it would be clean, and got ready to check out. This is when we discovered that on top of everything else the hot water was not working in the shower, the taps did not switch off and there was no soap for washing your hands in the bathroom. We got to the reception at 8.30am (an hour and a half after we were told that there would be someone there with money) and found it unmanned. After a quick call to the main hotel the receptionist dragged himself out of bed to serve us. He told us we would be able to get a refund for the night we were not staying but that there would be no money on the premises until 10.30am when the manager (who we never saw once during the whole ordeal) arrived. This seemed pretty poor to me, especially since the latest you're supposed to be able to check out is 11am and you have to get your £10 key deposit back. I think they just intend to scam an extra £10 out of many of the tourists who stay there. So we handed back the key and filled out a form saying why we were unhappy with our stay (which I refused to sign until I got my money back) and went and had breakfast at the nearby Sainsbury's. At 10.30am we returned. The receptionist told us several times to be patient and wait longer before walking out the door and coming back with some money. However since another couple were wanting to check out by this time he served them first and had to leave again to get the rest of our money. When he returned he gave me the form I had filled out back. When I reminded him that I wasn't signing anything until I got my money he said "No. You sign here and write 'No complaint' and I give you your money back. Trust me. Right 'No Complaint' otherwise it looks bad for me and I lose my job". After arguing about this with him for several minutes (because I had a fair few complaints about the room and the customer services) I finally wrote 'No complaint' on the form and we were given our money back. Except for the £2 change which then caused a further argument (I know it's not much but by this point it was the principle of the thing that made me do it). When we left we realised they'd given us all our Scottish notes back, which was the only laugh we got out of the whole thing. Throughout the whole ordeal the receptionist did not apologise once except for a monotonous "Sorry for your inconvenience" as we walked out the door. So two and a half hours after we first lodged a complaint and checked out (and four hours after we were told we'd be able to be served), we were able to leave. If I had one piece of advice about staying at this hotel it would be "Don't". The rooms are disgusting and the staff couldn't care less about customer satisfaction. I wouldn't wish this hotel on my worst enemy.Natura Park - vacation from hell! Natura Park ReviewWe (my husband, my 6 year old son and I) stayed at the Natura Park Resort from May 26th, 2007 to June 2nd, 2007.We have traveled to Punta Cana several times before, and it is safe to say 鈥?this was the worst vacation ever!!!!!!Here is our opinion of the resort and the (non-existing) customer service:Grounds: Beautiful landscape with lush greenery, lagoons, fish, flamingoes and, among other wild life, a bunch of geese. One of them, a large white male goose, viciously attacked my 6 year old son on the first day of our stay when we attempted to pass him on one of the walkways. The bird picked him so hard that he broke the skin in several places. Please do imagine the shock the child was under, since the bird, when aggravated and flapping his wings, was as tall as he was. Needless to say, I brought this unfortunate incident to the attention of the lady at the guest service desk 鈥?her response to me (in very broken English) was: This is an ECO Resort 鈥?Deal with it! I also voiced my complaint about the bird to the Apple Representative, who was told that the bird was very territorial and that management was aware that all vacationers as well as the staff were afraid of it. The only people capable of dealing with the animal were the ground keepers, since they had rakes, shovels etc. the defend themselves.We watched that bird attack 3 different people one evening within 10 minutes鈥? You tell me 鈥?is that something guests should be faced with as soon as they leave their room? Check In: Fast, again front desk staff spoke very little English.Rooms: Shabby, outdated and, above all, in bad repair. Toilet needed to get fixed sometimes twice daily, bathroom floor flooded, TV needed repair. Again, you need to walk all the way up to the reception to ask for maintenance, since if you try to phone the front desk or guest service, their English skills are not adequate to carry on a conversation.Pool: Dirty, even first thing in the morning.Food in the main Buffet Restaurant:Let me start by saying that we are animal lovers 鈥?but having birds sit in the scrambled eggs (and eating from it, of course) in the morning and subsequently walking through all the food platters is disgusting and definitely not improving anyone鈥檚 health. No wonder people were getting sick left and right. The food should have been covered up or one of the many staff members, just standing around involved in personal conversations could have chased the birds away.The food was tasteless, every day with no variety. They were also not very imaginative when it came to use up the leftovers from the day before. YUK. A la Carte Restaurants:First, they were just open one at the time, so if you were in the mood for seafood on Monday, you were out of luck since Monday the Steak House was open. Media Luna Restaurant (Steak House):We had a reservation for 6:30 PM and when we arrived on time, the wait staff was still setting up. They seated us, but didn鈥檛 even asked us if we wanted something to drink 鈥?never mind a menu 鈥?until well after 7:00 PM. When someone finally came to take our order, we asked for 2 beers and a 7-Up for our son. Not too difficult, one should think. We tried to order the Rib eye steak, which was not available that night and then settled for a Filet Mignon with mushrooms. Instead of mushrooms, the filet came buried under a mountain of onions 鈥?without any explanation. When after the meal we still hadn鈥檛 received our drinks (even though we had reminded the waiter repeatedly, we just got up and left. Staff is grossly incompetent.La Perla Restaurant (Snack bar during the day and seafood restaurant at night):Same incompetent wait staff from Media Luna the day before. Lobster was according to the waitress not in season so I ordered Shrimp pasta, which was the same pasta that is available at lunch with 3 shrimp on top. Very disappointing. My husband ordered the filet of sole, which was served under some saut茅ed veggies in aluminum foil. Lots of veggies 鈥?very little fish.Pasta Restaurant:We didn鈥檛 go since we anticipated the same lousy service and tasteless food.Entertainment: Nowhere to be found. No live music and the shows were marginal at best.Animacion: There were about 6 very disinterested people that gave us the impression they were just waiting for their shift to be over. Not much happening.Kids Club:This was the worst 鈥?we had picked this hotel since Apple vacations advertised a kid鈥檚 club from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.On our first day, I tried to take my son to the club and no employee showed up until 10:30 AM. I ended up leaving him at the kids club with a rather bored looking member of the animation team, who parked him in front of a TV and proceeded to put her feet up on a table and enjoy her book. To make matters worse, while sitting at the pool bar 鈥?we saw our son happily swimming towards us in the pool. Apparently, the girl didn鈥檛 understand she was to supervise the child until we would get back. Also, she informed us that the kid鈥檚 club was about to close for lunch from noon to 3:00PM!!!!!!!!!When I addressed the issue with the guest service clerk, I was again faced with an employee that spoke very little English and cared even less.So, if you have a child, stay far, far away from the Natura Park Hotel.Management:We tried to speak to the General Manager one evening about our concerns (that day that the toilet was still not working after they fixed it twice that day and the bathroom floor was flooded, we were told that it was dinner time and the manager was in the restaurant eating. We asked the front desk clerk to please call him and asked him to speak to us. The clerk even went downstairs to inform the GM, but no response. I was contacted the next day by guest services to make an appointment to finally speak with the GM 鈥?which I did. The appointment was set for 6:00 PM and when I got there (on time, of course) the GM was nowhere in sight. I was informed that he was on his way to the hotel and had car problems. Right! As we found out later, he used the same excuse for other unhappy guests that tried to speak with him.All in all, you can鈥檛 blame the staff for the less than marginal service 鈥?if management doesn鈥檛 care, why should they!This was by far our worst vacation ever 鈥?we will definitely never go back to the Natura Park Hotel.The folding chair I was seated at was uncomfortable.I sincerely hope this review reaches the highest levels of Cosmopolitan management. Something is severely wrong at the Cosmo and it's sad because the hotel has a lot of potential to be one of the top properties in Vegas. A planned seven week stay for a business trip at the Cosmopolitan was cut short to 17 nights. Staying one night longer was intolerable. The good and the bad and the terrible; with the good first to be fair: 1.) The Cosmopolitan has an unbeatable center Strip location right next to Bellagio. 2.) It’s new, striking and very hip. Great interior design. 3.) Excellent large room and suites done very stylishly and comfortably. Wraparound Suites are full apartments located on the corners of the building. 4.) The best Strip views of any hotel if you stay in the East Tower of the Cosmo. 5.) Food and beverage outlets on the second floor are away from the casino area. We tried them all and they are superb. The Cosmopolitan has one of the best groups of dining venues in Vegas. So the good points are very good. However, this stay was my third and final stay at the Cosmo. This year I’ve spent five weeks total as a guest in the Cosmopolitan. The hotel has some great points but the poor service negates all of the positives. I checked into the Cosmopolitan room 3793 on July 14 and checked out on August 1. During my stay I experienced some of the worst service imaginable provided by a very friendly and seemingly capable staff that just doesn't execute. Now for the bad and the terrible – it’s a long review of the bad and the terrible: Housekeeping and Maintenance: Upon check-in on July 14 into room 3793 I encountered the following housekeeping and maintenance problems: 1.) A soiled feminine hygiene product in the nightstand drawer; totally disgusting. 2.) Food from previous guests in the kitchen cupboards. 3.) Carpet so stained and filthy that it turned bare feet black. Drink stains glaringly obvious on the carpet. 4.) Hair and a sticky gooey stain on the nightstand. 5.) Burned out light bulbs in the kitchen, living room and bathroom. 6.) Filthy air conditioning filters and a room that wouldn’t properly cool. 7.) A telephone that wouldn’t work. For a hotel less than one year old the room was in a shockingly poor condition. Upon encountering the room in such a poor condition I called guest services which is called “Beck n Call” at the Cosmopolitan. After much insistence (it took three calls to Beck n Call) a housekeeping supervisor called me back. Robert, the housekeeping supervisor, was very friendly and genuinely concerned. I told him the carpet needed cleaned immediately and the room thoroughly scrubbed. Robert gave me a $50 Cosmopolitan gift card for my inconvenience due to unacceptable housekeeping issues (a laughably petty amount when taking into consideration that I was a guest with a planned seven week stay in a suite averaging $450 per night). To Robert’s credit the issues were taken care of quickly except for the carpet cleaning which took two attempts. Even after the second attempt it was still stained. Maintenance responded quickly and fixed the telephone, air conditioning and changed light bulbs. During all three of my stays at the Cosmopolitan a recurring theme occurs: the guest room is very shoddily cared for but if you DEMAND service it will be provided. However unless you are very persistent housekeeping and maintenance service is very shoddy. Daily housekeeping service was a chore. Beata, the day Floor Supervisor, is wonderful. She was the most switched on and professional employee I encountered at the Cosmopolitan. However Floor Supervisors change and when Beata wasn’t available daily housekeeping service suffered. Small things like removing the kitchen trash would be forgotten. Dirty kitchen floors went unmopped and other unacceptable sloppy housekeeping standards were common. When we encountered a good housekeeper and requested her every day she was working even this simple request couldn’t be organized by housekeeping. Noise: Noise is a huge issue at the Cosmopolitan East Tower. Even on the 37th floor the Marquee Day / Nightclub was very noisy. On Monday nights (service industry nights) the music was very loud even on the 37th floor. The noise was loud enough to prevent sleeping. If you select an East Tower room you have a lot of benefits including far better views than the West Tower. But noise from the Strip or Marquee Day / Nightclub are huge issues for East Tower rooms. Room Service Understaffed and hopeless sum up room service. 75 minute wait times for an order to be delivered? At the prices charged I expect quick delivery of food. That’s not going to happen at the Cosmo. Pools What a disaster; the Cosmo has three pools. One is the Marquee Dayclub which charges a cover and is very loud and crowded and definitely not for the over 35 crowd. The other two pools are so overcrowded that it’s impossible to get a chaise lounge. Even a spot to place your towel by the poolside is close to impossible. The overcrowding of the pool areas really put me off this hotel. I’m certain the Cosmo is going to lose a lot of non-party types due to the severe overcrowding of their two main swimming pools. Pool service – haha – what a joke. If you can even manage to find a chaise lounge don’t think they’ll be coming by offering drinks and Evian facial spritzers. This ain’t the Four Seasons……. The Guests / Crowd This average Cosmopolitan guest on the weekends is very young – under 35 yo – and there to party. My breaking point arrived when a very young and inebriated guest was being held up by two friends and projectile vomited in the elevator with a bit of it slopping onto my shoes. What else can I say about the Cosmopolitan? I’m glad to be out of there. Summary: Avoid this hotel like a plague if you expect good basic service and a mature adult crowd of guests. Service is very poor and the crowd is very young and party oriented.My wife and I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Venice on the Beach Hotel in Venice Beach, and I must say that this was arguably the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I believe that Trip Advisor rates this hotel at two stars, and I think that’s over-generous. But since I’m fair, let’s start with the good. The hotel is located right on Venice Beach, very near the pier and within close walking distance to all the sidewalk shops. It’s a great location. The bed, despite looking like the frame has been around since the 1920s, was extremely comfortable, even though it squeaked with every single little movement, to the point that you could hardly breathe without waking yourself up. That’s about where the good ends. I’ve noticed that no one on here has complained about parking. Well, there are, I believe, 8-10 parking spaces at the hotel, which apparently are not enough spaces to accommodate all of the guests. My wife and I arrived at about 12:30 for our stay. Checkin wasn’t until 3, but we figured we would see if we could get in early, as hotels generally are able to accommodate this. We went into the “hotel,” that is after we found it (we drove by the first time, because it looks like a regular apartment building), and no one was at the counter. We looked down the halls, checked upstairs, and it seemed there was no one in the entire building. There was a number on the counter to call, so we called it and got an answering machine. I stated that we were at the hotel and were going to walk around, and we were hoping we could check in. We then left and walked out on the pier. We decided to then go grab our stuff and walk down the beach. When we came back to the hotel, there was a maid in the hallway. I asked her if she could check us in, and she graciously did so. She said maybe two words to us the entire time she did this. She gave us a parking pass, not saying a word about it. The room was dinky, with no carpeting, just tile. The bathroom is very small and disconnected from the teeny, tiny shower. As I already stated, the bed was very old looking, and had holes in the sheets, comforter, pillow cases, etc. It also creaked with every move. There was a nice wide screen TV with DirecTV, but the picture was fuzzy, and the universal remote worked when it wanted to. Despite this, we were happy with the location, and figured we’d tough it out for the night. Later in the evening, we returned from dinner to find all the parking spaces full. I was confused, because we had a parking pass, so I figured there must be another place around the corner or something where we could park. My wife went in and spoke to the manager, who happened to be there this time, and asked where we were supposed to park. He came out with a map and told us that if we “exercised some patience,” we could find a spot on one of the other streets either a block or two away. We were very nice to this point, but I was extremely annoyed that my $140 a night did not include a parking space, and I was not told this until about 8 p.m. that night. We drove around for I believe two hours trying to find a spot, meanwhile missing the sunset that we both wanted to see. We then went back to the hotel and I went in to speak to the manager. He was no where to be found. I again went upstairs and checked all the hallways. I knocked on the “manager” door, where it sounded like there was a TV going, and no one answered. I went to my car, still not parked, very upset, and again called the hotel. He answered, and I said I was talking to someone earlier about parking and he tells me “I’m the only one you’ll ever talk to here.” At this point, I see him at the front door of the hotel, so I hang up and go talk to him. I told him he needs to give me some better advice for parking because we cannot find a space. He again tells me that we need to “exercise patience.” I told him that I no longer wanted to stay at his hotel, and would like at least a partial refund so I could find another place to stay. He said “that’s your choice” but informed me that he had “been holding the room for a while,” therefore I was getting nothing back. At this point I was irate. We drove around for another half hour and finally found a spot approximately one mile away from the hotel. We then had to walk back to the hotel through dark alleys when I had just read Venice Beach may not be the safest after dark. When we arrived back at the hotel, we were greeted with a snide remark from him. When I left the next morning, I told him that I thought they (at this point I was again reminded that he is the only person there that I would speak to, there is no “they”) should tell people that parking is limited. I said the parking pass implied that we had a space, and that isn’t the case. He shrugged me off and informed me that $140 a night is a great rate for a beachside hotel and apparently felt that was good enough reason for his poor service. The information I was given stated that the staff would do anything to make your stay enjoyable. They did nothing for me, except treat me badly. I did not expect a refund, I mostly expected an apology and the admittance that they should have informed me there were more parking passes than spaces. In addition, there was no air conditioning in the room. During the evening, we needed to have the windows open to keep cool. At around 4 or 5 a.m., trucks began driving up and down the street, waking us up every five minutes. In addition, you could hear water running from other rooms all night, and any time someone walked overhead, the entire building creaked. I saw a photo on here someone posted of their great view of the beach. Our room overlooked the alley/road behind the hotel, though I believe my room was the last available when I reserved it, so again, it wasn’t a big deal. The roof patio is nice, though there are no chairs or tables, only uncomfortable benches. It’s kind of a waste of space, as it’s useless without chairs, though if you fly in, you probably won’t have any with you. We will not return to this hotel, and I suggest that if you plan to park a car there, or get any sort of actual service, you do not either. It would be more worth it to spend twice as much than deal with this joke of a hotel.In Short The Black Sheep distinguishes itself from the Midtown pub herd with a look that's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch.This is what comes to mind when I read the reviews. We stayed in Disney for the first 5 nights before changing to this hotel. It is on the less hectic end of I drive and has ample free parking. The saving grace if I had to choose one is how friendly the bell hops and housekeeping were. Now to the experience that we endured. We arrived at 1pm and had lunch while the room was not ready, no problem as we were early. I helped the bell hop store our luggage in one of the boardrooms and he handed me the ticket stubs for our bags. We had lunch in the hotel bar that was fine. We were then given our key and we checked into our suite on the 6th floor. One of the lifts on our side was out of order and remained so for a number of days. We only had one bed in the room and had requested a double when we booked through our travel agent. When I called the desk to enquire about changing rooms I was told that I was on the transfer list and to call down in the morning. They explained the hotel was full and we could not be moved that day. I was then told that my travel agent had "forced through the booking" and that is why we had only one bed. I called the travel agent the next morning and was advised the room was booked in January and this was not the case that it was booked last minute. We rang reception twice before our luggage finally arrived and we were told that the reason for the delay was that the bags were put into a room with guests who had the same surname. This was hard to accept as I had handed the stubs for the luggage to the receptionist as I took the room key. The stubs were numbered so why was the name on the case used? More concerning was the fact we were told that the mistake was only noticed when the luggage was spotted outside the room where it was delivered. Thankfully nothing was missing from the cases. They were put in the wrong room where they could easily have been gone through. One of the chairs in the room was covered in stains and was a disgrace. How housekeeping had left this in the room is beyond me. The next morning I dropped down to reception to see about moving to a room with two beds. I was met by a girl who was in full flow of enjoying her first juicy fruit of the day. The packet was on the desk in front of her for all to see. She continued to chew the gum throughout the conversation I had with her. I asked about been moved and she advised they were completely full. I then had to push her to ask when would a room become available as we were there for 11 nights. She told me it would be on Sunday and this was now a Thursday morning. I thanked her for the time and agreed to move rooms on the Sunday. I walked past the same person later that day and she was still chewing away. I went back to my room and rang down to reception to meet with either the manager or the duty manager. I was told to come down to reception where I sat down with the duty manager and told him about my experience for the first 24 hours in the hotel. We came to an agreement in relation to the room that was appreciated and the chair was replaced. He also took away a sample of what was found around the sink in the upstairs. We were moved on the Sunday and the staff moved everything for us and even checked the wardrobe for items we did not pack. Again very helpful. What really disappointed me was no one ever came near us again to see if the new room was okay or even a note in the door to wish us a pleasant stay for the remainder of our time in the hotel. The breakfast was ordinary and Denny's provided our breakfast for most of the stay. One of the lifts on ourside of the hotel was out of order for 3-4 days at the busiest times while we were there. A sign was eventually placed on the lift that it was out of order and then when it was fixed the sign was dumped behind the elevator for a day or so before been picked up. The rooms were big but the air con was leaking through the roof of our first room, as it did beside the bar in the downstairs area one afternoon. The outdoor pool was disgusting as were the splash pools surrounding the main pool. Full of bugs etc. A rat was disposed off on one of the afternoons that I was outside. We used the pool once and that was it. It was pretty small also. Managers drinks was a great idea however from the 3 or 4 nights we were part took no management came to the table to say hello. There is a shop on the ground floor and the movies at managers drinks time was a good idea to let the adults relax outside the room were the movie was been shown. The lines to get to the bar were sometimes long when only one person was manning the bar. This was longer if you ordered two beers and a soft drink as the staff member would have to take the drink to the table as they were not allowed to be seen to serve more then two dinks per person, even soft drinks! There were free ices at the freezer in the reception, the security guard enjoyed these. Watched him make a few trips one evening. If you are going to stay then request a room overlooking the front of the hotel. As I said before the team of guys you had outside the hotel were fantastic and are a credit to you. Management could learn a thing or two from them. This is at most a 2-3 star hotel. I look forward to getting a response form the manager as I did not have the pleasure of meeting him in person during the 11 night stay we had, at least a message on the phone during the stay would have been nice John to acknowledge the problems we had. After reading all the reviews on trip advisor before we left I was sure we were going to be well looked after unfortunately this was not the case. Wished we had never moved from our first hotel as we ended up in faulty towers with Basil nowhere to be seen.Where should I start? I went with my husband and 20 year old daughter. This place is way over priced and way, way over rated! The first room was, (after we managed to get security to let us in because the electronic lock was broken) not the size room I reserved and paid for in advance and it was torn apart. The carpet was disgusting. The walls trashed and the vases or whatnots on the shelf next to the TV were broken and had sharp pointy edges. Luckily for our family we do not have small children. The couch, chair and stove where torn apart as if someone was in the middle of searching for something or perhaps got interrupted during cleaning. The trash was on the on top of the bar where guest are supposed to eat. I called to complain about the size and condition of the room and was told "Rooms are not guaranteed." What? They sure as heck took my money in advance to guarantee that I would show up! The least they could have done was to give me what I paid for! I was told "there is nothing we can do the resort is booked." No apologies on the wrong room no nothing - just tough. The front desk did agree to send someone up to clean the room, but when the maid got there all she did was drop off a couple of bars of hand soap and leave without cleaning a stinking thing. So resigned to getting ripped off and stuck in a substandard filthy room, my husband and I go to the bedroom to unpack for our two day stay and found that the linen was visibly filthy. I called down and ask for clean linen. Of course they didn't bring it so I had my daughter call back down and ask again. This time a male staff member was extremely RUDE to my daughter and asked her why I wanted clean linen. You would think that an explanation for clean linen would not be needed. The TV remote didn't work which wasn't a big deal until I tried to turn it on manually and found that the on/off button had been removed or yanked out. There was a whole where normally a button would be and I wasn't about to stick my finger in it so I called to ask for batteries. I think this fourth, fifth or sixth call to the front desk finally made them take note and miraculously a room (the type I paid for) became available. So now we are in room two after wasting hours of our vacation time. We get in this second room which at first glance seems to be cleaner and in better working order. We go about our day trying to enjoy the pool which by now is filled to capacity with nowhere to sit. We won’t discuss the issue with the pool towels and the policy on getting a clean one. Suffice to say, bring your own detergent. We go get lounge chairs and take them down to the beach where finally we can start to relax on our vacation. That night, my daughter goes to make her bed on the pull out couch only to find that she has no pillows. We only had three undersized flat pillows on our bed so we call down and ask for three more pillows. Two were to be used by my daughter and another one for me since a recent surgery requires I maintain a certain posture. This usually isn't a problem with most resorts. At any rate, I wait up fully dressed, listening to what seems like the loudest air conditioner on the planet and smelling something rotten emanating from the AC closet, so that I can answer the door when the pillows arrive. That of course never happened. I woke up fully dressed still waiting on pillows the next morning. We called down to the front desk another two or three times that day asking for pillows, only to be told that the maid or runner said she left them in the room (we were in the room – no one came). My daughter assured the front desk that we did not receive pillows, but was treated very rudely and suspiciously by staff again. Finally after hours of waiting and fussing with staff my husband and I went down to the beach. I won’t even go into the third degree the man at the wristband counter gave me when I tried to get wristbands for the pool area for day two. Apparently you have to put the hospital like disposable wristbands on loosely enough to take them off when you are not at the pool are (which for my husband is impossible) or wear the hideous red thing for however long your stay is, because they are only going to give you one. At any rate, my daughter calls me shortly after we leave the room to tell me, much to my horror and utter disbelief, that staff sent a runner to search our room. That was it! That was all the abuse I was going to take from these over puffed, over inflated, pompous you know what's, so I went to talk to management face to face. I calmly, because you get more flies with honey, asked for the manager in charge and was greeted by a very friendly young lady who assured me that they would be dealing with the runner who had the audacity to search a guest’s room. I explained part of the ordeal that we had been put through over the past couple of days and she seemed sympathetic. She told me to expect a phone call from a Robert somebody within the next couple of days. That never happened. I asked for corporation’s phone number on day one from a staff member at the front desk, but found that when I tried to call it, it was a bogus number! We checked out before 10:00 a.m. on our scheduled departure day. We could not wait to say good riddance to the so highly rated pathetic excuse of a resort. We all vowed to let anyone who asked us about the place know exactly what happened and what we thought. We vowed to NEVER AGAIN visit Wyndham's Ocean Walk Daytona. You would think the mistreatment would stop there, but nooo. Low and behold, when I got my credit card statement you will never guess what they did. You would expect that after knowing what their staff did to our family or how crappy and out of shape the rooms were that they put us in, they would give us a small discount, but noooo. They charged us for an extra room and I have been given nothing but the run around for going on two weeks trying to get it off my credit card! I’ve called the direct line of the gentleman that I booked the vacation with but he said he can’t do anything about it because it was a charge that the hotel or resort or whatever they claim to be, put on my card. I talked to several people at the resort before getting a hold of a manager or assistant manager who requested a copy of my credit card statement (of which I emailed her over a week ago). She stated that she would call me back the next day. But you know that never happened either! I’ve left her voicemail after voicemail, but all I hear are crickets. I have been reduced to disputing the charge on my credit card. My next stop, other than letting everyone under the sun know how miserable a state the resort is in and how absolutely despicable the staff members are, is to make a complaint with their local better business bureau, and the Central Florida Visitors bureau. Innocent law abiding citizens such as myself (who also happens to be a War Veteran) and my family members should not be subjected to having their only vacations ruined by such conglomerates.The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.We stayed at this hotel for 9 nights in June and we had a really bad experience. I had read the reviews and it seemed fine, but we were unfortunate and the staff had a bad attitude and didn't care. Surprisingly many of them seemed to be new to the place since they had to ask others, even make phone calls about basic matters. Checking in went fairly well and I mentioned that it was my husband's 50th birthday, but that was nothing that they seemed to care about, but that's ok, we didn't expect anything extra, but a congratulation would have been nice. I had requested a suite with a quiet location and a cot, but they were not aware of this, apparently not checking requests. We made the reservation through their own homepage. We got suite No 16 and it was quiet, a 2 bedroom suite on the upper level. The place is big so you need to drive to your room with the luggage, but there were spaces available close to our room at all times. Later they brought a foldable cot but nothing more. Fortunately we had brought our own pillow and blanket. The sofa bed wasn't made up and we found sheets in a plastic bag in one of the closets. The suite had good beds, but the stairs were not good for families with children, very steep and broadening at the bottom making them impossible to block off. Kitchen was good and well equipped. The first night there was a blockage in the toilet upstairs and at the same time a leakage, so that water was filling up constantly, until it filled up the toilet and ran out on the floror, the bathroom was flooded and it even dripped through the ceiling drenching all our stuff in the bathroom downstairs. I called the front desk and after quite a while there was a man who came and looked, but we couldn't explain what had happened to him since he didn't understand English, none of the staff did, except those by the front desk, and they hadn't passed on my explanation to them. We tried to tell them that the room had to be dried, the toilet fixed and the bathrooms thoroughly cleaned, but they didn't get it. I had to make inumerable calls to the front desk and it took 2 hours before they had fixed the toilet. I asked for the general manager and a young man turned up, he was most of all interested in how long it had taken buntil his men had come to help and he told us that they had told him that we had been flushing the whole night, a complete lie, which I explained. He wasn't very nice at all, didn't occur to him to apologize for the inconvenience or anything! We have 2 children, one of them only 1 year old, and we hadn't been able to use the bathroom since the night before, it took very much energy to deal with the flooding making all those calls and we couldn't leave our room without using the bathroom or our stuff and we couldn't since we had to check what happened. We missed breakfast and the manager said he'll credit $30 to our room , but he never did. To be sure I checked the bill the day before we were to check out, but there was no credit and the staff couldn't do anything and there was no manager on duty. I was told that "Melissa" was going to come at 5.30 and we had to leave early to catch a plane, but at 7 o'clock next morning she hadn't come yet, but there was another guy who I spoke to on the phone and he corrected the bill, but he said I had to walk there in person to straighten it out, which I did (more waste of time). The flooding would have been no big deal if the staff had shown the least interest and if anyone had apologized, but no one did, and if they had been able to deal with it efficiently. The front staff didn't care a bit and wasn't interested in listening, didn't even answer and no one offered anything, except for the $30 at the end, but only after an argue with the manager. Then there was the problem with our stuff that had been drenched. I didn't mention our toothbrushes and things because they were so unhelpful, I knew it was no use, but our laundry lay there in a big wet pile and I asked if they could wash it for us, nothing being offered. The manager agreed after a while to wash it and took the laundry, but after he left I suddenly realized that he'll probably wash it all together ruining the colors, so I had to make another phone call to make sure but he refused to wash the bright green, red and so on, T-shirts in different washes, only one dark and one light colors!!! So I had to ask to have our clothes back and deal with it myself, but then he even started arguing about the number of washes he wanted to pay for, because he was supposed to give me 1 dollar per wash!!! I told him to never mind, but there was an envelope enclosed with the dirty wet clothes with 5 bucks after all, that's peanuts to argue ver really. We had expected much more from a hotel, being part of this hotel chain. We lost many hours that day and the staff was really rude to us, this has never happened to us anywhere, we're normal nice people. Another thing that they failed on doing was delivering the telegram which my parents had sent to my husband's birthday. A special ld fashined expensive telegram, personally delivered. wrldwide. We stayed for 9 nights but they never gave us that telegram. On returning home we saw the copy which the telegram company always send, and the address was correct and complete, so why they didn't give it to us is really lousy. The staff was very inexperienced. Every time that I needed to get something from my safe deposit box, they looked like question marks, didn't even know that there were such boxes and certainly didn't know the routine, so they had to ask and make phone calls. Upon surrendering the box I had to argue to get a receipt that I had given them the key back. The woman didn't even know where the papers were kept, so I knew she hadn't dealt with it and you're responsible for the key and have to pay if you lose them. After a phone call she found my paper and I was to sign, but that line had already been signed, since I signed it when I first got the box, the man behind the desk not knowing the routine either, as always! The complimentary food was good and the cleaning of the room was good, the beds comfortable. There was complimentary papers to pick up by the front desk. Our memories of this hotel is really bad and all becuase of useless staff! If they at least had been friendly and polite to make up for all their mistakes, a smile and a nice way changes so much, but they didn't, nobody cared about us, despite me being nice all the time. The only one who was nice was a beginner who was on training. I guess this hotel is ok as long as you don't have any problems and don't use the safe deposit boxes and never has to deal with the staff in any way other than absolute basic business. The place is a chaos.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.For an establishment that has been open for only 16 months, why are the hallways at the Cosmopolitan a depressed greenish blue gray that makes you feel like you are in some kind of halfway house? I'm not talking about the casino, bar, and club areas, but rather the hotel part of the Cosmopolitan, where people actually stay, having been lured in by the pretty facade downstairs. The colors are slightly stronger in the hotel rooms but visibly fading, ours was a kind of suicidal blue-gray that makes you not want to be in the room alone. The stained furniture, dirty carpet, and pointless, trying-too-hard-to-be-hip decor also make the rooms appear ten years older than they are. The palm trees at the Bamboo pool, which our room overlooked, were strangely stiff and slightly gray- being plastic, after all. There is nothing more depressing to me than plastic palm trees, but I would have to say that plastic palm trees capture the superficial, creepy essence of the Cosmopolitan quite accurately. This is how our stay began: we waited nearly 40 minutes in line to check in on a Sunday afternoon (from 2:15 to 2:52 pm). There were six lines with at least a dozen people in each line. When we got to the check in desk, I asked the gentleman if such a long wait was common at the Cosmopolitan. The gentleman responded that it was a busy day, being a Sunday afternoon, and that there were also many people in line waiting to check out. I balked at the thought of again waiting in line to check out. The gentleman explained that they had an express checkout, but a lot of people were checking out in person in order to dispute charges on their accounts... The gentleman then informed us that our room would not be ready for possibly another three hours. He pointed out that it was 2:52, 8 minutes before official check in time. I asked if we waited 8 minutes, would our room then be ready? He responded that check in was at 3 and that the hotel had a three hour grace period on top of that. I pointed out that I had stayed at the Mirage and the Bellagio and never had to wait more than a few minutes to check in, if at all, or been asked to wait for my room. The gentleman responded that they were more popular than those other properties and that I could go to another property if I wanted, but since I had paid for my trip through Expedia, I would have to negotiate a refund through Expedia. Since we were in town for a convention, we gave up and headed to the convention without having had a chance to wash up. We finally came back around 6:30 pm to pick up our keys for the room. A different gentleman gave us our keys. I asked if we would receive any kind of comp for the inconvenience. He informed me that most people at the Cosmopolitan had to wait several hours for their rooms. To his credit, he was being truthful. Our friends, who had arrived a few hours before us, also had to wait over 45 minutes in line and several hours for their room, an hour for their bags, and over two hours for an extra cot to be sent to their room. Every time I walked by the check in area during my stay at the Cosmopolitan, there was a line. Any time between noon and 6pm, whether it be Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, the line was ten people deep. Even at 10pm, I saw six people in line, and only one check in desk open. I guess popular for the Cosmopolitan means not respecting their guests' time. Our room: When we first walked into the room we were impressed by the size and happy to see the balcony. Upon closer examination, we realized that the huge glassless window next to the bathtub meant that the bathroom had no privacy-- the toilet was in full view of the rest of the room if the shades were not pulled down.. and shades are for blocking light, not noise. Huge stains on the carpet, stains on the couch, trash in the dishwasher, trash on the balcony. The stains are even more obvious in the daylight, which could explain why the Cosmopolitan doesn't want you to check until later in the evening.. The Cosmopolitan also places various used books around the room and offers to charge your account for them should you decide to take them with you. Particularly disgusting was a thick book on erotic Asian art next to the bed-- maybe a sensual effect in your own house, but disgusting in a hotel room. At least our room did not have the huge three-foot diameter blood stain that our friends found on their balcony. If you are lucky enough to stay in a corner room with a wrap around balcony on the 23rd floor, look for the giant blood stain! I have never stayed in a hotel that left me feeling as haunted as this hotel. For the rest of our trip, we avoided doing anything besides sleep at the Cosmopolitan, and avoided interaction with the staff. I chose this hotel because I wanted a room with a balcony and the only options on the Strip were this and The Signature at MGM. I wish so badly now that I had paid attention to the other Tripadvisor reviews and not stayed at the Cosmopolitan. This is what I would like to say to whoever is running the show at the Cosmopolitan: Your common areas look vibrant and pretty, your restaurants, bars, and clubs are flashy and popular. Your casino area is wimpy, but I understand given the amount of space you have to work with. However, what ruined this trip for us was the interaction we had at check-in and the eerie hotel room. Your rooms are not showing their age, because they are not very old, they actually look much older. In ten years the carpet and furniture in the rooms will be completely stained through, the artsy books scattered about will be grosser than old library books, and the fancy pointless effects throughout the room will be wobbly and broken. Your hotel will be known for supremely poor service. Seeing as you are too cheap right now to invest in some quality service and durable furnishings for your hotel, your best bet for survival is to make sure no new clubs, bars, or restaurants open anywhere along the Strip that might compete with your only viable source of income. Staying at your hotel was the worst travel experience I have ever had.Terrible Facility I made a group booking for 15 family members to stay at your hotel from July 5 - 9th as the Yeldell Group. My husband and I were booked for an additional night and did not leave until the 10th. It is a shame that the hotel is not maintained. We finally stayed in rooms 202, 203, 206, 213 and 302. Room 202 had mildew around the bathtub, a cup of coke with cigarette buts in the window when they came and after 4 days of so call housekeeping the same remained in the window. Their linen was not changed even upon request. The party in room 203 was moved from 422. 422 was horrible; mildew around the bathtub, door knob fell of the door to the bathroom, room had a musty odor. Room 203 was somewhat better but it too had mildew around the tub and the party was unsuccessful in getting the bed linens changed. On July 7th they finally got fresh bed linen from the desk clerk and one of the party members changed the linen and made both beds. My husband and I stayed in Room 206. The room lacked overall cleanliness (mildew around the tubs, over the bathroom door), there was a nasty spot on the bedroom carpet and remained there when we left, the lovely faucets fell off in your hand when you turned on the water. over the tub. The wall paper was falling off the wall and the curtains (not drapes) were falling from the window and for 5 days no one saw a need to re-hang them. The door to 206 would not lock. With complaints we were able to get the door re-hung so it could lock, the faucet over the bath tub was replaced. The room safe for my protection was broke. We were not successful in getting the sheets changed even though we requested them to be changed on 2 of the 5 days. We asked for our bed linens tobe changed and went so far as to take them off the bed but the same ones were placed back on the bed. We took photos with our digital camera of the bed linen, the wall paper, the mildew the falling curtains. If you would like, the photos are available for your review if you have not already gone up to check out the condition of the hotel rooms. The party that checked into Room 213 was moved on the first night because there was blood in the bathtub and on the counter in the bath. What type of housekeeping occurred there. They were moved to room 302 and indicates after that their room was fine. The party that ended up in room 213 was moved there after the second night from room 122. Room 122 was awful. Bad odor in the room, mildew around the tub and door and a running water sound could be continuously heard even though the faucets in the room were not running. Please note that 213 was a room that a previous party had been moved from due to lack of overall cleanliness.Overall the stay was terrible. When we got to the hotel we were told we owed an additional $7.90 per night for the room safe and telephone service. I explained to the clerk that we had prepaid and was told we would be responsible for incidentals such as room service and long distance calls. I also informed the clerk that I had the confirmation from Hotel.com and it said, any incidentals such as parking, phone calls and room service will be handled directly between you and the hotel. He indicated that he was the clerk and could not do anything but require us to pay the charges as this was hotel policy and we could talk to the manager later that day. The following morning as group leader I went to talk to the manager and was told by Kevin that he was running late but would be in by lunch. I asked for a copy of the form that I had initialed as I had written my comments of disagreement on it. He said the copier was not working, this is the same things the night clerk said when I requested a copy of the form from him. Kevin did say he could go across the street to corporate office and get a copy and bring it to me later. I asked him to please get the copy but I would wait for him to return. He in fact got the copy and I waited about 15 minutes for him to return. I told him I would come back later on to talk the manager. I was given a business card for the manager and we went on our way. I came back later and was told that the manager was sick and would not be in until now the following day. I again expressed my concerns. The following day I was successful in speaking with the manager. After agreeing to disagree (He said that expedia.com and hotel.com had repeatedly misrepresented the hotel and should have included the $2.95 nightly charge for safe and $4.95 nightly charge for phone and internet service, that they had talked with them about this and that other guest had the same complaints. I responded that if you allow a company that you repeatedly do business with to Misrepresent your services then you agree with the misrepresentation). After a lengthy discussion, the manager agreed to remove the safe charges for the party but to include the daily $4.95 charge for the phone. We all had cell phones, we were on a family vacation and did not come to work and did not need to call any one since we were all there together. We felt we had hidden costs that should have been identified upfront. Our complaints were not satisfied. The desk staff were very professional, obvious that some form of customer service training had occurred, but they all tried to explain the problems away. It is a shame to have restored the facility in 1999 and have it look the way it did. The housekeepers did not have a vacuum cleaner or clean sheets on the carts so I guess cleanliness was not a goal. We had to ask for clean towels and the staff stated the linen had been taken by other guest as they had just finished with some kind of festival. What a terrible excuse for poor service. I booked our accommodations on Expedia after talking with Stan in group booking on April 14, 2004. However, I received room confirmations on April 16, 2004 as the Yeldell Group and were looking foward to having a good time since we had not been in New Orleans for over 15 years. We enjoyed the community but would not go back to the St. James unless there was assurance that the entire facility had been renovated and was maintained. I would suggest that management move from the front desk and acutally inspect your facility. I believe the accommodations could have been better if the place was maintained. What a waste for a historic restoration. I can not recommend your hotel for future use.Birmingham, Alabama 35217-1842I wasn't impressed and it wasn't SPICEY????the food - not worth the price.Pros: Good shower, low price, good dresser space. Cons: Lousy service, lousy functionality of room features (tvs, phone, etc.), freeway noise, inept management, lousy housekeeping, overwhelming odors, dirty lobby entrance, garage a questionable hang-out spot. Now hereâ€™s my story: From the website and the price offering this seemed like a great idea for my ongoing visits to LA to spend time with my son. How wrong I was. Here is how it all went down: Upon arrival, seemingly odd bit of sustained "hanging out" of folks in the parking lot (ground floor below hotel), something you'd expect more in a 7-Eleven parking lot, not in a place billing itself as a hotel and spa. I'll add that this continued throughout the visit. Also the cigarette butts stubbed out in the parking lot were numerous as was evidence of fast-food garbage and spent cans of beer, here's an idea, if that many people are smoking and hanging in your parking lot maybe a trash can and ash tray might be in order. The check in process was mildly encouraging, seemingly nice front desk. The room itself was at-a-glance on par with what you might for a newly appointed hotel. Nice bathroom with a clever sink and newer bed and linens but the floors are not really wood, some kind of plastic vinyl situation and this kind of is a common thread throughout, the room, faux, it kind of looks good but isn't really. The room was also a bit dark, but there was a patio. But a patio with a spilled Starbucks plastic cup and a big chocolaty coffee stain, which was not cleaned or removed during the whole visit. Room faces freeway on ramp. I get settled and unpacked and head out with son for a day together. Back in evening, flip on TV as is my habit pre bed in hotels. Blue screen, no signal. Try other TV. Nothing. Two remotes one not working. Since I am now in my night clothes, think best to call down to the desk and explain the problem. Hotel phone not working. Give up, go to sleep. Next AM. Try TVs. Nothing. Phone still dead. Get dressed, head down the hall with heavy scent of what smelled like about a kilo of fresh cut marijuana, seriously. I'm not one to just toss that out there, but it was pungent and breaking through the overload of air freshener they use in the halls. For what it's worth, the next day I didn't smell the dopey smell again, only the air freshener and that was noxious. Anyway back to the second day after a night and morning of no TV, no phone. Go to front desk and gently explain I have some problems. Desk says this will be fixed today. Canâ€™t fix it now because only the maid knows how to fix it (?) and sheâ€™s not here yet. I give her my son's cell and ask she call and let us know when all is fixed, so I can be reassured because my confidence is a little off kilter. Son and I head out for the day. Hotel calls, says all is fixed except the phone, phone can't be fixed. Something about needing multiple vacant rooms in order to fix the phone in this room, and by golly, theyâ€™ve been full since they opened. Do I have a cell phone or should they move me to another room? I say, â€œoh no need to move, I have my cellâ€�. It's fine, I can deal with this. Back at hotel after dinner. Son and I have doubts so he comes in to check the room with me. In lobby, manager is there, seems nice. Make some small talk about the NBA Finals and then head up to the room. Try TVs. Neither works. Phone still dead. Son and I head down to see the manager. Manager says itâ€™s a new property and thatâ€™s why he took the time to come in on the weekend. He says he knocked on the door earlier to address the problem, but we weren't there so he couldn't fix it. We try and explain we addressed it earlier and Hotel called and said they fixed it. He kept cutting us off as we tried to explain the situation. He says heâ€™ll come up to the room and fix it. Explains on the way that people sometimes misuse the TVs and thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re hard to use. Comes into room, adjusts something on back of one TV (voila, it works!), then tries the same trick on the other. No go. Tells us that remote control for second TV has no battery, that's the problems there. Would we be ok just using the one, ok sure. And that he is sorry but these things happen, we are all human after all. And would we like for him to buy us a drink. No thanks. How about some champagne he offers. No thank you. After he leaves I prep for next morning and find the coffee pot hasn't been cleaned. Ugh, so I clean it. Son leaves and asks to speak with manager, front desk staff say he is upstairs helping a guest. Son waits, and sees manager walk in from sidewalk outside hotel. Upstairs huh? Son meets him outside and explains coffee situation and asks if that is normal for this hotel? Manager explains that no, he is sorry and happy son isn't cursing at him, and that we are nice people, and that, â€œmaid must have lost her mindâ€� and offers to clean the room personally. And again offers champagne and drinks. No thanks. Son asks that his momâ€™s room and stay be without incident forthwith, could he see to that? Yes he says, he could do that. Next two days are without much incident. We say hello and goodbye and are polite but the earlier snafus are never mentioned by staff. Never see the manager again, although he is on premises. In the comings and goings the staff just seems sheepish, incompetent, and basically clueless. Last day there, back after an evening with son. Close to bedtime for a nice 65 year old lady. Knock on door. Manager wants to give me a bottle of some kind of champagne. I respond I donâ€™t drink champagne (I honestly donâ€™t). Guy at door tries to get me to take it, but I tell him no till he finally leaves. Checked out the following morning. Once again, the parking lot seems to be a hangout for folks who may or may not stay at this hotel. Me, never going back. And I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to hotel stays but in this case, fellow travelers need to be warned about this place. PS: At one point the manager offered a reduction in room rate. Havenâ€™t heard from him on that one since I left. ________________________________________ No virus found in this message.Do not stay at Eden H In one word: horrendous! However, one word is not enough to describe how truly terrible this place is. Others that come to mind include: horrible, dreadful, appalling, awful, ghastly and shockingly bad. Please save yourself the time and money and stay at home. 22 of us spent our family vacation and this hellish place. We covered every generation from 10 to 92 and amazingly all 22 of us had the same thoughts on this place. From arrival to departure I have never been part of such a debacle in my 30 years. Being a 6 year military veteran that says a lot. The 22 of us arrived at different times from separate locations yet we all had the same experience. It was as if the staff at Eden H didn't want us there. We had to wait forever to get checked into our rooms and the staff did everything theycould to prolong process. It was overly stressful, there was no communication, and every person in the lobby was frustrated. Mind you, this was 3 separate check in times, same experience. The service....well it was non existent. In fact it was a disservice! If the staff didn't see money in your hand, they ignored you completely. If you wanted coffee at breakfast you had to flag the coffee-guy down and more often than not you would have to go get him. Try to get coffee yourself and you were scolded. There are no beach butlers, they simply don't exist. If you want a drink on the beach you walk the 1/2 mile to the bar and get it yourself, in a 8 ounce plastic cup and don't forget the tip or you don't get your drink at all. Bottled water, bring it from your room orwalk the mile to the lobby to get it from travel representative, notfrom the hotel. Or you could fill up the 8 ounce plastic cup, but you may as well stay at the water dispencer, 8 ounces go fast. Now, onto the atmosphere. There is no place on this resort to relax aside from your room, which has a nice moldy smell. They blast mariachi music from 9:00am to 6:00pm. And the repulsive bartender only adds to the turbulent ambiance. At least 3 times a day the staff provide entertainment (distraction), from water aerobics to dancing. Of course, they too play music at obnoxious levels to drown out the other music and the previously mentioned bartender who, I am certain, is still screaming at the top of his lungs. Try to get away from all of this by finding a quiet spot on the beach, and there you have the recruiters for the flea market that stand at a demarkation line (literally a line in the sand) and harass anyone who dares to cross. If there is no one walking on the beach they stare at the beach goers and wave their tounge if they find you attractive. Moving onto the food. As bad as everything else about Eden H is, the food is the most inferior. Ihave never experienced anything this repulsive in my life. Of the 22 of us, 21 got sick. No lie, not an exxageration at all. It is slop.The meat is terrible. They have an executive chef on staff but serve nothing more than hot dogs, hamburgers, and french fries. I am not kidding. There is no seafood. Well, you can get lobster for an addition $30. No crab legs, no crab cakes, nothing. They have a meat and seafood restaurant but they only seafood is the $30 lobster. The meat, well you get the picture...the restaurant is called Meat and Seafood, not Steak and Seafood. We literally ate bread with jelly, french fries and ice cream for a week. Again, not an exxageration. When my 11 year old niece got swimmers ear and the Doctor on site wouldn't prescribe her ear drops because she was, get this, a young kid, the Doctor tried to strong arm us into taking her to the Punta Cana hospital. Enough was enough, I asked to talk to the General Manager, but I was only important enough to talk to the Resident Manager.When asked why we couldn't get medication for an 11 year old with swimmers ear he said the Doctor wasn't comfortable medicating children. Ridiculous! He then told us to talkto our travel representative. Dumbfounded! The Manager said he was there to provide a service, which they obviously couldn't do. We let him know how unhappy we were with all the issueswe had encountered to which he quickly defended everything we had to say and took nothing in a professional manner. He actually told us, I don't know why I don't know the answersto your questions. This was the #1 man on campus, the top dog, and he did nothing. If the management doesn't care why would the rest of the staff? Enough from me, I could go on for days. However, I will leave you with some other things to look forward to on your vacation. - Want a romantic moment in your Hot tub that won't hold water?The maintenance man will come take care of that for you by plugging thedrain with toilet paper.- Want to enjoy time at the pool with your children in a relaxing/safe environment?The maintenance crew will bring out an electric grinder with a 60ft extension cord pieced out 10 times just to place a water depth marker next to the pool. Yes, this is anelectric tool being used 1 foot awayfrom a pool filled with kids.- Get a bad case of diarrhea and want some relief?Too bad, Imodium AD is sold out because every other patron is in the same shape as you.- Voice your concerns to management about the food making everybody sick?Their answer...you drink too much!! Nice of him to assume I suppose. I would rather stay inside a tent in North Dakota in January than go back to this place!A nightmare I would like to forget. First let me start by saying Im not trying to be a negative person. Everything im writing is 100% true and actually happened to me all on this vacation. Im only posting this comment so other people wont overlook these bad reviews and make the same mistake i did.   I went to Dreams Punta Cana on Mon June 30th, 2008 with my boyfriend. We were supposed to stay until Mon July 7th but there were too many things going wrong to over look and just have fun. Im so angry with Liberty Travel (Brooklyn, N.Y. Kings Highway travel Agents Inna,  Manager, Rose) because they spoke very highly of dreams punta cana and did very little to make up for the problems we had. I will never book a trip with them again.  My flight was delayed going to punta cana, but that happens when you travel. Then we arrive in the Domincan Rep. airport. Very unorgainized and hot. No air conditioners anywhere in this place. They only use fans. Then we head to our tour bus picked out by Liberty Travel and wait for all the passengers to find their smashed luggage and board the bus.. They told us it was an hour long trip to the resorts. But for the small amount of miles you are traveling if they acutally built roads for you to drive on, it would only take 15 -20 mins. My trip to the resort took 3 hours b/c our bus broke down. It was very scary driving through broken, dirt roads with poor people sitting on the sides of them. Some local people walk along the roads with huge knives in their hand. You dont feel safe at all. Anything could have happened. The next bus came to pick us up and finish the trip. The 2nd driver drove very reckless hitting trees and fences and almost other vehicles. We got a flat tire on the 2nd bus and we rolled slowly the remainder of the way.  When we arrived at Dreams we found out that the dreams package we were supposed to have wasnt set up. That was the travel agents fault. But they said we would get our extra stuff included in the package. Then they brought us to our Honeymoon suite in Building 8. There was nothing special in it like our concierge said he would take care of. Like everyone else complained the room was so hot. The air conditioners are controlled so they cant be too cold or strong enough. I also noticed little ants on the sink and vanity. I called to complain. Right away someone came to fix the air condiitioner. I watched a man take apart the ceiling and drop it on the floor. I guess he restarted it or did something to make it cooler and a little stronger. Then he put the ceiling back together. Right there i knew how this trip was going to be. This is not a five star resort. More like a 2 star. The air was better but not like you have it at home or any other 5 star resort. They did give me the champagne and fruit basket , robes,etc later on but at that point i wasnt feeling happy to celebrate. I made my mom call the travel agent for me and explain what happend b/c the phones in the room were expensive. Inna the travel agent did nothing said I was a liar, what package?, its not her fault and i guess never told the manager of Liberty to call me. I tried to make the best of it waiting for the manager to call me.   The pool was full of kids jumping n screaming everywhere. If you want a chair by the pool, wake up at 7am and put your towel out to save them. Dont even think about a floating mat for the pool, there is only 20 for the whole resort. You have to fight people for them when they are not using them. They just hide them under their chair. The beach was full of seaweed and rocks. Not like the picture they show. That was what i booked my trip for a beautiful beach.  The food was terrible. Im from NY we have some of the best resturants in the world and this not what we expected for a 5 star hotel. Long wait times to eat. Very under staffed. Food made me sick. We ate at the french resturant and we ordered cheese cake and chocolate mousse. The cheese cake looked like an english muffin and the mousse taste like cardboard. The buffet for breakfast in the world cafe was ok but made me sick too. And No I NEVER DRANK THE WATER. Room service was just scary. Id rather have McDonalds. That night we had dinner on the beach in pitch darkness and that was the only somewhat edible food we had. By the third night the ant problem was bad. The ants had gone everywhere. They were crawling out of my clothes that were in the closet, on the night stand and phone when i picked it up to complain. We were disgusted. It was too late to switch resorts so we changed rooms, at 12:00 am. Now we were in honeymoon suite, building 7 which was the same. Very hot and had the same ants or whatever bugs they were. This room didnt even have a remote. We just went to bed with the smell of bug spray and waited for morning.  The next morning I got the manager of Liberty Travel on the phone. I told her we either wanted to come home or switch resorts. I mentioned the Excellence which was 10 mins away. I checked us out. We got in a cab and went to Excellence Resort. My travel agent didnt want to pay to ugrade me there even after everthing i went through b/c of where they sent me. The concierge saw i was very upset and gave me an excellence club suite without the perks of having the card but atleast it was something. The beach was beautiful here. The staff were very nice, spoke English and always tried to make you have fun.The food and drinks were much better here. The spa wasnt great though, very hot no air conditioner. The place over all more for couples, no kids. There was still a few ants I saw in the sink only but i think this problem was just everywhere in the Dominican Rep. They were in the spa, lobby, airport everywhere. My bf got very sick the last 2 days of the trip. His stomach was really bad. I gave him immodium but he couldnt leave the room. He was even sick for a few days when we got back home and had to call out sick from work. I have stayed at Excellence in Rivera Maya, Mexico and it was great. Not one problem. So I think it was just Dom. Rep. Punta Cana. I will never ever go back there. I will also never stay at a Dreams Resort anywhere in the world.  My trip cost me 3,500, Plus a huge phone bill for turning on long distance for my cell phone so i could call home and the travel agents, phone cards did not work there. $15.00 on another cab ride to switch hotels, $20.00 just to enter Punta Cana that no one tells you about, And a new luggage b/c i feel like the one i took is infested with ants and i dont want it in my house. I also had to dry clean and wash every item clothing i brought b/c of the fear of bugs. Dry cleaning cost me over $100 on things i had cleaned to wear there, that i didnt even put on. That is too much money too spend to go to a third world counrty. Its too much of a hassle for a vacation thats supposed to be a 5 star resort. More like an African Safari, not a luxury vacation. I have never had anything like this happen to me.   My advice, dont go to Punta Cana, or if you do pay with your Amex card so you can try and get your money back.We stayed at the Cosmopolitan hotel during our 4-day vacation in Las Vegas. I'll give a breakdown to what happened to our room each day we stayed at this hotel. Day 1: We booked a 1 bedroom suite with a pull-out couch. We checked in at 10 am. The service for the check-in was ok. However, once we got to our room things began to go wrong. The bed wasn't properly made and the pull-out couch wasn't laid out. I called room service and asked them to change the sheets on the bed and also to lay out the pull-out couch such that a person could sleep on it rightaway if he/she wanted to. You would assume that the housekeeping at a 5-star hotel would know what to bring up/what to do when the guests ask to lay out a bed. Then you'll never believe that the exact words of the person who answered the phone for housekeeping was "what would you like us to do?". I had to explain that you need clean sheets, pillows and duvets for the bed. Then the housekeeping person said that they don't give duvets for pull-out couches. I told them I would like to request one then. Then the housekeeping person said they would have someone come up and make the beds right away. After this, we went out and didn't return to the hotel until midnight. When we got back, the pull-out couch was laid out, but there was no pillows or duvet on it. We looked in the closest, and there wasn't any pillows or duvet in it either. I called housekeeping again and asked them where the things were, and the person (it was a different person now) who answered the phone said that they don't have duvets for pull-out couches. I then said I requested one that morning. The person then said they had a large number of arrivals and they ran out of duvets. I asked her if they had more now. She checked something (computer?) and said yes they have more now. Then she asked me what I wanted her to do. I said I wanted pillows and duvets send to my room rightaway. She said that it would take at least 2 hours to have the pillows and duvets send up and do I still want them? She didn't sound at least a bit sorry that it was midnight and that it would be 2 am before we could go to sleep. I asked her why she didn't send up the duvets when they knew they had more and waited until now for me to ask for one. She said she doesn't know what to say. The pillows and duvets arrived 2 hours later and we had to make our own beds that night. Day 2: We left our hotel at 2 pm in the afternoon. When we got back at 5 pm, as we opened the door, there was a vaccum cleaner sitting near the bar of the room. There were 2 dirty clothes hanging on the back of a chair and some extra towels on the same chair (which was strange since all the towels in the bathroom were changed). At first, I thought maybe the housekeeper didn't finish cleaning, but he/she was nowhere to be seen and there were no maid's cart in the hallway anywhere. I called housekeeping and asked the person who answered the phone to check the status of our room. She said our room was cleaned. I told her what I found in our room and asked her if she could have someone come to take the vaccum cleaner and the dirty clothes away. She said she'll have someone come up right away. We left again and didn't come back to our room until 11 pm that night. We found that the vaccum cleaner was gone. But the towels remained on the chair and there was something else hanging on the back of the same chair now, it was a dry cleaning bag. Day 3: We left at 11 am this day and didn't get back until 10 pm at night. This time when we entered the room, the pull-out couch was restored to its original position and the duvet and pillows that were on it were nowhere to be seen. I called housekeeping AGAIN and this time the person who answered the phone said that it was part of the service to have it restored to its original position. I said we need duvets and pillows. He said he'll have it send up right away. Then 30 minutes later, a person comes to our door and handed us a bunch of towels (apparently he thought we asked for towels). We said we asked for duvets and pillows, he went away for a few minutes and then returned with them. We then made the bed on our own that night. Day 4: We left our room at 1 pm and came back at 10 pm. GUESS WHAT? The cleaning person never bothered to show up and our room was left uncleaned. I gave up at that point to reason with housekeeping and just asked them to send up some toilet paper, tissue paper and clean towels. The person who answered the phone said that they'll have the things delivered right away. I waited 15 minutes and no one came. I called housekeeping yet again and this time a different person answered the phone. I asked her about the status of our delivery. She said that the delivery time is 30-40 minutes and that she never heard the person who answered the phone earlier (who happened to sit beside her) say that the delivery time is immediate. Everyday we would leave our room and come back to find some kind of nasty surprise. And then we'll have to call housekeeping and they can never get anything right. Our vacation could have been better without us having to constantly call housekeeping and asking them to do the most basic services like making beds, change towels, etc. We figure if we stayed 365 days at this hotel we would get 365 different nasty surprises at the end of each day. Our stay at the Cosmopolitan hotel has been an extremely negative one and we would never stay at this hotel again when we visit Vegas.First let me begin by saying do not use the travel agency we booked this hotel with since that was mistake number one. We booked our dream vacation through the dumbest and worst travel agency ever called Cheap Caribbean whose hired help consists of a bunch of TELEMARKETERS most of which are clueless how to book vacations for you. Cheap Caribbean has also been written up as Unsatisfactory by the Better Business Bureau (who I contacted to file a complaint for my money back) 38 times complaints on file in the past few years in the Eastern Pennsylvania BBB. That is pretty bad!! In the form of my most favorite comedian I am placing my review of the compound from hell Cheap Caribbean called a hotel. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF you like light airy room. Their rooms were OLD, dark, poorly maintained, smell like hell, with tile falling apart everywhere. Cheap Caribbean agency told us this hotel was charming & rustic. We would like to correct them and call this hotel a demolition sight. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you like to be able to enjoy views from your open windows and fresh air. THERE ARE NO VIEWS FROM ANY ROOMS IN THE PLACE and NO WINDOWS at all only sliding doors, which work sometimes, and once open everyone walking by your room can see in from one of many views. This goes for all the rooms. So if you like privacy and openness you will not find it here. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you like air conditioning. Most of the rooms have none and if they actually work it is minimally. You can’t stop sweating especially in the Summer month. We were unlucky enough to have a room which had no air conditioning. After 8 calls to the front desk (located a ¼ miles away from the rooms), the staff finally wandered over to our room at 10 PM. They defrosted the coils and about a small pools worth of water spilled out of the coils that were frozen solid. Bet this puppy has not worked for a while. They changed our room at midnight, we repacked our cloth, and my two 7-year-old twins cloth, woke the poor kids up and went to our new room. The new room had air conditioning but you could just barely feel it when it was placed on full blast. So you sweated a LOT in your sleep. My 7 year old son asked me on the second day of our stay if we had come to Mexico to die? I told him I hoped not and that is when I began packing again to make our great escape. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you don’t like being electrocuted in your own room. Yes in dead my husband turned on a switch the second morning we were in the room and he was thrown backwards by the bad electric switch this hotel called a light. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you like room service and well trained staff that knows what it takes to run a hotel and care that you are far from home. There is no one there for you friends. You are on your own. You will find the staff to be apathetic, useless, inconsiderate, lazy, and flippant even if you do speak Spanish as I can. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you expect the electricity to work for you and you don’t like being electrocuted in your own room. Yes in deed my husband almost bit it when he turned on a light switch the second morning we were in our new room and he was thrown backwards by the bad electric switch this hotel called a light. All I heard was of [----] and away he went backwards from the jold of electricity. Well that was clue #2 that maybe when a 7-year-old figures out that we should not really be here and my husband is almost electrocuted we need to get out of dodge. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you are traveling with a handicap husband with two bad knees and who can barely walk yet we were promised a hotel with easy access to all amenities about 16 different times from Cheap Caribbean. Each time I spoke to them they told me that my husband would be well taken care of. Yep leave it to those good old gals at the telemarketing school of how to make Cheap Caribbean rich while hurting their customers. There are no handicap anything here. My poor husband had to hobble to and from ¼ mile to eat about 6 times a day. If you needed ANYTHING AT ALL the service desk located in the front ¼ mile of the hotel you had to walk to them, they did not come to you because in all reality they did not want to walk the ¼ mile to get to you. Catalonia Playa Maroma may not be for you IF: you want to use a telephone. Don’t do it. This hotel knows how to nickel and dime you for everything they can think of. Catalonia Playa Marona is for you if: you like walking non-stop to everything you need to get to in 100% humidity and 100 degree temperatures. After two days from hell in the Maroma, with not a single person to help us with anything, my husband, myself, and our 7-year-old twins, left the hotel in a taxi in the hopes of saving our vacation and finding a hotel to take us in and hopefully save our vacation. The hotel attempted to stop us and the officiallys there gave our taxi driver the third degree about where we were going. He had to tell them or else.........who knows. On our first try at finding a new hotel we found heaven. The new hotel we stayed at was finally home. It was professionally run beyond our wildest dreams, cared about us in every way, room service came with a smile and in less than 15 seconds, had the MOST comfortable rooms we have ever seen, drop dead killer views from all the windows, huge Jacuzzi tubes, wine waiting for us with two glass wine cups, all inclusive even alcohol, fun fun fun people, elegant air conditioned dining facilities with 5 star cuisine and service unmatchable. Our new hotel was 360 degrees different from our hold hell hole……….our vacation was saved and we even stayed an extra week just because we liked the new hotel so much. Please be careful there are lots of really bad places in the Riviera Maya and you may never know it until you know what you are missing out on. I now know of only 2 really nice places to stay but that is it……………ask lots of questions. We have also found out that Cheap Caribbean. Com travel agency is not only a telemarketing company but it has not storefront at all. It is just a call in company. They have an address but they are not there if you go visit them. We have filed several complaints with the BBB, and the attorney generals office, which we feel, should shut them down. I hope all this makes some sense since I wrote it really fast……… photos from new hotel Happy traveling.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVEN,THE CRABCAKES ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE.When the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillis, definitely not edible by a human.Hi, me and my wife are left very much appalled and frustrated over the poor management rendered by Fragrance's Hotel and its supposedly 'senior' staff. We do not wish future holiday makers to suffer the same unjustice as we had, so please publish this letter to the better good of the public. We are regulars at the family budget hotels in Geylang. Me and my wife always go there for a short holiday and food whenever we are able to take time off work. It had always been enjoyable and Hotel Fragrance, amongst other more family suited hotels like Hotel 81 had always been our favorite. But the incident some time ago made me consider spending my bucks at more reliable hotels. Fragrance, no matter the restructuring and revamping, just doesn't deserve it. The staffs, even the manager I suppose, was simply low class and horrendous. Our last stay with this unpleasant incident was at Fragrance Sunflower. I had to make urgent business and personal calls that night and my cell phone was dead. Now, as with my experiences with other family budget hotels like Hotel 81, all you have to do was pay a sgd 1 dollar for use of the room's phone for all local outgoing calls the next 24 hours till check-out, in which the staff will very kindly and politely tell us the charges before use. There were even hotels in the same district where local out going phone use was simply free. This is common sense; if a service or commodity is rendered chargeable, it is your responsibility as a staff to inform the user of the relavant charges, and thereafter the user will decide the option to use it or not. There should never be any hidden costs. When I rang up the staff at the reception that particular night to express my need to use the phone in the room, the staff simply connected the phone line and did not rely to me that it was chargeable. And, as with my past experiences earlier mentioned, if there was no mentioning, it just meant that there was completely no charge. I was very disturbed the next morning when I needed to use the phone again and realised the line had been cut, and when I rang up the reception she told me that as there was a charge of 12 dollars to the phone bills already according to their un-mentioned rate, so she had to cut off the line till I pay up last night's usage. I find this absolutely ridiculous. I had used the phone less than 45 mins and there was an unknown 12 dollars charge which I unjustibly had to pay. The hotel room stay was only 50+ and I had to pay a good 5th on hidden phone bills? Now, the issue here isn't about the sum of the bills, 12 bucks is nothing. But how can you run a business this way? Isn't it your staff's responsibility to inform me of the charges should there be any so that I can decide whether I will be using it? Who in the world will want pay a 12 dollars phone bill for a 45 mins usage when there's a 10 cents public pay phone just around the street? And isn't it a really ridiculous thing that the phone bill should cost a good quarter or fifth of the hotel stay? What kind of exorbitant 'hidden' charge is this? Alright, never mind, I didn't wish to spoil my wife's holiday stay, so I held my composure and just told the staff very nicely that it really isn't right to inform the charges thereafter only. She should rely to us the rates on first hand before usage (which was so much higher than a public pay phone). But to my suprise, the staff told me that she was already very nice as she did not charge us another 10 dollars more for room usage as we had called in to ask whether there were any available rooms yesterday instead of a walk in. NOW, what is this? More hidden charges again? This staff DID not tell me that phone enquiry on the room was chargeable at all. Nothing was mentioned when I rang up yesterday. Is this the way your management practice business? This is rubbish really. When we checked out at the counter, the staff held us back and said that the manager wanted to talk about the phone bills which I had made my intension clear that I was not going to pay. What was really horrendous and made this trip a nightmare was the low class manager. First, he can't speak English, only Chinese. Ok, not an issue. Then, he threatened us that he was going to report to the police for us not paying the hidden phone bill. His attitude was really horrible. I thought there was going to be an apology on his part, but no, he was really bent on getting the unjustified bill settled. This were the unbelivable comments from Fragrance's Manager, a supposedly senior Management staff- 1. I will make a police report if you don't pay. 2. It isn't my staff's responsibility to inform you of all the charges. 3. If she needs inform you of everything, there will be so many things to inform you. There is no end to the list of things she need inform you. 4. Use your common sense, don't you need pay when you use the public pay phone? 5. Use your common sense, does my staff tell you to check out after a day? If not, why you still know how to check out yourself? You mean if she never inform you of the checkout time, you going to tell us you don't need to checkout? Well, belive it or not, these are the horrendous comments made by a supposedly Senior Management staff of an SME. So in what way do you deserve any credibility Fragrance? With a manager that kept mocked the 'common sense' of a paying customer, well, in the first place your management practice is the only thing with completely no common sense whatsoever. This is the biggest joke I have ever been told really. For someone to ask me if I need pay on a public pay phone? Well, the issue here is that I KNOW the public pay phone costs me only 10 cents per minute, unlike your hidden phone service, which was a use and extort me thereafter. And, yes, Mr Manager, I do checkout even if the reception does not inform me to, as I had only paid the stay of a day, which I jolly well know the rate before making the decision to stay too. I was left so shocked and disturbed, me and my wife just left. I can't even be bothered to argue with the Manager. Last week was my birthday, and guess what? My wife wanted to stay in Fragrance but another branch, and after I flashed my IC, the staff told me Fragrance had put me on 'blacklist' and that I am no longer qualified to stay at any of their branches. Wow! This is really the biggest joke of the year. To blacklist a victimised customer, so where should I go to 'blacklist' you Fragrance?It is some kind of long review but it worth reading for anyone think of booking at â€œFive Boutique Hotelâ€� Istanbul was the last destination of my vacation after Rome, Venice, Munich and Salzburg. I booked Connected 2 Family Rooms for five nights at â€œFive Boutique Hotelâ€� and what a disappointment !!!! - Upon arrival to the hotel on Thursday July 21st we have been greeted by the front office manager and he told me that he have one small problem that one of my two rooms are not ready as the leady who was staying at the room will not leave until midnight. After some argument and convincing him that I booked the rooms from the mid of April (thatâ€™s 3 months before), he went and talk to the lady and convinced her to move to another room. - After waiting for around 30 minutes for the room to be ready, the front office manager came again and told that he has another small problem that the AC in one of the rooms is not working and they faced some technical problem and it will be solved by tomorrow, you can imagine the situation with 3 kids tired and hungry, and after a long discussion, arguments and promises that the hotel is fully booked and this is a temporary situation and the AC will be fixed by tomorrow. I agreed to check in and put the luggage in the larger room (the one with no AC) and me, my wife and the three kids spend the night in the smaller room, two of us slept on the bed, one on the sofa bed and the other two we put blankets and slept on the floor. - Our two rooms was on the 7th floor and the tiny elevator goes only to the fifth floor and the remaining two floors you have to use the stairs, but no problem we are in holiday and you have always to think positive and not to let small thing ruin your family vacation. - The second morning and after having our organic breakfast which is in all the means not sufficient and has no verity specially for the little ones, I sat with front office manager and after thanking me for my understanding, I explained to him that we spent a horrible night and I will not allow it to happened again, he kept promising me that this AC thing will be fixed by afternoon. - I told him that today is my wedding anniversary and I heard about â€œAl Jamal restaurantâ€� as a very decent restaurant and requested him to help me doing a booking for me and my wife and he did thankfully. - I went with my family for a tour to the Aya Sofya, Sultan Ahmet mosque and Topkapi Sarayi and after my kids had their dinner we went to hotel around 8:00 pm to change and to go with my wife to celebrate our anniversary, when we reached the hotel I asked for the front office manager and I have been told by bell boy that he went home and he is sorry to tell me that the maintenance people didnâ€™t show up and the AC didnâ€™t fixed but he promised that will be fix by tomorrow !!! - You can imagine my feeling and my reaction, I started to lose my temper and threating to call the police in the face of the poor bill boy (who hardly speak English), the bell boy after he was refusing to call his boss and when he heard the word police he grape his mobile and call the boss who was excusing that it is the maintenance companyâ€™s problem not his and it will solve by tomorrow, I made myself clear that Iâ€™m not going to put my family for another night of misery and threating to call to police unless to be paid back for the remaining four nights, the Boss finally agreed and gave his instruction to the bill boy to write me a debit note for the refund of the four nights to be paid to me on Monday because they donâ€™t have money at the hotel and the bank closed for Saturday and Sunday. - It is 9:30 pm now I found myself and my family with no accommodation in busy city like Istanbul at the busiest time of year, I told my wife and kids to pack our stuff until I find another hotel, it took me more than 3 hours and checking 25 hotels all of them fully booked, have one room or only for a night or two. Finally and through one of the travel agent I found two rooms at â€œCentral Palace Hotelâ€� which was a way way better comparing to the â€œFive Boutique Hotelâ€� I went back to the hotel, took my family and the luggage, of course I didnâ€™t get any help from any one to get the luggage down through the stairs and the tiny elevator, everybody was looking at me as a bad news and glade to get rid of me. - I checked at the Central Palace Hotel around 1:00 am, I was tired, frustrated and angry from the worst three hours . - Thank you â€œFive Boutique Hotelâ€� for ruin my anniversary, for ruin two days of my 5 daysâ€™ vacation and most of all for the tension I found myself in looking for a hotel at the middle of the night. - I went on Monday and I found my money with the reception with no word of apology or any kind of compensation above of that the reception before giving me the money he requested to sign a disclaimer that I will not decline the payment paid by the credit card and not request any financial damage (which I did) but Iâ€™m writing this review for anyone who is planning to stay there to think again !!! it doesnâ€™t worth it !!!!! After telling my personal experience, letâ€™s critique and evaluate the hotel in logical way: - Location: the hotel The hotel located on a side street, the street has a very sharp slop, so you have to watch out if you have kids with stroller, the hotel is 10-15 minutes walking to Taxim square and Istiktal Street. - The rooms: the rooms I booked was in the 7th floor, one is convenient in size, but the second one was an attic kind of room, Iâ€™m 170 cm in tall I can walk only o the middle of the room then I have to bend. - The breakfast: The breakfast was limited and no much choice specially for kids, coffee and tea taste horrible. - Cleanness: I can say it was OK. - Value of money: overrated, overpriced hotel because of the mambo jumbo of the â€œOrganic Designationâ€� - Is the Hotel is Four star ???? absolutely not a Two or maybe Three star. - Last advice: there are many hotels in the area with better location closer to Taxim Square, Istiktal Street and the Metro station, with much better amenities and services with the same range of rate.No green beans, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion.Do not stay at this hotel!!!!! If you don’t feel like reading this entire review then the only thing you really need to know is that I would not recommend this hotel to anyone because we found a mouse in our room. Also, even if the mouse issue was taken care of, I still would not recommend this hotel to anyone based on the terrible customer service we received from the Assistant Front Desk Supervisor regarding this issue. My wife and I had booked and pre-paid for this hotel through Book-it.com for 6 nights in late May 2011. The hotel was listed on the website as 3 stars and was going for an average of $140 plus tax per night. Like many similar websites the identity of the hotel was only revealed to us after confirming the booking. We decided to take our chance considering the price was so affordable compared to other accommodations in New York City. The location was also great (Theatre district – next to Ed Sullivan Theatre, walking distance from Times Square and Central Park) and we figured if it was listed as a three star hotel it couldn’t be too bad. Some of our friends had also used the same website to book a “mystery hotel” in New York, through which they were also booked at the Ameritania, and had no problems - they said it wasn’t the greatest hotel but for only 6 nights and considering we probably wouldn’t be spending too much time in the room it was good enough. We didn’t have very high expectations for this hotel. These expectations went even lower after we read some of the reviews, however, the price was right and we were willing to put up with a less than ideal place for a few nights. We can put up with a lot…our main concern was cleanliness, mainly that there were no bed bugs. Upon arriving at the hotel I could see that the lobby and lounge area had been renovated fairly recently. It looked decent but we knew that this wouldn’t be an accurate reflection of the rest of the hotel based on the reviews that we had read. We were booked in room 215. Of course the room hadn’t been renovated yet, which explains the cheap price. On one hand I expected that we would be getting a room that hadn’t been renovated yet but based on the hotel management’s response to other customer’s complaints on this website (that renovations should be complete by May 2011) I had some hope that we would get a newly renovated room. Unfortunately, from what it looked like the renovations at this hotel wouldn’t be done for some time. It looked as though our entire floor still needed to be re-done…there were rooms with the doors left open that were completely gutted, construction material lying around, etc. I never actually saw any other guests on our floor (although I did see some contractors walking around) and it was eerily quiet which made me think we were the only ones staying on the floor. Who knows how many other floors were like this. The room wasn’t great which wasn’t a surprise. It was small (which we didn’t mind) and dark (which we also didn’t mind except for it made it hard to see if the room was cleaned properly). The first thing we did was check the mattress for any signs of bed bugs …thankfully we didn’t find anything. The floor looked like it hadn’t been vacuumed recently, the washroom stunk, and the bathtub had some hairs in it. The water pressure and temperature for the shower wasn’t consistent. Still, as we had low expectations anyways we were content with making this our home for 6 nights. It wasn’t until night number 4 that we had our encounter with the mouse. It was about 2 in the morning when my wife had heard some rustling in the garbage can and saw the mouse poke its head out. I saw it running along the wall towards the corner of the room. There are a lot of things that we are willing to put up with but having rodents running around our room is not one of them… I called the front desk to report the problem. At this point I was still willing to stay at Ameritania if they offered me a renovated room as we wanted to spare ourselves the inconvenience of having to move hotels in the middle of the night. The maintenance guy came up to our room and as he wasn’t acting surprised I figured this was a problem that he had seen before although he was adamant that he had never received any such complaints. The only other room that was available was another unfinished room directly above ours. I checked it out and it looked a little better but we didn’t take it. Front desk set up another hotel for us (Sheraton Tribeca). The Sheraton was great but it wasn’t as central and cost $330 plus tax per night. The front desk staff at Sheraton said that they had a few other guests from Ameritania transfer to Sheraton earlier in the night. The front desk guy working the late shift at Ameritania the night we checked out was fine to deal with. He was nice and seemed like he genuinely felt bad that we had to move hotels in the middle of the night. He was also the one who called around to see what other hotels were available. Unfortunately, he couldn’t deal with our refund and told us to contact the manager the next day stating that management wouldn’t be in until 3 in the afternoon. We were told that management would be advised of our issue. The following afternoon we went back to the hotel to speak with the Assistant Front Desk Supervisor. The supervisor wasn’t yet aware of our problem, which surprised me as I figured the issue would be a priority for management to deal with although, to be fair, he had just started his shift shortly before we arrived. When I explained my problem to him he initially told me that he didn’t have the authority to give me a refund and told me I had to speak to the Hotel Manager. I was disappointed that he wasn’t more willing to help out…I thought that, as a supervisor, he would make every effort to properly address a customer complaint, especially one such as this. After speaking with him for some time he finally said that he could approve a refund...which still wasn’t good enough as he said that he would only refund us for 1 and a half nights. Again he claimed that I would have to speak with the hotel manager who, of course, wouldn’t be in for a few more days and who he had no way to contact. Again, after some time he reluctantly agreed to charge for only 2 nights. He stated that we would have to contact bookit.com for the refund and only did so himself when I asked him to. I was content with this outcome although I was not happy with how long it took before he agreed to give a refund for more than 1 and a half days. Regardless of how cheap the price is and regardless of the prime location do not stay at this hotel. Even after the renovations are complete and the mouse problem is fixed I still wouldn’t stay here based on the terrible customer service from the supervisor.After the experience of the Hotel Icon I am intentionally writing my first review on trip advisor. Hotel Icon is the worst ever hotel we have stayed at. We always spend good money and stay at high end hotels on our holidays and usually the price we pay reflects the service that we expect. After reading all the reviews on trip advisor we decided to opt for the Hotel Icon over the famous Shangri La. Big Mistake. The allure of staying at this concept hotel as well as the harbor view rooms we decided to pre book and pay for two nights stay. Firstly our flight was delayed from Brisbane and we arrived in HK later than expected and we were at the hotel at 10am. The rudeness of the woman who checked us in will not be forgotten. We were abruptly informed that our check in would be at 2pm. As we had arrived earlier than the check in time and as we were extremely tired after a sitting on a delayed plane for a total of over 9 hours I was prepared to pay a full night stay for the four hours until check in. I was rudely told no. I probed and advised her that we both had a long flight and we just wanted to rest and shower, again this employee disregarded our requests and informed us to take the shuttle bus to the Shopping Centre. Clearly not travelled in her life or inept at understanding that the main concern here is that we want to rest, her attempts to pawn us off until 2pm were quite distasteful. We found her to be unresponsive and rude. We did not want to go shopping nor did we express any desire to but she continually insisted we take advantage of the free shuttle and go to the shopping centre. The fact that we were ready to pay for a room for a few hours as opposed to expecting us to be checked in earlier was clearly above her intelligence. We informed her that we just wanted to rest but she offered no explanation or reason as to why this was not possible. If the hotel were booked up fine we would have gone elsewhere but nothing. Interestingly enough, whilst we were at the desk another guest checked out and stated his room number to which she immediately scribbled down on a check in room card for us. Clearly she was under the impression that we are stupid to not work out that the room she had given us was this other guests and obviously would have taken time to be prepared. In the end she suggested we go up to the lobby on the 9th floor and we can use the showers there. Not having the energy to complain we decided to do this. Why she did not offer this to us in the first place is a mystery. We showered but were left unimpressed by our treatment and to make the situation worse, another guest took offence that we had our luggage with us in the lounge room. There was no facility to iron any of our clothes and furthermore we had to take turns to shower as we had all of our valuables with us. We then decided to leave the hotel and as we had pre paid we decided to return after 2pm. When we arrived I informed the staff member who I believe was Tim a supervisor of some sort of our experience at check in. He was a shining example of natural stupidity. To this day I have never been spoken to in such a patronizing way. I am amazed that someone is prepared to pay this man a wage. I explained to him that I was left unimpressed with the way our check in was handled and wanted some explanation as to why there was no option to even pay for another room. He did manage to tell me that they were fully booked as I suspected, why they did not feel comfortable telling me that is a mystery perhaps him and his colleague earlier were both not telling the truth. He attempted to explain that our room was not ready and then proceeded to inform me that hotels around the world have check in at 2pm and onwards and no hotel would let you check in earlier. Clearly shocked at the way I was being spoken to he continually informed me about how all the ‘top hotels’ in HK as well as the rest of the world had the same check in policy. I think he clearly misunderstood what the issue was and when I suggested to him that we were not impressed with his tone or what he was saying he preceded to laugh. He informed me again that all the top hotels have the same check in policy and they wouldn’t allow a guest to pay a full nights rate for four hours stay, as this would be seen as ripping off guests. I’m not sure if this employee had worked at top hotels however he continually tried to educate me on how 5 star hotels operated. Of limited capacity and lacking the basic understanding of what was being said to him he continued to repeat the same thing again and again. Having the privilege of staying at some excellent 5 star hotels as well as some of the best restaurants in the world I have never been spoken to like that before. Arrogant beyond justification and completely incompetent at explaining why there was such an issue when we checked in he jokingly apologized to which left me incensed. I could understand the complete rudeness of the first employee but this chap did an excellent job at illustrating ignorance. I am still baffled as to how this hotel could get so many positive reviews and yet treat us in this pathetic manner. To say this experience ruined our stay would be an understatement. I think these two employees need to be addressed as they have clearly limited capacity in listening or being attentive to us as their guests. I would not return to the Hotel Icon even if I were offered a free flight and free stay. This experience as well as the overall impression of the hotel leaves no doubt that this hotel is not 5 star. The lobby is impressive and the harbor view room is small. All the reviews of the showers are correct and the smell of the water, which is left after showering, is clearly an issue. As some of the reviews suggest that this is a college hotel perhaps they can teach their staff not to be so inept at understanding a simple request. We were not approached by any management or even offered an apology from the shocking service we received. Our stay at the Hotel Icon reinforced the fact that clearly some service sector employees are of limited intelligence and not able to grasp simple instructions. However it must be noted that the chap at the swimming pool and another whose name I did not know greeted us warmly every time we passed him. The location isn’t great however was fine for the purpose of our stay. In future I will keep to the big name hotels and certainly avoid amateur ‘concept hotels’ with idiotic staff members.Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more.This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.The service was dreadfully slow (the place was only half full) and a smile would have been nice...We stayed at the Cosmopolitan hotel during our 4-day vacation in Las Vegas. I'll give a breakdown to what happened to our room each day we stayed at this hotel. Day 1: We booked a 1 bedroom suite with a pull-out couch. We checked in at 10 am. The service for the check-in was ok. However, once we got to our room things began to go wrong. The bed wasn't properly made and the pull-out couch wasn't laid out. I called room service and asked them to change the sheets on the bed and also to lay out the pull-out couch such that a person could sleep on it rightaway if he/she wanted to. You would assume that the housekeeping at a 5-star hotel would know what to bring up/what to do when the guests ask to lay out a bed. Then you'll never believe that the exact words of the person who answered the phone for housekeeping was "what would you like us to do?". I had to explain that you need clean sheets, pillows and duvets for the bed. Then the housekeeping person said that they don't give duvets for pull-out couches. I told them I would like to request one then. Then the housekeeping person said they would have someone come up and make the beds right away. After this, we went out and didn't return to the hotel until midnight. When we got back, the pull-out couch was laid out, but there was no pillows or duvet on it. We looked in the closest, and there wasn't any pillows or duvet in it either. I called housekeeping again and asked them where the things were, and the person (it was a different person now) who answered the phone said that they don't have duvets for pull-out couches. I then said I requested one that morning. The person then said they had a large number of arrivals and they ran out of duvets. I asked her if they had more now. She checked something (computer?) and said yes they have more now. Then she asked me what I wanted her to do. I said I wanted pillows and duvets send to my room rightaway. She said that it would take at least 2 hours to have the pillows and duvets send up and do I still want them? She didn't sound at least a bit sorry that it was midnight and that it would be 2 am before we could go to sleep. I asked her why she didn't send up the duvets when they knew they had more and waited until now for me to ask for one. She said she doesn't know what to say. The pillows and duvets arrived 2 hours later and we had to make our own beds that night. Day 2: We left our hotel at 2 pm in the afternoon. When we got back at 5 pm, as we opened the door, there was a vaccum cleaner sitting near the bar of the room. There were 2 dirty clothes hanging on the back of a chair and some extra towels on the same chair (which was strange since all the towels in the bathroom were changed). At first, I thought maybe the housekeeper didn't finish cleaning, but he/she was nowhere to be seen and there were no maid's cart in the hallway anywhere. I called housekeeping and asked the person who answered the phone to check the status of our room. She said our room was cleaned. I told her what I found in our room and asked her if she could have someone come to take the vaccum cleaner and the dirty clothes away. She said she'll have someone come up right away. We left again and didn't come back to our room until 11 pm that night. We found that the vaccum cleaner was gone. But the towels remained on the chair and there was something else hanging on the back of the same chair now, it was a dry cleaning bag. Day 3: We left at 11 am this day and didn't get back until 10 pm at night. This time when we entered the room, the pull-out couch was restored to its original position and the duvet and pillows that were on it were nowhere to be seen. I called housekeeping AGAIN and this time the person who answered the phone said that it was part of the service to have it restored to its original position. I said we need duvets and pillows. He said he'll have it send up right away. Then 30 minutes later, a person comes to our door and handed us a bunch of towels (apparently he thought we asked for towels). We said we asked for duvets and pillows, he went away for a few minutes and then returned with them. We then made the bed on our own that night. Day 4: We left our room at 1 pm and came back at 10 pm. GUESS WHAT? The cleaning person never bothered to show up and our room was left uncleaned. I gave up at that point to reason with housekeeping and just asked them to send up some toilet paper, tissue paper and clean towels. The person who answered the phone said that they'll have the things delivered right away. I waited 15 minutes and no one came. I called housekeeping yet again and this time a different person answered the phone. I asked her about the status of our delivery. She said that the delivery time is 30-40 minutes and that she never heard the person who answered the phone earlier (who happened to sit beside her) say that the delivery time is immediate. Everyday we would leave our room and come back to find some kind of nasty surprise. And then we'll have to call housekeeping and they can never get anything right. Our vacation could have been better without us having to constantly call housekeeping and asking them to do the most basic services like making beds, change towels, etc. We figure if we stayed 365 days at this hotel we would get 365 different nasty surprises at the end of each day. Our stay at the Cosmopolitan hotel has been an extremely negative one and we would never stay at this hotel again when we visit Vegas.Let me begin by saying that I am always careful of reading bad reviews of hotels for a spectrum of reasons. Mostly, I am always suspect of the reviews where someone is clearly out get retribution for not being given a complimentary room for bad room service, or something that always seems insignificant to me. This review simply to point out this hotels shortfalls and what I believe to be misleading representation of itself. Also, before going further, I want to point out that I am in the hospitality industry, mostly through the financing of hotels and the disposition of them. I have worked for a hotel investment-banking firm now for six years and predominantly deal with Starwood (Westin is part of the Starwood Hotel Group), Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, and IHG flagged hotels. We have a North American office and a new office in London, that covers much of Western Europe. I share this in an effort to qualify my remarks regarding the Westin Key West. I know much of what the franchises expect from their flags/hotels. I booked a suite at this hotel from March 22nd-25th, for weekend fishing trip with two friends from home. Hotel accommodations were important to us, but not the most important for this trip, as we would be spending a great deal of time on the boat fishing during the day. However, a nice, clean and comfortable room was something we all agreed would be nice. So, when I saw the Westin on expedia.com, I thought it would be perfect fit, albeit the $625/night cost of room, which I assumed was due to spring break rate increases throughout the island. Plus, Westin has done a great job keeping the brand up to date and creating a hip feel to their hotels. We arrived and immediately were blown away by the fantastic location! Without question, this hotel is wonderfully located in the heart of Old Town Key West. You do have cruise ships that park in front of the hotel during the day, but they are gone before the sunset celebration, which is a lovely experince. We were fishing all day, so the cruise ships did not bother us at all. What was frustrating to my group, was the fact that this hotel was originally a Hilton Hotel and looks/feels like a Holiday Inn. Apparently the hotel â€œconvertedâ€� to a Westin recently, but other than the name being changed there is no difference. I admit they have upgrade to the standard Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Shower, which are Westin requirements, but that is it! The carperts looked as though they may have been from when the hotel was originally built. The TVâ€™s were from the 1950â€™s and BOTH of our controllers did not work. Our bathrooms were modeled from a Days Inn Interstate motel. They were old vermica countertops with a slab of reflective glass as a mirror. The tile was filthy were the grout was originally laid (something a PIP will kill this hotel on). The elevators were paneled with multi-color confetti paneling and slow. The staff(at least in the lobby)were all dressed in their personal shirts that ranged in type, but all had on Westin name tags. On Saturday, we had lunch at the bar upstairs, overlooking the water. We ordered fish dip for the 3 of us to share, each a salad and an entrÃ©e. The whole order was brough at one time, where we pointed out that we no longer wanted the appetizer then. At that time the server stated, â€œwe should have told him that we wanted the dip first.â€� What??? The fish dip was offered under â€œappetizersâ€�! In any case, the dip was aweful, our salads were warm and my grouper sandwich was â€œwetâ€� or raw. I also need to mention that the NCAA bball tournament was on TV, but we were unable to watch because they have two TVâ€™s facing one another that are positioned for the bartender only (minor detail, but worth pointing out)?!?!? On Sunday we went to have brunch at the hotels cafÃ©, wich I must say is a decorative nighmare for a Westin hotel. We asked to order off the menu as opposed to the buffet that was spread throughout the room with no rhyme or reason. We sat for 15-minutes before being asked what we would like to drink. No joke, we actually timed this as we figured something would go wrong. After laughing at the time this was taking we got up and left the hotel for another place to eat. I became aware that this hotel was originally a Hilton when I noticed, by the pool a sign that had Westin on it with tape. Upon another look you can see the word Hilton below the tape. After noticing this once, I noticed it several more times throughout the hotel, none more apparent than one of my towels having a Hilton Hotels label on it! So after rambling on here, let me make it clear that I understand things happen, but charging me over $600/night for Holiday Inn product and service is ridiculous. To anyone that is used to Westin standards, you know why we chose this hotel. Westinâ€™s are traditionally wonderful hotels and worth the rate. This however was the most horrible Westin I have ever, seen, much less visited. I should also mention that I did not make my gripes apparent to the hotel management, as I am one who believes you get what you sign up for and complaining does no good. It is unfortunate though that this hotel advertises as a Westin when it is not even in a Sheraton by Four Points league! Great location, horrible hotel. I have stayed at the Casa Marina in Key West before, and for a comperable price, it blows the Westin out of the water. FYI...I walked into the Pier House just to see the hotel and their rooms are the same as the Westin's for $300/night less!!! By the way...we caught 7 sailfish with Capt. Ken Harris!!!We stayed at this hotel for 9 nights in June and we had a really bad experience. I had read the reviews and it seemed fine, but we were unfortunate and the staff had a bad attitude and didn't care. Surprisingly many of them seemed to be new to the place since they had to ask others, even make phone calls about basic matters. Checking in went fairly well and I mentioned that it was my husband's 50th birthday, but that was nothing that they seemed to care about, but that's ok, we didn't expect anything extra, but a congratulation would have been nice. I had requested a suite with a quiet location and a cot, but they were not aware of this, apparently not checking requests. We made the reservation through their own homepage. We got suite No 16 and it was quiet, a 2 bedroom suite on the upper level. The place is big so you need to drive to your room with the luggage, but there were spaces available close to our room at all times. Later they brought a foldable cot but nothing more. Fortunately we had brought our own pillow and blanket. The sofa bed wasn't made up and we found sheets in a plastic bag in one of the closets. The suite had good beds, but the stairs were not good for families with children, very steep and broadening at the bottom making them impossible to block off. Kitchen was good and well equipped. The first night there was a blockage in the toilet upstairs and at the same time a leakage, so that water was filling up constantly, until it filled up the toilet and ran out on the floror, the bathroom was flooded and it even dripped through the ceiling drenching all our stuff in the bathroom downstairs. I called the front desk and after quite a while there was a man who came and looked, but we couldn't explain what had happened to him since he didn't understand English, none of the staff did, except those by the front desk, and they hadn't passed on my explanation to them. We tried to tell them that the room had to be dried, the toilet fixed and the bathrooms thoroughly cleaned, but they didn't get it. I had to make inumerable calls to the front desk and it took 2 hours before they had fixed the toilet. I asked for the general manager and a young man turned up, he was most of all interested in how long it had taken buntil his men had come to help and he told us that they had told him that we had been flushing the whole night, a complete lie, which I explained. He wasn't very nice at all, didn't occur to him to apologize for the inconvenience or anything! We have 2 children, one of them only 1 year old, and we hadn't been able to use the bathroom since the night before, it took very much energy to deal with the flooding making all those calls and we couldn't leave our room without using the bathroom or our stuff and we couldn't since we had to check what happened. We missed breakfast and the manager said he'll credit $30 to our room , but he never did. To be sure I checked the bill the day before we were to check out, but there was no credit and the staff couldn't do anything and there was no manager on duty. I was told that "Melissa" was going to come at 5.30 and we had to leave early to catch a plane, but at 7 o'clock next morning she hadn't come yet, but there was another guy who I spoke to on the phone and he corrected the bill, but he said I had to walk there in person to straighten it out, which I did (more waste of time). The flooding would have been no big deal if the staff had shown the least interest and if anyone had apologized, but no one did, and if they had been able to deal with it efficiently. The front staff didn't care a bit and wasn't interested in listening, didn't even answer and no one offered anything, except for the $30 at the end, but only after an argue with the manager. Then there was the problem with our stuff that had been drenched. I didn't mention our toothbrushes and things because they were so unhelpful, I knew it was no use, but our laundry lay there in a big wet pile and I asked if they could wash it for us, nothing being offered. The manager agreed after a while to wash it and took the laundry, but after he left I suddenly realized that he'll probably wash it all together ruining the colors, so I had to make another phone call to make sure but he refused to wash the bright green, red and so on, T-shirts in different washes, only one dark and one light colors!!! So I had to ask to have our clothes back and deal with it myself, but then he even started arguing about the number of washes he wanted to pay for, because he was supposed to give me 1 dollar per wash!!! I told him to never mind, but there was an envelope enclosed with the dirty wet clothes with 5 bucks after all, that's peanuts to argue ver really. We had expected much more from a hotel, being part of this hotel chain. We lost many hours that day and the staff was really rude to us, this has never happened to us anywhere, we're normal nice people. Another thing that they failed on doing was delivering the telegram which my parents had sent to my husband's birthday. A special ld fashined expensive telegram, personally delivered. wrldwide. We stayed for 9 nights but they never gave us that telegram. On returning home we saw the copy which the telegram company always send, and the address was correct and complete, so why they didn't give it to us is really lousy. The staff was very inexperienced. Every time that I needed to get something from my safe deposit box, they looked like question marks, didn't even know that there were such boxes and certainly didn't know the routine, so they had to ask and make phone calls. Upon surrendering the box I had to argue to get a receipt that I had given them the key back. The woman didn't even know where the papers were kept, so I knew she hadn't dealt with it and you're responsible for the key and have to pay if you lose them. After a phone call she found my paper and I was to sign, but that line had already been signed, since I signed it when I first got the box, the man behind the desk not knowing the routine either, as always! The complimentary food was good and the cleaning of the room was good, the beds comfortable. There was complimentary papers to pick up by the front desk. Our memories of this hotel is really bad and all becuase of useless staff! If they at least had been friendly and polite to make up for all their mistakes, a smile and a nice way changes so much, but they didn't, nobody cared about us, despite me being nice all the time. The only one who was nice was a beginner who was on training. I guess this hotel is ok as long as you don't have any problems and don't use the safe deposit boxes and never has to deal with the staff in any way other than absolute basic business. The place is a chaos.As a warning to others if you are considering staying at this resort. As per below, the letter that was sent to our travel agent in Nov/11 regarding cockroaches in the Emerald Suite we stayed in. We have not heard back from anyone to date regarding our concerns. Our arrival at the Valentin Imperial Maya was on Saturday Nov 19/11 and we departed on Saturday Nov 26/11. We stayed in one of the oceanfront Emerald suites, room # 13205, and had requested a suite that was not on the ground floor to avoid the insects in the room (as much as possible). The hotel did give us a top floor suite as requested. Before I get into detail about the cockroaches.. I'd like to add that when we checked in on Saturday Nov 19th my husband did tell the front desk that Sunday Nov 20th was my birthday. Later on that same evening room service arrived with a cake for me but my husband kindly turned it away and asked them to come back the following evening. They did not come back with the cake the next evening.. This was not a big deal but I was rather disappointed at the over-sight... On Monday evening when we returned from the tour to Chichen Itza (which was amazing!!) we were rather tired from the long day and I went to pick up the room service menu to order our dinner and a large cockroach came out of the menu and crawled up my arm. Needless to say I was quite shocked and let out a scream that I'm sure must have been heard all the way to the lobby! I shook it off my arm and it scurried underneath the bed. We didn't think much of this because we did expect to see a few bugs here and there as we do know the resort is pretty much located in the jungle. On Tuesday evening my husband and I wanted to enjoy the jacuzzi tub in the suite and proceeded to fill it up with water. As it takes almost an hour to fill up the tub we ordered a few bottles of wine and relaxed on the balcony until the tub was full. When the tub was finally filled we got into it and noticed a cockroach floating in the water in the tub! We were immediately disgusted by this, drained the tub and all romance of the evening was instantly diminished. We were then forced to sleep with all of the lights on (cockroaches do not like light and will come out in droves if the lights are off..), all of our clothes on and on top of the bedding at this point and through-out the rest of our stay in this room. On Wednesday morning my husband called the front desk and requested that they move us to a different room as we had enough, we had already seen two cockroaches and for every one you see you know that there are dozens you do not.. The front desk would not move us but opted to spray the room instead. When we arrived back later on in the day we could smell the pesticide in the room but were still unsatisfied that this would solve the problem and we continued to sleep with all of the lights on, our clothes on and on top of the bedding. On Thursday evening my husband killed at least six more alive and well cockroaches that were in the closet and shower area. We continued to sleep with all of the lights on, our clothes on and on top of the bedding. On Friday morning my husband called the front desk once again and explained all of the above and insisted that they move us so we could enjoy our last day and night with-out the stress of the cockroaches but they insisted on spraying the room once again and did not even consider moving us. When we checked out on Saturday we expressed our extreme dissatisfaction to the FOM as per the above. We asked her why were not moved and the only reason she could provide was that they didn't want to downgrade us! We spent a great deal of money on this vacation to rest and relax but after two complaints and four nights of trying to sleep with the all of the lights on in the room, sleeping with all of our day time clothing on and on top of the bedding, this was hardly a restful vacation!! The only real sleep we managed to get was on the beach.. We were much more tired and exhausted when we finally left the resort then when we arrived and we were more than happy to go home to get out of this infested room! All of of clothing and items that we took with us had to be thoroughly sanitized before we would even consider bringing it into our house to avoid the risk of infestation in our own home and we even considered throwing out all of our clothing! With all of this being said I'd like to mention that the resort itself was one of the most beautiful places we had ever been and the staff were a pleasure to speak with and quick to say hola! We are not green travelers and have been the the Bahamas and Dominican Republic quite a few times and know that the insects are very prominent in tropical destinations. If it wasn't for the cockroaches it would've been the best place we had been to date. We are not the types to complain about every little problem but if the hotel would've moved us as we originally requested the first time then this would not be an issue what-so-ever. We highly believe we are entitled to some sort of compensation for the lack of attention the hotel paid us in this regard for the inconvenience we suffered at this highly recommended resort. We would not like to post all of the above on the Internet linking it to the resort's home page as a warning to other travellers to avoid this resort if they are squeamish about cockroaches in their room...Hotel Vondel, 4 Starâ€™s you got to be having a laugh. Bad Experience for us Iâ€™m afraid.Having searched through tons of hotels on the net we plumped for this one. From the majority of trip reports it looked good. The fact that it was also advertised as 4 Star Hotel made our minds up. On the website â€˜Easy to Bookâ€™, it clearly states and I quote â€œHotel Vondel has 67 Modern (?) comfortable and attractively decorated roomsâ€�, it goes on â€œCharacterized by its unique interior design.All rooms provide outstanding comfort and convenience for both business and leisure travellerâ€�. This could not be further from the truth with what we experienced. On arriving at 14.45hrs our room was not ready. Not to worry we booked in and went for something to eat. Around 16.00hrs we returned. The staff were friendly and gave us the pass to the room. Up we went to the top floor. When the lift door opened it seemed that we were in the attic, we were met with building works going on. The main carpet was covered with another covering to protect it but this had crumpled up causing tripping hazards all along the entire length of the floor. A short turn left and we found our room, 404. Not sure what the other rooms are like but beware this room is dreadful. Remember the quote about attractively decorated rooms, outstanding comfort and unique interior design. Maybe our expectations are too much for a supposedly 4 Star hotel. The room was seriously small. With hardly any room to swing a cat, or put your suitcase. The decor was truly awful, dull and dreary like something from the 1950â€™s. One very small window let in the light but on looking out of it you looked straight into the skylight on the roof of the house next door. Another long thin window behind the TV that was on the wall had dark curtains drawn and was very awkward to get at, to even open the curtains let alone look out of it. The room had No Heating yet in the text it quotes about Comfort. The head board had these strange rings coming out of it, â€˜whats that all about!â€™ the mind boggles. We sat and chatted about the fact we were not happy with what we had found. In the end we decided that enough was enough already. The fact that major building maintenance was taking place outside our room, told us the floor should not be in use, the room itself was No way near Comfortable as stated. And this really put us off of the rest of the hotel. We went off and looked into another hotel. With room's available we went back to the Vondel and checked out. The staff member asked us to reconsider and to look at 1 more room they had available. This room turned out to be a flat next door to the Hotel and right at the top of the building. The place had no lift and my wife had to use her inhaler on reaching the top. This room/flat although being much bigger was still not suitable due to the stairs leading up to it. On returning to the Vondel we found ourselves offered another room, by another member of staff who seemed to take over from the guy who was dealing with us, yet we had been told previously there was only 1 more room available. At this point we again stressed that we wanted to go. Then the fun and games started. The new member of staff then said we would have to pay full price despite only being there just over 2 hours. I queried this by asking are you seriously going to charge us full price for a sub standard attic type room on a floor level that clearly should not be in use. Now, we expected to pay something but not full price! I said Iâ€™m sorry I cannot understand that, the hotel is clearly not as stated. Showing and quoting from the paperwork I had taken from the website advertisement. Again I was told we would have to pay full price. Fine I said but when I get back Tripadvisor will get a full report. And that may affect future clients for the Hotel. I said that I would also inform the Dutch Tourist Board of the situation and could they give me the address. The next bit amazed us. The hotel staff member told us that they did not have the address for the Dutch Tourist Board and they did not know it!! On saying that he then gave us our check out papers and said Iâ€™ve checked you out. I offered the money and he declined!! Saying I have checked you out I hope your next Hotel is better than this one, what he did not know was we had been to the 5 Star Marriot on the corner and booked in there, cost us a lot more but boy was it worth it for some comfort. Why when we offered the money did they suddenly refuse, was it something to do with us mentioning The Dutch Tourist Board!! we will never know. Keep away you have been warned.report on the royal monceau, paris booked on my way to paris an executive room (highest room level) nice quick and easy booking on the phone. said i was arriving at 12 (ie 3h later). arrived at 12 h30, nice reception contact, but room only available at 2 pm (ok it's typical for hotels of that standing) reception showed me the bar but left me there on my own to find a seat. the usual way of proceeding is to bring to a table, call a waiter and offer a coffee so the guest is taken care of by bar staff and not left stranded. after watching half a dozen guys moving around pretending to be busy  i managed to grab somebody asking for an espresso macchiato (stressing macchiato). 15min later he brought me a very beautiful cup of espresso. seems the macchiato got left out of the equation. by the way there must have been 15 patrons at the time (seating capacity is around 60) i don't correct this as i don't want to have to wait another 15min. crowd is the usual blend of high net worth individuals, small business meetings, corsican mafia, etc... bar is pretty soulless, bits and pieces of art (books, photos, small objects,...) no bar per se (ie where you can chat with a barman) as all preparation is done behind a wall of bottles and glasses. cute but they have to get a ladder to reach the good spirits. pretty comical. had to rush to an appointment and as i asked to put my ipad back into my bag as they were keeping it they brought me to the bagage room at the back to do so. i don't mind as it's quicker but standing means you don't show the ropes. somebody should have brought it back to me and taken care of that. went back to the hotel around 5 h30 brought me to my room. on the first floor (not great but they had told me they were pretty full with the le bourget air show), right next to the fitness center (that full?) introduced to the usual systems blabla. first impression. it's colorful, there's design furniture but it's crammed. toilet is near the entrance. they stuck the bed with the mini sofa and basicaly there's minimal space to navigate around the bed. miniscule bedside tables (i mean the phone was hiding the light switches). bag is on its stool but space for clothes is minimal (only half dozen hangers and space only for that many) i know i said i was staying alone but that is really bad. big mirrors on both walls with integrated tvs (i do not watch tv so no real use unfortunately). bathroom is very large with mirrors all over the place, fancy bathtub. design appliances. they forgot about the fact design appliances are not functional.  the unit where the towels are out of the shower is actually a radiator (yes that means you burn your hands the first time you grab it getting out of the shower) and i couldn't find the switch for the drain in the sink (and i really looked as i'm an engineer and couldn't figure out where the designer would hide it). its always nice to find that out after you brush your teeth. shower is great but shower gel and shampoo are really bland. cubic push down  bottles of unmarked bland product. i came back at 12h30 and went to the bar to grab a nightcap. same waiters too fast paced to check on patrons, took 10min for somebody to show up, another 10 to ask for my drink and more than 15 to make a whisky sour. nice drink but there were few patrons so it shouldn't take that long. ( i was texting my wife so i had an exact timing) to give an example an american staying with his wife arrived at the bar at 1h10 and was told the bar was closing at 1h30. they brought them menus at 1h20, took the order at 1h30. the guy asked for a nice single malt whisky. nobody in the staff had any clue. they showed him in the end the most expensive ("very nice single malt, a bit oakey" was the commentary they gave). i left at 1h50 and don't remember seeing a glass in his hand. and by the way the first time i went out pack in hand for a smoke the staff intercepted me and asked me if i was leaving (as in you forgot your bill). not very heartening. i went the next morning for breakfast with a friend who works nearby (i had booked a table the night before but not many people where there at 9h30. was very nicely welcomed and brought to a table, offered a glass of a fresh pressed juice of our choice and some very nice coffee.  then we ordered continental breakfast with some boiled eggs on the side. eggs arrived first, perfectely cooked and presented they were delicious. but then again people were "busy" wisking around and after some time we managed to grab somebody to get us the bread and fruit salad (and again it took a while). his french was pretty limited. he asked us if we wanted more coffee and he had such a hard time understanding "cafe au lait" that we ended up asking for "the SAME please". i hate raising my voice but the guys were really useless. my friend was also really annoyed (and we are very laid back people so it takes a lot to get us to that level of annoyance) i returned to my room at 11 to find out that somebody had come and took the dirty towels and half the bed sheets and duvet cover. i was booked for one night only they have a log of this kind of stuff and they should know not to clean before check out. also i've never encountered a room half done before. either people are in there cleaning it or they are not doing it. i decided to leave right there as it felt of being told to go. in the end it was a pretty bad experience, completely sub standard, and also it's a very soulless hotel which made the experience a complete flop (i'm a contemporary art collector and was expecting a lot as it's the signature of the hotel). i have stayed in most 5 star hotels in paris and i know what one should expect for that level of price.The actual hotel is quite beautiful, and in an excellent location in the heart of Amsterdam, just off Leidesplein. It is directly next door to the concert hall/theatre, and about 10 mins walk from the museum quarter, about 15 mins walk from the Bloenmarkt (floating flower markets). The rooms are tastefully decorated in an art deco/nouveau style, and the usual amenities: mini bar, electronic safe, tea/coffee making facilities, shower gel, shampoo. No dressing gown, slippers or iron though. Tv has good selection of channels for English speakers; BBC1, BBC2, Animal Planet, MTV, CNN. Our room 119, had a nice walk out balcony with chairs, that overlooked the fountains outside- was a little noisy at night. There are computers available on the mezzanine floor with internet access free of charge and phone chargers for most makes on the desks. And that's about all I can say positive about this hotel as we had a terrible stay.... My partner and I booked a 2 night stay at this hotel through lastminute.com after searching through hundreds of hotels in Amsterdam looking for one that was wheelchair accessible- my partner is disabled. This hotel lists itself as having wheelchair accessible rooms on both it's own website and with lastminute.com. We thoroughly checked this before booking so felt confident to go ahead and book. In the special requests box we requested a wheelchair accessible room, and explained that my partner was wheelchair bound. Upon arriving in Amsterdam, we were horrified to find that the hotel DID NOT have a wheelchair accessible entrance. We were faced with a flight of stairs to the main entrance. I went in and checked at reception for the wheelchair entrance and was informed that the hotel was not wheelchair accessible. I explained to the receptionist-Martha (who was actually very helpful) that we had booked a wheelchair accessible room. She informed me that they do have wheelchair accessible rooms but the hotel is not wheelchair accessible!!! Totally crazy! After much frantic calling to various people in the hotel she arranged for the concierge and a member of the bar staff, to bring my partner in through the bar entrance and then they would carry my partner up the smaller flight of stairs in the bar! I'm sure anyone reading this can imagine how humiliating this was for my partner. This was to be the plan for our entire stay at the hotel. Upset and tired from traveling, we reluctantly agreed as it seemed we had no other option. We went out and enjoyed the day in Amsterdam, and returned to the hotel. It took the staff 15minutes to let us in through the bar, and that only happened because I banged on the door! We called lastminute immediately to complain, and try to get moved to a more appropriate accommodation. Lastminute contacted the hotel manager to try and get us moved, but he refused to refund our money, so we were forced to stay for the 2 nights. Very inconsiderate, and selfish attitude. I can't believe they wouldn't let us cancel our stay and move to an accessible hotel. Later that evening we ate in the restaurant, as we were reluctant to tackle the whole entrance saga thing again. Surprise, surprise no wheelchair access! In order to access the restaurant we had to report to reception, and someone would then take us in the lift to the service entrance. In the restaurant, the service was appalling. We were sat at the table for 10minutes with no menu, and no drinks. We had to catch a member of the restaurant team and ask them to bring us menus and order drinks. We found the menu had little choice and was really quite pricey: starters approx 16 euros, main course from approx 20 euros. We opted for the 2 course set menu option. My partner went for the fish option and I went for the Roasted Poussin- what a mistake! When it arrived, i cut it open and the centre appeared raw, so I poked a finger in, and it came out with blood on it!. I tried a couple of times to catch a member of staff but had no luck. I decided to not eat it and let the waitress know when she came to clear the plates. When I informed her that it was undercooked, her response was 'that it's meant to be that way'!!!! Obviously not heard of salmonella in Amsterdam. Total bill was 67 euros for 2 courses with 3 glasses of wine, and I had barely touched the main course. Then we attempted to get back to our room on the 1st floor, and yes you guessed it- another saga. The restaurant manager took us to the service lift and sent us up to the 1st floor. When we stepped out of the lift we were faced with a flight of stairs! It was not accessible straight from the restaurant. The next night we decided to eat in the bar. Better choice of menu, and nice surroundings. Walls are covered in photos of celebrity visitors to the hotel so quite a nice talking point. In addition to my partner as company, we also had mice! Yes mice. Whilst sat in the bar we watched mice wander into the main area and then scurry back into what looked like a store cupboard. Luckily they don't bother me but if you are not partial to the furry kind then you might want to give the bar a miss, as when another resident reported it to the bar staff, he told her 'yes we do have problem with mice, I will try and catch it if it comes out again' .!! We hated every minute of staying in this hotel, and the hotel manager did not so much as offer us a complimentary meal or any discount off our final bill, for the humiliation and inconvenience we faced during our stay. Would never stay here again, and would certainly not recommend it. Needless to say, Eden Hotel group will be receiving a letter from me!Ok, so when you arrive your like ' Wow, Look at that building!'. The outside is pretty (granite and gold and connected to Symphony hall and located near everything... impressive right?). Then you attempt to park your car :-0 !!! Don't do it! Go directly to the valet because that is who you will use for the rest of your stay! To get in the garage you go up this narrow winding tunnel for about 11 floors! SO Scary!! When you finally get to the garage you would figure the hell is over and you can finally park your car and go to your room, right? Wrong! The parking spaces are narrow as well and so are the lanes to drive past them! Anything bigger then a Geo Metro or Golf Cart is going to have a hell of a time parking! My husband managed to park our Lincoln Towncar after alot of stress (still don't know how he did it... I'm impressed!) and as soon as we got out of the car we heard several other people complaining (several of them with small cars). Anyway it was a Nightmare! Then we headed to the lobby to check in... (you have to get on two seperate elevators every time you go to your room!). When we got to the front desk they thought it was funny that we even managed to park and we immediately signed up for valet parking at $5 extra making parking $25 :-0.... Not Including tipping the valet $5 each time he gets our car! (If he is driving it up and down that spiral... he totally deserves more!!!) Then we finally get to our room and for about 30 minutes, we experience the ooooh and aaaah of look at that view and look at this living room and look at the seperate tub and shower, 2 tv's and french doors leading to the bedroom and microwave and mini bar and room service and so on. Then after being there for about an hour all the awefulness starts kicking in! Two elevators to get our luggage (should have had them bring it... I know that now!). Every time we walked past the front desk (which you will do ALOT since you have to walk past it to get to the second elevator!) the employees were screwing around like little kids! On one occassion I heard them making fun of a guest loudly... totally unprofessional! Then back to the room.... The big blue velvet couch was pretty to look at but when you sat on it, it was very uncomfortable and made a crunchy noise like it was full of newspaper! The desk was all beaten up like it came from a used store! They had food and beverage items in the room that you pay for, which I am ok with but the prices were nuts! $3.50 for a bottle of arrowhead, $3.50 for a kit kat, $3.50 for a little bag of peanuts, $7.00 for a can of beer. Thats all I remember but anyway... nutty prices! The wallpaper was falling off and had a big brown streak across it in the living room (not even curious to know what that was!). The toilet had either a drop of pee or blood on the seat and from there I noticed that the bathroom wasn't clean! When maid services came... was it clean after they came? NOPE! Still dirty in fact they didn't even vaccume (I know because something was still on the floor) and I later found a card that said if you want your sheets changed place this on the bed..... was it placed on the bed before I got there? Who Knows! The sheets were the cheapest most ichy sheets I have ever layed on ($1.99 value at most!), the rest of the bedding was cheap as well. Fancy shampoos and lotions provided? Nope.... Panteen Shampoo and Vasoline Lotion with the Sheraton logo on the other side (good thing I brought better with me! ). The shower had one of those old cloudy glass doors and pink tile and mold everywhere! The shower head leaked badly! The bathroom floor was always wet! When you took a shower in that pink, moldy, dark little closet ... you could here loud trucks driving by on the other side of the wall (I was on the 17 floor). I thought a fridge would be included.... only if you pay extra and request it! This hotel is all about charging you for everything they possibly can! I am surprised toilet paper and pantene were free! Although I wouldn't care to stay at this hotel again.... (I stayed for 2 days) the valet was extremely nice and helpful! The outside of this hotel will impress and so will the lobby if the employees aren't present >:( and this hotel is in a great location! Walking distance from Gaslamp Quarter (which has tons of dining options), Balboa Park, San Diego Zoo, the boat that takes you to Coronado Island and Seaport Village! And only about a 10 minute drive from Sea World. You could almost get away with coming here with no car (would also save you on parking, valet, etc) because there are trolleys and a train nearby. This hotel charges about $199.00 a night I believe and I paid about $94.00 a night (Not Including Parking @$25.00 a night plus tips) through Hotwire. Sadly I still feel ripped off >:( !!One caveat: Some of the curried casseroles can be a trifle harsh.
